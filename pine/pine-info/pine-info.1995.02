This doesn't sound to be a bug to me because you may want to write a 
short note to your recipient so the whole message looks like this:

<headers>
<short notes, saying Hi and telling him/her you're forwarding something>
<your signature>

What does Pine 3.91 look for to determine whether the "+" flag should
appear in front of a message in the folder list?  Some personal messages
in my Inbox (or any other folder, for that matter) do not show the "+",
even though they appear to be correctly addressed.  Most of my incoming
personal messages _do_ show the "+", but enough do not to cause me to
miss important messages occasionally.  Several of our other users have
complained of the same thing. 
 
We're using Pine 3.91 SOL on a Sun Sparc Server running Solaris.2.3

Nope. That's not it. I have the same problem. With some addresse Fcc is 
recognized with others it isn't. (That is, Fcc is properly set even when 
I take the address from the message I'm replying to, but just 
for certain addresses (Fcc is set for all addresses in my addressbook)). 

My guess is this has something to do with how Fcc: is entered in the 
addressbook.

Suggestions, anybody?

Hi all --

Two requests:

1) How do I convert .addressbook format to .mailrc format (berkeley format)?
I have found brk2pine.sh in the source distribution, but I want to go in the
other direction.  I need this because I automate mailing and it is easier to
use mailx than pine for this, but I want to use the same mailing aliases as in
my .addressbook.

2)  How does one convert .mh aliases (  name1:  alias1, alias2, etc.), which
are pretty much the same as sendmail alias format, to .addressbook format?
This is to help a friend who is interested in converting from mh to pine.

I assume that all that is necessary is some awk or sed script, but I am not
the strongest at this.

Email as well as followup requested.

Thanks,

--

I've answered this by private mail a lot recently, so a posting is 
definitely in order.  ftp.celestial.com recently changed IP aggresses, 
and most of the world hasn't found out about it.  Someone (probably me) 
needs to prod them about DNS propagation.

ftp.celestial.com is now a CNAME (alias) for camco1.celestial.com, which 
is IP address 192.136.111.2

Another place to find my binaries package for Pine 3.91 for SCO is 
odi.cwc.whecn.edu.  They're on the other side of MCI from me, through 
Sprintnet to Westnet.  MCInet recently had a few serious routing 
glitches, so if you've been unable to get to WHECN, you probably can now, 
since MCInet has settled down.

Comes here Mr. Mr Kevin Yeung with this opinion in the "comp.mail.pine" group
in this article on 31 Jan 1995 10:47:32 -0800:

 +   I have several entries in my addressbook whose fcc's aren't sent-mail. 
 +   When I use the (C)ompose command to send a new message, the out-going mail
 +   is correctly copied to the corresponding fcc.  But if I use the (R)eply
 +   command to reply messages FROM these people, the out-going messages will
 +   still go to sent-mail, which is not what I want.  I have to manually edit
 +   the header everytime and I find this really troublesome.  Is there a way
 +   to get things work (I'm using Pine 3.91)?  Or will Pine 3.92(?) checks the
 +   addresses of all out-going mails, compare them with the entries in
 +   addressbook and copy them to the correct folders?  Thank you.

It works in 3.91, all you need to do is remove the default 'sent-mail' value
to the default-fcc: option in the setup/config screen. And add <Empty Value>
instead by A to add and hit return immediately.

But by doing this, you will not have a default-fcc for others who haven't
graced you .addressbook. Suit yourself.

Hi,
we use cutcp here as our main connection program and was wondering
if anyone has used the dos version of pc-pine with vanilla pktdrv
and the config.tel from cutcp? From the testing I've done, pine
can't seem to figure out how to connect to the nameserver to lookup
hostnames.
thanks,
/P

If someone out there in the Pine forest set up an HP (HP/UX 9.05) as a

I have collected some information from HP on this mixed environment and 
downloaded and installed a bunch of patches supposedly prerquisite to 
this configuration.

My problem is that the modified sendmail.cf file doesn't look like the 
sendmail.cf file on a Sun mail client, so I can't correlate the entries.

Couple of corrections

*enter news.gmu.edu where it asks for news server (nntp-site).

Enter news-server where it asks for news server (nntp-site). or if it 
does't  work ask you sysadmin for the exact server in you site

Manually arrange your .newsrc in the order you want
and if [X] is placed  in setup-config as above
  
		[X]  news-read-in-newsrc-order

pine shows the news in your newsrc order instead of alpha order

I have a user who dials into our system and uses a Mac Plus (hold the 
laughter, please). There is no control key on that keyboard. I know that 
you can use the ESC ESC key for a replacement, but he doesn't even have 
one of those. I can't put Pine in function key mode, again, no function 
keys. Does anyone have an idea on what he could do? I'm not sure what 
terminal emulator he uses.

Thanks in advance.

I am interested in the potential of using e-mail between sites in the UK 
and Russia for teaching language students. We have contacts in Russia but 
the problem is that I don't understand how to transmit Russian 
characters as opposed to Roman characters. It is possible to use the 
Roman equivalents but to do this one Russian character often requires 
about three Roman, in one case six were used. This is also not beginners 
stuff..I have spent all week trying to learn how to say hello, so I 
should know! I am not much more advanced with my knowledge of e-mail so 
any comments would be helpful.

Thanks

Vic

Edit the configuration file to say:
 
postponed-folder=""
 
The accompanying notes state that postponing a composition is not
supported.  This seems to be not just a consequence that the command
(CTRL/O) on VAX/VMS already does something different; there is an
alternative way to issue the command (ESC ESC O) but this does not
seem to work either (unless someone knows better).
 
Some of your other problems may be associated with choosing to configure
inbox-path=NEWMAIL.  I received advice from someone else in email saying
this is not a good choice, as things are today: it is better to leave
it as INBOX and then go explicitly to NEWMAIL.
 
I agree it would be nice if this worked more in accordance with VMS
MAIL procedures, but possibly it's not so simple to implement.  What
would I know, I'm only trying to use this package, not mend it ;-)
 
I'll be interested in the answer to your other problems (!)

This used to happen with another 3rd party mail implementation we used.
We fixed it by sending a mail to every new user, as they were registered,
using of course VMS "MAIL".  Sometimes the stupid solutions are the
best!

This works fine if I use pine directly on a Sun workstation (in an xterm
window) or if I telnet to the Sun from a PC clone running various PC
communications programs.  *HOWEVER*, when I telnet to the Sun from a
Macintosh using NCSA telnet, emulating either a vt100 or a vt220 terminal,
when I try to enter Control-^, all that shows up on my screen is a "6". 
That's right, no "[ Mark Set ]".  I've also seen this with some different
Mac comm programs when dialing in with a modem and received the same
result. 

My guess is this is a problem with terminal emulation and really isn't
Pine's fault, but I am curious if anyone has seen this and has a
work-around? 

I would appreciate any help you can send me!

	Well, for Chinese text I run pine in cxterm and then just enter
the text as a would in a text editor such as celvis (a vi clone with
2-Byte support).  Works fine....except there is no way to set the charset
to something standard....since there isn't a standard for Chinese in
MIME.  (Since the last time I checked.)

I would say it is.  When you are replying to e-mail, the quoted stuff
is considered to be part of your message, and hence the bottom of the
message is at the end of the quoted text.  However, when you are
forwarding stuff, your message is what you add to clarify things, and
usually implies that you are not making changes to the message being
forwarded, so your message ends before the included text.

	Mike, thanks. I also read your note in the newsgroup and have 
thoroughly read the man sort file but I still have a problem.
	I know you're prob. very busy but if you know where I can go?
	The prob. is that I have first lines followed by indented lines. 
They are CD-ROM titles with a few lines of descriptions and price.
	Prob. is I only want the first line of each little paragraph 
sorted by dictionary, not every line. That would put the whole thing into

I had the same problem at one time.  However with a little creative trial
and error, I found the sollution for it.  Hold the SHIFT key down in that
sequence (i.e.  CTRL-SHIFT-^).  That way it looks at the "^" instead of "6".

Good luck.

According to the documentation I read, the "+" appears when the message
received in in response to a previous message.  If someone sends you
an unsolicited message, there'll be no "+"; however, if they hit
(Reply) you'll get the "+".

Therefore, I`d say PINE looks for a References: line in the header.

Comes here Mr. AJDevoir with this opinion in the "comp.mail.pine" group in this

When all else fails, esc esc ^ (twice escape key, shift6) works for me, even for
^c, esc esc c works.

	Sorry, I believe you are mistaken.

	If you look in the help for the Index screen you will see...

   o "+" for direct-to-you.  The "+" indicates that a message was sent 
        directly to your account, your copy is not part of a cc: or a 
        mailing list.

	What I believe is happening is that pine simply takes the Left
Hand Side of the address in the To: field and compares it with your account
name.  If they match then you will get the "+".  

	Just to illustrate.  In the past I received my email on a system
call cosmo.  However, now I have a .forward on cosmo pointing to my account
on hobbes.  If you send email to egreshko@cosmo.twntpe.cdc.com it will 
show up in pine with the "+".  However, if you send email to 
Ed.Greshko@cdc.com I will not get the "+" since the match fails.  Note that
it doesn't matter what the RHS of your email address contains.

Subject: Bounce Command in Pine 3.91
Date: 2 Feb 1995 06:25:37 GMT
Message-Id: <3gptt1$76j@everest.pinn.net>
Status: O
X-Status: 


We recently went to Pine 3.91 and I just sent my first Bounce message to
the correct address and of course not knowing what will appear at the
other party's screen---in reference to the headers with the name of the
misdirected address etc. (about 20-30 lines minimum), can someone tell me
if "Bounce" will strip all the extraneous lines off before it gets to the
other party;  (Don't tell me to ask the other party the next day!) And it
will just show as a regular email message and hopefully no indication that
it had to be resent? 

TIA,

	Did you ever think about bouncing a message to yourself to see
what headers may or may not be added???

	Pine adds the headers:

Resent-Date:
Resent-From:
Resent-To: 
Resent-Message-Id:

	So, there is an indication that it was "resent".

in this article on 1 Feb 1995 10:43:18 -0800:

 +   I have a user who dials into our system and uses a Mac Plus (hold the

 +   you can use the ESC ESC key for a replacement, but he doesn't even have

Use the man page on 'stty' on your system for exact syntax for remapping
some other(any other) key in lieu of control key. Hope this helps.

Sorry, it is!
Select the ones you need to export
(eg ; n 1,5,17 - but there are other ways depending on the rules for 
selection)
then type
A E
and they will all be exported together.

I can't figure out how pico's justification works.
When quoting people I often need to enter blank lines between
or within paragraphs but hitting the return key often causes
pico to justify the paragraphs.
This might have something to do with the terminal emulation that
I'm using: NCSA Telnet for Mac.
Is there anyway I can prevent pico from "randomly" interpreting my 
return key as Ctrl-J.  Or, is there anyway to disable pico's 
justification altogether?

Thanks,

One of my users (and I agree with him!) has complained that it is both 
annoying and wrong that Pine insists on asking "Do you want to reply to 
Reply-to:" as that is what reply-to is for, and it is bad manners to 
reply anywhere else.
I also understand that this may well be a contentious issue, so what I am 
asking for is a config option "Always use Reply-to in reply".

No, there isn't.

The more interesting question is: why do you want to do this?

Do you or your users enjoy the prospect of having connections dropped due 
to a timeout?  Remember, Pine caches much more thoroughly than most NNTP 
clients, so it is perfectly possible for a very active Pine user to have 
a seemingly "idle" NNTP session.

I'm dialing in from a 6100 using ZTerm and it works beautifully. All 
commands work. The cursor pad is limited to up-cursor and down-cursor, 
but that's just because Pine doesn't recognize left and right to do 
anything. Try Zterm with ANSI or VT-10x emulation.

Our INN 1.4 news server software doesn't *have* a NOOP command!

This means that they get logged and reported the following day by e-mail 
as "host xxx used invalid command yyy".

Yes, I know the solution is to "fix INN to have a NOOP command"!  :-)

According to the text of the file, I have done this: I don't remeber doing 
it, but still ... .  Anyway the file .../nnrpd/nnrpd.c now has:

    ...
    {   "next",         CMDnextlast,    FALSE,  1,      1,
        NULL },
    /* BJC 941109A: added the following line */
    {   "noop",         CMD_unimp,      FALSE,  1,      CMDany,
        NULL },
    {   "post",         CMDpost,        TRUE,   1,      1,
        NULL },
    ...

It's at about line 100 of the file.  It would appear from the lack of 
other 941109A comments that that's the only change, but I'm not that certain.

You are quite correct.  I haven't read the documentation since I installed
the first version of PINE here.  I have no idea where I came up with this.

Thanks for the hint, I set it to 'by-recipient' and now when I reply to 
a message sent by somebody who also happens to be in addressbook the 
proper fcc folder is set. But now, of course, I won't get sent-mail as a 
default fcc folder for people who aren't in my addressbook, I get their 
username as default fcc....

Still unquoteable. (To much space at the left margin.)

Good morning,

I am a newcomer in pine-info.  I looked at the FAQ but did not find any 
answer to my problem. 

How can I configurate PINE so that my adress is 
Duhaimj@ircm.umontreal.ca and not duhaimj%terre@terre.ircm.umontreal.ca.

After registering to certain mailing list I got the following when I use 
the mailing:



You   are   not   authorized   to    mail   to   list   GOPHER-L   from   
your 
duhaimj%terre@TERRE.IRCM.UMONTREAL.CA account. You might be authorized to 
post 
to  the list  from another  of  your accounts  or under  a slightly  
different 
		....


Thank in advance for your help

Hi,

There is currently no IMAP implementation for the macintosh... if you forget
about Mailstrom, which is great but really limited when compared to PC Pine
for example. I'd be very interested in porting Pine to the mac, if I had more
time to do it. Time to do it no ? Are there people interested ? The code for
Unix Pine can be adapted but how to use it with MacOS GUI ? 

Any suggestion is welcome
Please report in comp.mail.pine too !

Replys are normally sent to the 'From' address, unless there is a

asked that option unless there is a different 'Reply To' in the 
incomming, so the situation only occurs maybe 5 or 10% of the time.

These questions *weren't* in the FAQ!

Does anyone have any nice sed, awk or perl scripts to convert 
.addressbook format  *TO* Berkeley .mailrc alias format?  This is so my 
automated mailing can use my pine addresses.

Also, does anyone have scripts for converting mh mailing aliases to pine 
.addressbook format?

I asked this on just the newsgroup but got no reply.

TIA,

Is there a unix curses or termcap emulation library for the Mac,
that would work with either MPW's SIOW ( Simple I/O Window ) or 
Think C's console ?  If there were, a straight port of the tty
interface could be easily done ( as could lots of other unix software )

If not, it might be better to just start a clean native GUI interface 
around c-client code. Has C-client been ported successfully to the Mac ? 

( I have a copy of a mostly working socket interface to MacTCP that I
 found at NCSA. For other reasons, for the project for which I hunted 
 that down, I ended up using the native MacTCP API. I still have an
 object library of it, but when I last tried to recompile it with the
 latest MPW, it didn't compile, and I didn't have time to look for 
 the problem, and again a reason not to use the socket interface showed
 itself, so I didn't look at it again. )

I've had the same problem using pine 3.91 over a dial-up. A couple of 
times pine dumped me clear out to the which host? prompt on the Michnet 
lines, and even trashed the Michnet connection. I set the flag to "slow 
modem" even though I have a 14.4, and have not had a lot of problems 
since. Sometimes still, though, 3.91 "goes to sleep" during a compose 
session, and I just go and make a cup of coffee. It usually wakes up in 
2-3 minutes. 3.91 is so much nicer than 3.89 that I put up with this.

Maybe it's not in pine at all, but in pico?

I have read the help info for folders and news folders, but was wondering 
if anyone has accomplished the following:
I can change one of my remote news folders to read
UseNet_Number_1 *{another.computer/nntp}[local.*]
and I get only the "local.*" groups. That part works. Here is my 
question- how do I put 2 items in the [], say local.* and morelocal.* ?
I tried UseNet_Number_1 *{another.computer/nntp}[local.*, morelocal.*]
but it thinks the comma separates another entry. I tried just a space and 
got another error. Is this possible?

I also haven't figured out that LINES environmental variable question (it 
affects pine but pico defaults back to 24 lines) if anyone has that answer.

For the MacTerminal keyboard (whatever that is), the ` (accent grave) sends
an escape.  Maybe two of those?

What does Binhex do and why is it needed? I have the same problem
when sending an attached file (simple text file) from a PC (with

to send and read the attached file (as a test), there is no problem.

Just sorting is not going to hack it.  Unix utilities such as awk or the
publicly available perl should handle the task.  In fact, one of the
examples in the original awk book covered this.

Comes here Mr. Vic Menayang with this opinion in the "comp.mail.pine" group in
this article on 2 Feb 1995 07:44:43 -0600:

 +   I can't figure out how pico's justification works.
 +   When quoting people I often need to enter blank lines between
 +   or within paragraphs but hitting the return key often causes
 +   pico to justify the paragraphs.
 +   This might have something to do with the terminal emulation that
 +   I'm using: NCSA Telnet for Mac.
 +   Is there anyway I can prevent pico from "randomly" interpreting my 
 +   return key as Ctrl-J.  Or, is there anyway to disable pico's 
 +   justification altogether?

Looks like the keymappings/settings aren't set right on your mac. I use
NCSA Telnet/Mac 2.6, and never had this problem. Go under Setup Keys
and see if you can re-configure your keymappings.

Hello,


OS: aix3.2.5
PINE: client and imapd and imap server are all the latest versions: 3.91

When I stay in "compose" idle or not idle, editing letter for too long
imap connection will break!!! Usually 10 minutes is enough to make 
it happen. And I am not the only one who experiences this in our
environment. Has anybody seen this? Does anybody know why this
happens?


Thanks,

Well, that's IMAP4, not IMAP2 (or bis or +). The most important
question is when IMAP4 servers and clients will be available!

 +   A user of mine (the same one!) wants to be able to configure the default

Either I'm missing the point or something...isin't there a default-folder
already set if you choose that option, the folder being correctly named
saved-messages  ?

	OK....

	cxterm is "Chinese Xterm".  It supplies an input method to
accomodate the various input methods used by the Chinese.  You see,
each Chinese character is 2-Byte...and there are many thousand Chinese
characters.  To enter one Chinese character may require 3 or 4 keystrokes
depending on the input method used.  I think cxterm provides for 6 input
methods.  Three for Hanzi (Beijing) and three for BIG5 (Taiwan).  It is
also extensible to allow you to add on additional input methods.  In addition
you can type in the hex values for characters.

	As for a vi clone....it is simply a program that has all of the
same functions of vi except that it is modified to handle 2-Byte characters
and 8-bit inputs properly.

	Let me know if you have additional questions....

The latest version is v3.10.  So you might try using archie to find
something nearby.

In case that doesn't work:

Here's a funny one. I pressed down all three buttons on my mouse at the same
time while the pointer was on the pine window (sgi 4D/35, IRIX 4.0.5, Pine
3.91) and the compose-bug-report function came up. It seems to be
reproducible. Since the bug seems to want to report itself, I thought I'd
oblige and send it along. I don't see this as a pressing problem (unless
taken literally, in which case it is - sorry for the pun), but I just thought
you should know...

	Not so strange....and not a bug.

	What screen comes up would depend on where you are in pine and
what is in the paste buffer for your mouse.  Just for fun, after reading
you message I moved my mouse into the pine window (main menu) and depressed
all three buttons.  I ended up in a compose session with an address from
my address book in the To: field.  Why?  Well, my mouse paste buffer
contained thac.  In the main menu the "t" and the "h" are undefined.
So, the "a", "c" key strokes were taken......

	So, no mystery....and no bug.

Well, getting along w/the world as we find it includes placating bnews,
cnews, & INN, at the least.  INN has never recognized NOOP & logs every one
of them.  While we're ok for now for spool space, we're hurting for / space,
which, for us, includes /usr/local/news & all its logs.  A days supply of
NOOPs takes over 10K of log space.

Sure, it can be argued that INN should be changed to accommodate every new
newsreading client that comes along.  I'd rather have all s'ware that speaks
or adds nntp get along w/INN as it is.

INN's timeouts are generous.  W/all the PC & mac rewsreaders on our net, we
see a few timeouts logged.  But they are trivially minor compared to the
NOOP logging.

Actually, there are several Mac IMAP clients.  Here is an excerpt from the

One of the Pine Team members did a little preliminary look at doing a Mac
port and was basing it on Mint.  But he dropped that in favor of a MachTen
port, which is complete and in Pine 3.91.

Yes, c-client works on the Mac.

X-Status: 

Can anyone help me with procmail? I'm about to give up on it. I thought I 
had the correct .forward file, but apparently not. Everything else seems 
to work ok. If I do:

procmail < test.msg 

where test.msg is a message I sent myself containing all of the proper 
headers and everything, procmail works perfectly. But when I send it to 
myself using Pine, one of two things happens. Either the mail never 
arrives or it does not get sorted like it is supposed to. I'm pretty sure 
I just need the correct .forward file for SunOS.  I have read the SunOS 
man file. It says:

 For  instance,  to  invoke  the  vacation  program,  user js
     creates a ~/.forward file that contains the line:
 
          \js, "|/usr/ucb/vacation js"
 
     so that one copy of the message is sent  to  the  user,  and
     another is piped into the vacation program.
 
 
I have tried:
 
"|/home/ma/csgrad1/treed/bin/procmail treed" 
 
as a way of passing it on to the procmail program, but it just goes 
straight to my normal mailbox. I have the permissions on the .forward 
file set world readable.  Any ideas?

Try:

"|exec /home/ma/csgrad1/treed/bin/procmail -Y #treed"

	Actually, I think your biggest problem is the treed v.s. #treed.
Without the # procmail tries to treat treed as an argument.

A fellow by the name of Chris Newman at CMU gave me a package called 
NiftyTerm which essentially is a VT100 emulator + Telnet application.  My 
thinking about a Mac Pine (PineApple?) would be to excise the Telnet 
code, and graft c-client, Pine, and Pico in its place.

c-client is ported to the Mac, and mtest runs just fine.  I have a nice
MacTCP interface for c-client that I wrote myself that (among other
things) runs a mini event loop so even though it's blocked on TCP I/O you
can still manipulate windows, switch to other apps, abort the current app,
etc.  Unlike Mailstrom's TCP code, my code works. 

I, like many others, have been very disappointed with Mailstrom, and
expelled it from my Mac's hard disk some time ago.  Mail Drop, on the
other hand, works quiet well, if a bare-bones IMAP client is alright.  I
have higher hopes of seeing Mail Drop get dolled up than I have of seeing
a usable Mailstrom. 

The main thing you would need to do in c-client on the Mac is have some 
sort of monitor/throttle on memory use so c-client can cache, but purge 
the cache (via mail_gc() calls) as necessary when memory becomes low.  
This idea was originally going to be used in PC-Pine, but memory is so 
tight in the 640K limit that we ended up not caching at all.  On the Mac, 
I'd give it a meg or two of free memory to play around in.

I've thought of writing my own native GUI interface for the Mac, but I 
have plenty of other things to do.  What's more, my GUIs tend to reflect 
the fact that I'm an engineer, not an artist -- hyper-functional, but not 
necessarily pretty, with button panels from hell.

I've thought of writing one anyway, but it'd probably be in VisualWorks, 
so it'd not be very helpful for the general Mac community.

What a great idea!  Every Internet protocol should have a NOOP command.
Seriously, this is a bug in the NNTP protocol.

We *did* have timeout problems before this NOOP pinging was put in.  I 
think that I used to have a HELP command, and I got complaints that the 
entire help transcript was being logged (so the NOOP was an improvement).

As far as servers which obsessively log commands sent to them, and the
consequent loss of disk space -- are you aware that you have given every
cracker on the Internet instructions of how to hit you with a denial of
service attack? 

It's important that any logging which you have installed is careful not to
allow randoms to fill up your disk.  In particular, for non-authenticated
connections, you should be *very* restricted in what events you log.  If
you log authentication failures, you need to have a throttle in order to
limit the number of such events that can happen in a particular interval.

Mark,

I usually find your response to be reasonable and well thought out.  In 
this case I am in doubt.  It seems to me that there are two issues and I 
am not clear about what you are saying about them.

The first is a protocol issue.  Nntp has a well defined protocol 
specified in an RFC.  To complicate this, there are proposed extensions 
and refinements which are not yet in the form of an RFC.  But Rich Salz 
is one of the folks deeply involved in this revision.  So the question is 
whether the NOOP is a part of the protocol (or is likely to be in the 
extensions).  If the answer is no then Pine should not generate the NOOPs.

This is as broader issue than just nntp.  In other areas the pine crew 
make quite a point of following the standards and reject lots of 
suggestions on that basis. In this I believe they are correct.

The second issue is whether client designers know in the abstract what 
timeout behaviour should be better than the folks who are running the 
servers.  I tend to think that the server operators know better in the 
specific cases and should adjust the timeouts if there are serious problems.

Dunno ! Has anyone informations on that ?

It's in the pine 3.91 package, under the c-client directory, here's is 
some piece of it :

I am using the Unix Pine 3.89 as the shell for dial in users.  My hope is
that users can only get/send email or netnews.  I like Pine a lot, it is
really good for new users (all we have here in Anguilla). I have some 
questions. 

First, about security.  I don't want users to be able to get out of Pine. 
Are there any recommended settings to tighten up security?  How tight can
it get?  I think I don't want them to be able to read or write files on 
the Unix machine except for their folders.  

I noticed the "-r" restricted flag.  This is kind of what I am after, but
I want the users to still have folders and be able to send mail. I may
just modify that a bit. 

Second, is there a PC-Pine for PCs that dial into a Unix system?  I have not 
used the PC-Pine, but it looks like it is for PCs on a network.  Do I have 
to use SLIP or UUPC on all the PCs?  Is there other software that runs on 
PCs so users can write and read mail offline so they don't need to stay 
connected to my machine so long?  (Cable and Wireless is very slow about 
getting me more phone lines - nearly 3 months now.)

Thanks,

   -- Vince

Greetings,
   Can I get instructions for decompressing, compiling, and installing 
pine on a Pyramid OSx system?  I realise this may be a tall order, but 
I'm starting from scratch here, and just trying to get a usable mail 
program running (the one we have now is horrible!).
   Thank you.

Oh yes.  Our solution (which we haven't implemented yet) is to make the 
Wyse60's ansi.  On our system you would set the TERM variable to 
wyse60ak and do a tset.  It doesn't fix everything (PgUp and PgDn don't 
work for instance) but it's a start.

Be careful!  If your other packages are expecting non-ansi keyboards 
you'll need to undo what you did above.  Also, if you flip from session 
to session, you may wind up with the wrong keyboard in the wrong program.

Some day we will make all our programs talk ansi, but for now I just use 
the control keys.  Other people have mini-scripts that take them into and 
out of ansi as they go in and out of pine, but watch out for task switching!

Hi,
I have read the fact sheet by Richard Shima at Cleveland Freenet and 
gather that it is not easy to make French accents print out. However has 
anyone made them print in unix-aix-pine(Korn shell). I have posted 
several messages to francophones and have received a suggestion to try to 
get some free Eudora software. Suggestions from anyone working on the 
same type of system are most welcome. We use character based 
workstations, not windows at the moment.
Appended is a message containing other info someone sent me for c shell. 
Could this be made to work in k shell and if so how?

Hi,

How do I setup the Pine configuration so when I post something, my
.signature file appends at the bottom?

Please reply me. Thanks.

I would be interested in corresponding with anyone who has managed to
get PC-PINE 3.91 working with PC-NFS 5.1 (DOS 6.00). I'd like to
know how you did it!

Rather than going into a lot of detail here, suffice it to say that
pine cannot find the inbox (it gives "[Host not found: xxxxx]"). I
can connect to the host just fine from all other applications, and
can successfully connect to the IMAP server ("telnet xxxx 143").
Pine: no go.

Hi folks-

Just have one question concerning EWAN telnet for Winsock, and PINE. A 
user tried to print an e-mail message from his account (which uses pine), 
through EWAN Telnet, a Winsock App.  However, the print job didn't go 
through.  Instead, EWAN or PINE erased the e-mail message.  Does anyone 
have any insight concerning this problem? If so, I would really 
appreciate a response.  TIA!

I need to type lines longer than 72 columns but somehow PICO/PINE keeps
wrapping the lines after, say, 72 columns. Is there anyway to turn off
that feature of auto-wrapping? Or is there anyway to set the right margin
beyond 72 columns?
 
The reason I need to go beyond 72 columns is that I'm sending commands to
a listserver which somehow does not recognize the usual continuation
characters &. At the moment, I use VI to prepare the files and then send
them off either by ELM or MAIL. Othertimes, I use PINE to read my usual
mails. A little bit cumbersome!

I'm trying to resolve a printing problem for a friend using
Qmodem V4.5 as his PC communications software. It appears
that Qmodem does not understand the ansi escape sequences
for printing which are sent by PINE when invoking the "Y"
(attached-to-ansi print) function.

Since I use TELIX, I'm not that familiar with Qmodem. Does
anyone know if it's possible to configure Qmodem to recognize
these ansi escape sequences. If it can't be done then I'll
get him to switch to TELIX but I'm trying to save him the
agony of beginning yet another learning curve.

Many thanks in advance.

visit are not networked.  Using a laptop and LCD Projector, I can run a
powerpoint slide show and then demo PCPINE (which looks almost identical
to pine under unix) except that I can't seem to compose due to the
fact that it looks for an imap server.  Is there any way to fake it so
that it thinks I can compose?  (I really don't want to send anything -
just show students how pine works.)

Any help will be appreciated!

if you are using pine 3.91 just create a file called .signature in 
you home directory

I have the same problem running PC-Pine Win through a PPP dialup.  After an 
extended edit or compose, when I attempt to send, Pine comes back with an 
error message "IMAP Connection Went Away".

Only workaround I've come up with is to let Pine time out until the 
"Break connection?" prompt, break the connnection, postpone the message, 
then quit and restart Pine.

Sorry I don't have an answer for you.  My service provider is no help, and a 
previous post here yielded no suggestions.

Anyone have any ideas to resolve the connection timeout problem?

Roland

Are either of you using an alternate-editor?

When an alternate editor is active, Pine is asleep and unable to "ping"
the IMAP server to prevent the server timeout.  This is a problem, but so
far we don't have a good solution for it.

Subject: procmail problems! ARGH!
Newsgroups: comp.mail.pine
Summary: 
Keywords: 
X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.2 PL0]

I am trying to set up procmail so that I can sort mail according to 
mailing list, etc. I am having tons of problems. My machine in a 
SPARCserver 10 running SunOS. My .forward file is:

"|/home/ma/csgrad1/treed/bin/procmail treed"

And my .procmailrc file is:

PATH=/home/ma/csgrad1/treed/bin
MAILDIR=$HOME/mail      #you'd better make sure it exists
DEFAULT=$MAILDIR/mbox   #completely optional
LOGFILE=$MAILDIR/from   #recommended

:0:
* ^From.*treed@rohan.sdsu.edu
from_me

:0
* ^Subject:.*Flame
/dev/null

I grabbed this example out of the man pages for procmail. It should put 
all messages from me into the folder from_me. I am pretty sure the 
forward is working because mail would not get through before, then I 
checked the forward man page and got the correct syntax for SunOS. Now I 
think the problem must be in the .procmailrc file. It isn't sorting 
anything, just dropping it straight through to the default inbox folder. 
I have tried tons of combinations and other procmailrc files from the 
mail filtering faq and procmail docs. None seem to work. :( Any suggestions?

No, that can't be the problem.  Some non-reply messages addressed to me 
get the "+" flag, others don't.

That can't be it.  I get mail addressed to:

  Francis Old <fold@mail.bcpl.lib.md.us>
  Francis E. Old <fold@mail.bcpl.lib.md.us>
  Chip Old <fold@mail.bcpl.lib.md.us>
  Francis "Chip" Old <fold@mail.bcpl.lib.md.us>
  <fold@mail.bcpl.lib.md.us>
 
The only one that _never_ sets the "+" flag is the one beginning with 
Francis "Chip" Old.  The others sometimes set it, sometimes not.

Are you sure you don't have that backwards?  Mail addressed to
egreshko@cosmo.twntpe.cdc.com forwarded to Ed.Greshko@cdc.com should show
up in your Inbox on cdc.com still addressed to
egreshko@cosmo.twntpe.cdc.com, so it shouldn't set the "+" flag.  Mail
addressed directly to Ed.Greshko@cdc.com should show up on cdc.com with
the "+" flag. 
 
That's how it works for me, at least.

You need to have a # in front of your username, otherwise 'treed' is 
treated like an argument for frocmail (which doesn't exist):

"|/home/ma/csgrad1/treed/bin/procmail #treed"

On the system I'm on this syntax works fine:

"|IFS=' ' && exec /home/ma/csgrad1/bin/procmail -f- || exit 75 #treed"

hth,

I just ftp'd pine3.91, and I see the "build" file will compile pine for
ultrix, next, sun, ptx, and a32, but no mention of AUX.  Is anyone running
pine on A/UX 3.0 or later?

In contrib/aux.port I found aux.diff, and the README says:

This is a first cut at a port of Pine to A/UX 3.0 by Marcelo Gallardo
<marcelo@deadzone.Princeton.EDU>.  This port arrived too late to be merged into
the Pine 3.85 release, but is expected to be included in a future release.

Does anyone know if these changes were included in pine 3.91?  If not, can
anyone tell me how to use aux.diff?

[ Article crossposted from crl.general ]

[ Posted on 3 Feb 1995 09:40:25 -0800 ]

I have having a frustrating problem inPine.

If I have two message that come in and I want to edit them into
one message, I try to forward the first one to myself, then cut some 
stuff out.  I then forward the second message to myself and try to
paste the first message into the second.  NOthing happens.

Control ^ works just find.
Control K  cuts just as it's supposed.
Control U  will repaste INSIDE any message, but will not
		repaste into a new message.

Somewhere I read that perhaps esc  esc  U  would do it.  NOpe.

Is it impossible to cut and paste from message to message or am
I doing something wrong?

Please help.

Thanks,   Bob Corbett

This is currently not avail. however what i would do is (E)xport the mail to
$HOME and then download it from there to local machine either by using 'ftp'
if you are on ethernet or if you are dialing in, then any serial xfer protocol
aware s/w like kermit, sz, procomm or something similar. Hope this helps.

 +  	But what about when you want to reply to a mail from a mailing
 +  list but reply only to the sender (not to the entire list)?... 

Keeping up with this thread, here's a situation i usually encounter.
A user sends an e-mail to a person, Cc's to the mailing list and then sets the
Reply-To to go to the list.

So when i reply, it prompts me first for do you want to use Reply To: instead
of From, I say yes and now since the original poster had Cc'd to the list
it prompts me again for Do you want to reply to all the recipients.

I'm using the Reply-To: so the reply will go to the list, so it includes every
one so where is the question of 'all reciepients' unless ofcourse if the
original poster had Cc'd to someone else who is not on the list.

: Pine insists on asking "Do you want to reply to 
: Reply-to:" as that is what reply-to is for, and it is bad manners to 
: reply anywhere else.

         The "Reply to:" usually means that you have received the
         email from a mailing list. The choice is do you wish to
         reply to everyone on the mailing list or only the 
         author.            

         Pine gives you the choice. If your email continues the 
         discussion everyone is interewsted. However you also 
         have the choice of sending something to the author only.
       
         
: I also understand that this may well be a contentious issue, so what I am 
: asking for is a config option "Always use Reply-to in reply".

         Yes, such a config option would be good.

	This may be a silly idea, but I reckon it would be nice to be able to
set the character set independently for composing messages and for viewing
them. I say this because a few people in the US have been complaining at me
for accidentally hitting Shift-3 when I should have used the 'proper' hash
key, thus getting =20's and all those other things scattered throughout my
mail. But! when viewing messages, it would be nice to be able to set the
character set to ISO-8859-1, as I can view these character sets (plus I
wouldn't get that message about some characters maybe being displayed
incorrectly). 

	Just my Thought For The Day. :)

Hello PINErs --

I just compiled PINE3.91 on a DEC Alpha 3300 running OSF.  I thought I 
had read/heard somewhere that 3.91 could also be used as a POP mail 
server. I do already have pop3d on this same alpha.  Is it true?  If so, 
what needs to be done?

Thanks!

There are many languages in the world with which people communicate.

The ASCII symbols available to PINE do not include all the characters 
needed for most languages that are not English.

There are conversion filters that will allow the messages to be 
converted to the available ASCII characters for sending and receiving but 
allowing writing and reading to be done in the desired language.

I am hoping to hear about anyones experiences using such filters/converters,
especially anyone who has tried or succeeded in attaching them to PINE so 
that the process is automatic. (That is to say not requiring; write the 
text, convert it, send it, receive it, export to a file, read it).

The language I am using is Latvian but the principles should be the same 
for any non English language.

Thank you

We have replaced the local delivery agent (binmail) with
procmail as described in the Install instructions on the same
type machine running same OS and it works flawlessly (with
sendmail8.6.9). Perhaps not what you wanted to hear, just letting
you know that it does work.

	When I speak of the email address I speak of that within the
seperators < and >.  The LHS is to the left of "@" the RHS is to the
right of "@".  In all of the case you mention above, they are all equal.

	I didn't say that the mail was address as egreshko@cosmo.twntpe.cdc.com
and then forwarded to Ed.Greshko@cdc.com.  I'm telling you that my email
address is also Ed.Greshko@cdc.com and I can be addressed directly in
that fashion.  Thru the magic of X.500 directory services the email will
be delivered just fine.  I'm telling you the mail showing up in my mailbox
address to Ed.Greshko@cdc.com will *not* have the "+" set...but mail
address to egreshko@cosmo.twntpe.cdc.com or egreshko@hobbes.twntpe.cdc.com
or even egreshko@twntpe.cdc.com will arrive with the "+".  

	When dealing with email systems, don't forget that what is on the
headers may not be what is on the envelope.

Comes here Mr. Bob Corbett with this opinion in the "comp.mail.pine" group in
this article on 3 Feb 1995 11:50:15 -0800:

 +  Is it impossible to cut and paste from message to message or am
 +  I doing something wrong?

This feature currently is not avail. However what I would do is (E)xport the
first mail into $HOME and then read that file in while responding to the second.

Hope this helps.

Hi everyone,

	I recently compiled and intsalled pine 3.91 under FreeBSD un*x.  
Anyways, where is the pine.conf file supposed to be for the system 
defaults?  I have mines in /usr/local/lib but when I do pine -conf
it is showing a different configuration than what's there in /usr/local/lib.
Does anyone know how do I fix this?   Thanks in advance!

Could've sworn I read this and replied several days ago.  Do we have a 
dup loop going?
 
We had the same problem here.  Based on what youre getting from your
cursor keys, it sounds like your Wyse terminals are set for Wyse 50+
terminal emulation.  Pine will work better for you if you reset them to
vt100 emulation.  It's easy enough to do, but youi need to switch back
after your Pine session if you need Wyse emulation for other functions.

Most current Mac telecomm software has an option to set some other key 
(usually the Command or Option key) to act as the Control key on older 
Macs that don't have real Control keys.

Yes, it's a terminal emulation problem.  Some telecomm softare, 
regardless of platform, just doesn't emulate vt100 or vt102 as completely 
as it should.  If a normal control character doesn't work for you, 
substitute two escapes for the control key.  In other words, instead of 
Control-^, use Esc Esc ^.
 
For what it's worth, the best vt102 emulation currently available in Mac
telecomm software is provided by Microphone Pro.  It's pretty pricey, but
you can do almost anything with it.  VersaTerm Pro is also supposed to be
very good, but Ive never used it.  If money is a problem, I recommend the
$30 shareware Zterm (although it doesn't handle vt100/102 print commands
properly, so Pine's "y" print command prints to screen instead of to the
local printer).

Hi everyone,

	I recently compiled and intsalled pine 3.91 under FreeBSD un*x.  
Anyways, where is the pine.conf file supposed to be for the system 
defaults?  I have mines in /usr/local/lib but when I do pine -conf
it is showing a different configuration than what's there in /usr/local/lib.
Does anyone know how do I fix this?   Thanks in advance!


                              Cheers,

Hi Terry, thanks for the response.  No altenate editor.  I'm using the

I may be wrong, but I think that the "print-to-attched-printer" only 
works under vt100 style emulation.  

I use TeleMate myself, and it works perfectly when I use VT-102 
emulation.  Just hit "Y" and out comes my e-mail on my dot matrix. :)

Good luck.

Probably the two most common ways ways are:

1> To save the message WITH header infomation use the <E>xport command.

2> To save the message WITHOUT header info use <V>iew attachment

Unfortunately, these two statements conflict with each other.  You can not
build a proper functional NNTP client or server using the specification in
RFC-977.  Consider the following differences from RFC-977:

1) You are supposed to use LIST ACTIVE to get the list of active 
   newsgroups.  RFC-977 only defines LIST with no argument; there are
   reports of NNTP servers which reject this.

2) The only way to find out which message numbers are valid in a sequence
   is by the LISTGROUP command (absent in RFC-977) or, failing that, by
   the "XHDR Date" command (also absent in RFC-977).  RFC-977 requires
   you to have holes in your browser -- something that *infuriated* users
   of earlier versions of Pine who tried to use the news support.

3) Many NNTP servers do not permit posting without your having first given
   the AUTHINFO USER and AUTHINFO PASS commands (absent in RFC-977).  [I
   wonder if the paranoid site administrators who worry about people 
   posting forged news messages realize that this "fix" broadcasts 
   passwords in the clear over the net!].

   Pine does not implement this yet, and we're getting beaten up about 
   it. 

4) Many NNTP clients have been changed to take advantage of the XOVER
   command (absent in RFC-977), which permits fetching of sufficient
   information of a message to build a browser line; and what's more,
   permits it over a range of messages.

   Pine does not implement this yes, and we're getting beaten up about
   it.  Right now, Pine laboriously fetches the headers for each message,
   one at a time, and does an RFC-822 parse to build the browser line.
   This is slow.

5) NNTP is conspicuously the *only* protocol that lacks a no-op command.
   Fortunately, unlike POP2, unknown command errors do not cause the
   connection to die, so a client can issue a NOOP command and ignore
   any error in the server's response.

The only rational conclusion that one must make is that there is no such
thing as a standard NNTP protocol.  Rather, each client and server
implementor is on his own to build something that more or less
interoperates with the maximal number of other implementation. 

Yes, this is a lousy circumstance.  But this is the condition that NNTP 
is in.  It is not possible to develop a viable NNTP implementation using 
the published specification.

Given that other NNTP server and client implementors have had no problem
with the concept of making undocumented commands mandatory, I see no
inconsistancy in doing the same thing in Pine.  More importantly, however,
is the fact that there was no choice.  It wasn't just that people were
beating up on us about the lack of NNTP server pinging -- we were being
screwed by it ourselves! 

> But Rich Salz 
> is one of the folks deeply involved in this revision.

Unfortunately, nothing has come out of Salz's efforts.  Even worse, it
seems that the NNTP community seems to have fractured, and there is no
guarantee that anything Salz eventually produces will be accepted.  Which
is a shame, since in general Salz seems to have the right ideas. 

Consider the recent debate about the function of the Newsgroups: header
line, and the emergence of cretins who insist that headers must be
interpreted in a context-sensitive fashion between news/mail.  I don't 
think there is any hope of seeing a viable NNTP standard specification 
until this matter is resolved (and there is little hope of the result 
being accepted if the cretins win).

As I pointed out earlier, the NOOPs are harmless.  Or rather, they should
be.  NOOP is an unknown command in a strict interpretation of RFC-977. 
The specification is quite clear about the treatment of unknown commands.
So, in that regard, NOOP -- or rather, the correct server behavior to a 
NOOP command -- is part of the protocol.

I am sorry about the log file garbage that some server maintainers have as
a result.  However, part of the process of gathering logging information
is identifying what information is significant, and filtering out the
unimportant information.  Logs with excessive noise are just as bad as 
inadequate logs.

More importantly, stating that "NOOP log events are filling up my disk" 
is an open broadcast to all crackers about how to commence a denial of
service attack on your system.  The security implications are worse than
just denial of service to users.  A cracker could cause denial of service
to security logging mechanisms.  Just send a few hundred thousand bogus
commands at the NNTP server until the disk fills, then crack away without
fear of having evidence against you being logged. 

Furthermore, it is fairly common in older Internet protocols for clients
to probe for server capabilities by attempting commands which the server
may or may not know.  Newer Internet protocols provide a capability
listing mechanism which allegedly makes this unnecessary (and, as I
expected, we're already seeing skews between advertised capabilities and
implemented ones). 

The bottom line is that client behavior (especially non-authenticated
clients such as NNTP clients) that causes excessive resource consumption
on a server identifies a server problem, not a client problem.

I'm confident that if I changed the NOOP to a HELP (which is in RFC-977), 
I'll get complaints from server maintainers of their logs being filled up 
with help texts.  [I know, because that's what I used to do.]

In the case of NNTP, there simply is no standard that one can use to 
develop a viable implementation.  There are *no* NNTP implementations 
which conform strictly to RFC-977.

NNTP sticks out like a sore thumb in this regard.

The Pine team has historically come rather firmly on the side of the 
client controlling all aspects of the user interface.  How long you are 
permitted to be idle is an aspect of the user interface.

Judging from the number of vehement complaints in this newsgroup from
people who have had IMAP connections dropped due to a failure in Pine's
timeout suppression mechanism (and yes, we *are* working to nail these!),
it seems that the user community is on Pine's side on this issue.

PCPine for Windows would be a perfect add-on for my Windows bases host.
The host software is 100% Windows and has the ablity to make calls to
DLL files. The host software can already import QWK and make a mail/news
run using WINNETs' Terminal application, then it does a conversion and auto-
matically imports the e-mail/newsgroups into the forums-messagebases, that's
pretty cool, but I think a PCPine-Win DLL would be great. There is a frame
work of sample source code to build on. It's available in TPascal and C.

I like using PCPine-Win and Unix and would like to allow my dial-up users
to also use it.

Mark,

You have made things a bit clearer.  Please note that I was not among 
those that complaines about what ends up in log files.  I know how to 
manage my logfiles so that isn't a problem.  I do like to understand 
things that show up there.

I knew that the revisions of the nntp protocol document was long delayed. 
I did not realize that things had deteriorated to the state that you 
describe.

The reason that I mentioned Salz at all was that the complaint seemed to 
be one about the interoperation of Pine and INN.  I expect INN to reflect 
his thinking and that of the others who I knew were working on the 
revision of the protocol.

I don't have a lot of sympathy with those folks who go out to write the 
world's latest and greatest news reader and do it without regard to 
interoperability and protocol considerations.  (And I don't include the 
Pine team in that group, so don't take this as a criticism of your work.)

I guess that I would come down on the side of using HELP instead of NOOP 
provided using it would not generate unexpected output for the client to 
deal with.  But it is a matter of taste.

It may be that a large part of the problem is that the transport and 
reading are contained in the same protocol.  Separating the two might get 
us standards for both sooner.

On the matter of the timeout, I just disagree about who is best to judge.
The server is in the best position to manage the use of its resources. 
one should not undermine that management by non-standard behaviour of the 
client.  Perhaps the protocol should allow the negotiation of the timeout 
between client and server (back to the subject of point one).  In the 
case where the client and server are under the same administrative 
control you should be able to deal with this problem by modifying the 
server.  That ought to be the case at U. of Wn. where your most important 
user base is.

Hi everyone,

	I recently compiled and intsalled pine 3.91 under FreeBSD un*x.  
Anyways, where is the pine.conf file supposed to be for the system

it is showing a different configuration than what's there in /usr/local/lib.
Does anyone know how do I fix this?   Thanks in advance!

HI,

I know most of these exist out there but I am wondering where the 
locations are. 

I have heard of PINE for X (Specifically for Solaris 2.3) as well as NeXT 
(intel hardware) and am wondering if that was idle chatter or if they exist.

If they do exist might someone point me in the right direction to locate 
them.

Too: Part of this is attempting to have a consistant program distribution 
over our netowrk (heaven knows that the OS's and boxes aren't). I have 
PC-Pine setup all over the place and standard pine humming along in the 
terminal windows of the Suns and NeXT. What I don't have is Pine working 
for the command-line impared or our two FreeBSD 2.0 training boxes. (I 
haven't managed to sucessfully compile it)

<GASP> So, if anyone can pass along any pointers for FreeBSD compilation 
or locals of roden-based pines I would greatly appreciate it!

Decent full-function editors for UNIX (I only use jove, Emacs, and jed)
allow you to mark a region and send it to a UNIX filter, in this case sort.
Read the manpage for your editor and for sort.  I believe joe and vi also
allow piping a region to an external command.  Basically if you can imagine
a text tranformation, the basic tools of UNIX can accomplish it.  Get a good
intro book to UNIX.

The problem is a classic one of not having a normalized datafile.  On UNIX
you could at least give some consideration to treating this as a
bibliography and using the bib tools.  To see addbib and his friends, 
'man -k bib'

People have given you some pointers.  Go check out the books on awk and perl
from your library.

Subject: Unix INBOX
Status: O
X-Status: 

On Unix, the receiving system mailbox is located at

   /var/spool/mail/<userid>

and Unix Pine calls this folder INBOX. On Unix (or
maybe specific to Sun workstation's 'mailtool'), there
is a default mailbox called 'inbox' which is a local
folder in which to move the email.

Within Pine, every mail folder is case-sensitive except
for the INBOX folder. This makes it impossible to move
my email from the system folder to my local 'inbox'
folder.

For clarification: at work I use Sun workstations which
use the X-Window 'mailtool'. When I work from home using
the PC to dial in, I use Pine.

Is there any way that Pine can switch from a case-insensitive
INBOX to something else (maybe even something that the user
can set in the configuration file)?

Subject: Subdirectories With Pine?

	Is there a way to configure Pine so that 
I am able to use subdirectories within either my 
mail or "Subscribed-Groups" directories?  What I 
would like to do, is to configure my newsgroups 
directory so that I can have all of the groups 
which are related to a given topic in a separate 
subdirectory.  Also, I would like to set up my 
mail directory so that I have one or two separate 
subdirectories for people with whom I regularly 
exchange E-Mail, so that I can keep each of them 
as a separate folder without cluttering up my 
primary mail directory with folders.  Also, I am 
learning that it may be useful to have a separate 
"Lists" folder for storing mail from the various 
mailing lists that I am on.  Is anything like 
this possible?

Each folder in the list may have an optional nickname in front of it, and 
if it exists, that nickname will be used in the display.  The nickname is 
separated from the rest of the name by a space.

These questions *weren't* in the FAQ!

Does anyone have any nice sed, awk or perl scripts to convert 
.addressbook format  *TO* Berkeley .mailrc alias format?  This is so my 
automated mailing can use my pine addresses.

Also, does anyone have scripts for converting mh mailing aliases to pine 
.addressbook format?

I asked this on just the newsgroup but got no reply.

TIA,

Hello... if anybody knows how to do the following, please tell me; 
otherwise these are suggestions for the next version.

1.  The folder list should display the number of messages in a newsgroup 
(so I don't have to enter the newsgroup only to discover it empty!).  
Alternatively one might turn off display of empty groups.

2.  It should be possible to set up a hierarchy of folders so I can sort 
newsgroups by subject.  (STRN does this... maybe rn and trn too?)

3.  Undelete newsgroup messages.

Thanks for any help, or for taking suggestions!  (There are Pine 
programmers watching this group, right?)

-David

P.S.  I'm using Unix Pine 3.91.

Hi all.  I have a list which I use to mail to multiple reciepients.  The only
problem is that the Cc: can get so long that people simply just skim or just
ignore the messages completetly.  Is there any way to suppress the Cc: list in
pine so that it doesn't show up in any of the reciepients' mail?  I'm
use pine v3.91, btw.

Any help is appreciated.

The answer is no, you can't.  The definition of INBOX actually comes from 
IMAP, and is specifically case-insensitive.

However, you can access a file named inbox, by prefixing it with some 
sort of directory specifier, e.g. ~/inbox, ~/mail/inbox, etc.

I've done some modifications to pine so that users of a BBS can use it
as their mailer.  Involved removing features that may let them look at
arbitrary files or execute arbitrary programs, and adding upload and
download commands so they can read or save file on their local computer.

If there is interest I'll see if the BBS folks will let me release the 
secure version.  Maybe they will, maybe they won't.  Even if I can, people
who pick it up will probably have to modify it a little to fit their own
environment.  I use some functions that are propritary to the BBS.  Plus,
every's idea of what is secure is a little different.

You can use pc-pine with dialup IP (SLIP or PPP).  But it's not very
good about offline mail reading.  I think that Pegasus mail provides
good offline reading, but it's a POP mail client.

Hello all,

auto-move-read-msgs works well when connected to the local INBOX.
However, when connected to a remote INBOX via IMAP I have no luck.
Is it possible to configure pine to also auto-move these messages.

Thanks

Go into Setup/Config and set the "signature-at-bottom" feature.
Alternatively you can edit the the .pinerc file and add "signature-at-bottom"
to the feature-list entry.

I just configured pine to be used as a newsreader and was amazed at how 
fast it got me to the actual newsgroups.  What I need to know is how to 
get pine, if it can, to list how many entrees are listed in each 
newsgroup.  Tin does this so I know when to go into a newsgroup and when 
not to (nothing there).  Can pine do the same.

Thanks, Don.

Yes,it is easy.  In the To: write your own address.  Then, while up
at the top hit   control R.  YOu will get the expanded heading.
This will cause you to get more of a heading and it will include
bcc (blind carbon copy).  On this line type the name of your
mailing list.  Then, even though the whole list is on that letter,
your recipients will only get a letter addressed to themself.

I have a mailing list.  It was quite easy.  Once in my mailing list I 
believe Ihit z.  Check the list at the bottom.  It asked me to name the
list, which I did as ptp.  Then it asked for addresses (not names.  Mine
won't let me put names on addresses).

Then when I want to mail I merely hit ptp on the send line, at least that
is what I did early on.  Then my list got up to over 100 people and all
those addresses took up 3 pages.

So, now when I get ready to mail I mail it to ME.  Then I hit
Conrol R and I get an expanded heading, including a line
bcc (blind carbon copy).  Next I type my ptp on this line and now
the letter goes out with only one person's name, their own, on each
of the 100+ letters.

Hope this helps,   bob Corbett

If it is not clear, write back, I'll try again.

(I suppose you meant POP *client*.)

>From the 6 januari FAQ:

    Subject: Can PC-Pine be used with a POP server?

    No. Neither Pine nor PC-Pine currently support POP's offline
    mail model (wherein pending mail is pulled from the mail server
    to the local machine and deleted from the server).  However, it
    is likely that this model will be supported, with a choice of
    either IMAP or POP as the access protocol, in a future release.

Implementation/technical question to the Pine team:

On our Unix site we would like to use POP (with Kerberos
support, "kpop") just as a safer method of fetching
/usr/spool/mail/$USER contents to $HOME/mbox than using
NFS. We have a program which can do this kpop fetch.

How difficult would it be (for you or us) to change Pine to run
this program for the mbox-fetch rather than opening and copying
it itself? Hmm, a change in the c-client mbox.c file (we use
mbox driver as default), function mbox_ping() seems to be
needed, right?

X-Status: 

I really get irritated by the lack of a SHELL facility in the PINE
message editor. At least if I could POSTPONE the composition and
then SHELL from the menu without leaving PINE completely, that
would suffice. But it would be ideal to have it in the editor itself.

I tried to switch to using ELM for a while, but gave up, since it
doesn't have a COMPOSE command. I suppose I'm expected to use
EMACS with the appropriate macros, but I don't want to travel
down that road again, so I use PICO (it looks a lot like the
editor built into PINE, probably due to the common authorship).

Does PINE have a SHELL command? Am I missing it? Send replies via
email, please.

Hiya folks....

Was wondering if anyone has messed with this at all.

Pine is a pretty big boy to run.
I've got a Sun Sparc2k, and frequently have 200+ people on.

Has anyone played with Shared-configurations of pine under Solaris 2.x?

I thought that maybe unbundling pico from pine would help.
(since pico would only be called if someone is composing and not when 
someone is reading).

I guess I'm looking for ideas on cutting down on memory usuage...


Thanks for any clues... (I know..... buy more memory :-)

I've asked the same question some time ago with no result. The problem is
that none of the install script that come with Pine are working with BSD
4.4 g and it seams nobody has done the port yet. Some guys here who are a
lot better than me in Unix we'll do the required modifications as soon as
they resolved our more pressing problems (with FreeBSD 2.0R, the DNS stop
and the server reboot for no reason).

I'll post as soon as I have a workable solution. If you find a way before
that, please post here or contact me.

As I said, I think that Salz has the right ideas.  The problem is that I've
seen certain other individuals in the NNTP community challenge him on other
matters (specifically, the role of message headers in news), and what's worse,
by his own admission the NNTP document update effort has stalled.

It's a shame, but given what I've seen, I can understand the burnout.

The other idea is to use DATE -- a nice sort-of no-op in INN.  Unfortunately,
DATE is also absent from RFC-977.  I'd rather explain to people what the
unrecognized NOOPs do than what the unrecognized DATEs do!  ;-)

It depends upon what you consider the role of timeouts to be.  If you see them
as a safety belt to allow the garbage collection of abandoned collections,
then it is not only reasonable, it is *mandatory*, that the client reassure
the server that it is still there at periodic intervals.

Perhaps, but technically, timeouts are a violation of the TCP spec!  TCP is
rather emphatic about this.  During a nuclear war, you do not want Clinton's
telnet session to nuker.af.mil to be dropped just because a section of network
in Ohio evaporated and it took a few minutes before another 747 with a cisco
and microwave transceiver could be sent up to replace the lost line.

As I said, timeouts have a useful purpose in an LAN configuration with
machines such as PCs and Macs which are not completely careful about notifying
the other end (via TCP reset) when their applications go away (worse, they
tend to use the same port numbers, and get screwed if the connection is still
there at the server).  We're not really worried about keeping our NNTP service
available during nuclear war.  ;-)  But, we want to have abandoned servers
from PC/Mac clients go away fairly aggressively (for reasons outlined above)
without impacting live clients.  This leads us naturally to short timeouts and
keepalive pings.

This is a problem I also ran into when using WINDOWS TERMINAL to attempt to
send ^C and arrow key commands to our machine.  My solution was to toggle
the parameter:  Settings/Terminal Preferences/"Use Function, Arrow, and Ctrl
Keys for Windows" from its default of "X" to no-"X" in the dialog box.  This
apparently keeps TERMINAL from intercepting these keystrokes and allows them
to pass to the modem.

We use the Firstname.Lastname -type aliases a lot, so our users asked if
they could get pine to recognize those aliases too. This alias thing
should probably be a configurable option, but I solved it by modifying
the source to use the PERSONAL_NAME variable. It's usually set
automatically from the gecos field, but can be set from the pinerc too.

So, if you set the PERSONAL_NAME to Ed Greshko, this patch gets pine 
to recognize e-mail sent to Ed.Greshko@cdc.com and tag them with '+'.

Note that since the RHS isn't checked at all, this can have surprise
effects with, for example, John.Smiths of the world.

The current version of Pine (3.91) doesn't show you how many articles are 
present in a newsgroup.  No indication has been given (that I recall) 
whether this may be included in a future release; but certainly it gets 
asked for on and off!

The easiest thing for you to do is press the TAB key.

TAB normally moves you to the next New (unread) message/article.  When 
reading news if there are no more articles in the current newsgroup it 
will search on through your list of subscribed groups looking for one 
that contains articles.  If no more newsgroups with articles are found it 
offers to return you to the INBOX.

It may be that the same behaviour applies to mail folders (probably does, 
knowing the Pine Team's wonderful consistency) but I tend to only use TAB 
in anger when reading News so haven't noticed.  I seem to recall there 
may be some options in the Setup Configuration screen too worth looking at.

As I said, I think that Salz has the right ideas.  The problem is that I've
seen certain other individuals in the NNTP community challenge him on other
matters (specifically, the role of message headers in news), and what's worse,
by his own admission the NNTP document update effort has stalled.

It's a shame, but given what I've seen, I can understand the burnout.

The other idea is to use DATE -- a nice sort-of no-op in INN.  Unfortunately,
DATE is also absent from RFC-977.  I'd rather explain to people what the
unrecognized NOOPs do than what the unrecognized DATEs do!  ;-)

It depends upon what you consider the role of timeouts to be.  If you see them
as a safety belt to allow the garbage collection of abandoned collections,
then it is not only reasonable, it is *mandatory*, that the client reassure
the server that it is still there at periodic intervals.

Perhaps, but technically, timeouts are a violation of the TCP spec!  TCP is
rather emphatic about this.  During a nuclear war, you do not want Clinton's
telnet session to nuker.af.mil to be dropped just because a section of network
in Ohio evaporated and it took a few minutes before another 747 with a cisco
and microwave transceiver could be sent up to replace the lost line.

As I said, timeouts have a useful purpose in an LAN configuration with
machines such as PCs and Macs which are not completely careful about notifying
the other end (via TCP reset) when their applications go away (worse, they
tend to use the same port numbers, and get screwed if the connection is still
there at the server).  We're not really worried about keeping our NNTP service
available during nuclear war.  ;-)  But, we want to have abandoned servers
from PC/Mac clients go away fairly aggressively (for reasons outlined above)
without impacting live clients.  This leads us naturally to short timeouts and
keepalive pings.

Hello,

	 I've been using pine since release 3.05 under ConvexOS. The product
	is REALLY NICE and fits to all kind of users ('beginners' and 'gurus')
	in the Convex French office. Now I try to port version 3.91. After the 
	'build cvx' completion, I got this message when exiting pine :

>   Copyright 1989-1994.  PINE is a trademark of the University of Washington.
>                           [Closing folder "INBOX". Keeping message]
>Y [Yes]
>N No
>Error resetting signals: No such file or directory

	Does it sound like a known problem to you ? I forgot to point out that
	I did comment two lines in c-client/osdep.h to avoid an error message
	concerning malloc/realloc during build :

>Making Pine.
>cc -tm c1 -DCVX   -cxdb -DDEBUG -DSYSTYPE=\"CVX\" -c addrbook.c
>cc: Error on line 49 of ./../c-client/osdep.h: 'malloc' redeclared: incompatible types.

>cc: Can't recover from previous errors
>*** Exit 1
>`pine' not built due to errors

	I compile successfully pine once these lines are commented.
	Many thanks in advance for your help, best regards.

Berkeley mail, if you will pardon the expression, has a provision for 
specifying a list of alternate names. It is used to remove the alternate 
names from the list of recipients when replying.  But, then, it didn't 
really have a feature like the personal mail flag so it couldn't use it 
for that purpose in any case.  Perhaps the Pine team could consider such 
a feature as a part of the configuration.

Bonjour

I have the following problem. I sent a similar question a few days ago 
and did not get any answer... 

If someone use the function "reply" to 
reply to one of my message he gets the following return adress: 
duhaimj%terre@terre.ircm.umontreal.ca instead of
duhaimj@ircm.umontreal.ca
Any idea of how to solve the problem?

Here are a few scripts to help solve the "arrow keys in pine on a Wyse 
terminal" problem.  Put them in your "bin" directory and then call 
"wpine" instead of "pine".  Your arrow keys and a few function keys 
(Prev/Next Page, Line/Char delete) will now work.

Beware: if you do multiple session stuff you may wind up with the wrong 
kind of keys in the wrong screen.

Call me if you have questions/suggestions.

Hi!  We're having trouble having Pine 3.91 reckon and use the printer 
specified in the system-wide configuration file.  We've set 
"standard-printer=lp" on a SunOS 4.1.3 test host and we get "lpr" for the 
standard print command.

Moreover, we have set "standard-printer=lpr" on a Solaris 2.3 production
host and we get "lp" for the standard print command.  This also happens on
an HP/UX V9.0 host.  However, this does not happen on an AIX 3.2.5 host. 

Any suggestions?  This is an important matter to us because we have a
customized "lpr." 

All replies will be much appreciated.

Problem:  Users are not properly logging off their accounts and pine 
processes are eating between 10 and 60 % of the CPU.

I spoke to a few users, and they turned off their PC while still logged 
on and in the pine program.

Is there anything we can do (besides educating our users) with these
runaway jobs.  If the user was not in pine, and turned off their PC
without logging off, the login shell goes away once the connection is 
gone.  But because they are in pine, the login shell does not go away 
(and neither does the pine).

   Is this a feature of pine? :-)

The headers on most messages from mailing lists (not this one,
unfortunately) include a "From:" field and a "Reply to:" field.  Depending
on the circumstances, it may be appropriate to reply to the whole list
(Reply to), or it may be appropriate to reply only to the original sender
(From).  Therefore it's appropriate that Pine gives you those options. 
Why do you want Pine to force you to always reply to the list rather than
to the individual?  Inquiring minds want to know...

This is an automated response to your Pine[*] bug report.  The purpose of
this message is to: 1) acknowledge receipt of your report, 2) apologize in
advance for the fact that you may not receive any other response to it, 3)
assure you that if it is a bug report or enhancement suggestion, we will
look at it carefully, and 4) tell you how to get more information or help.

Pine is now used by literally millions of people around the world, and
thousands more every day.  Not surprisingly, the number of messages sent
to our "pine-bugs" address has become enormous.  Since we receive no
funding to support anyone outside the University of Washington, it is no
longer possible to answer all of them individually.

Alternatives:

 o In addition to Pine's context-sensitive internal help text, also read
   the Release Notes (the R command on the Main Menu.)

 o Check out the Pine Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) list.  To get a
   copy by email, simply REPLY to this message, or send any message to:
        pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu

 o Check with your local support staff.  If you are not sure how to
   contact them, try sending a very polite note to "postmaster"
   on your system, asking that your inquiry be directed to the help desk.

 o If you can't get any help from your local support staff (or you
   *are* the local support staff), consider sending a message to the
   world-wide "pine-info" email list at:
         pine-info@cac.washington.edu
   or post to the comp.mail.pine newsgroup (pine-info and comp.mail.pine
   are linked together, so there is no need to both send email and post).
   Your message will be seen by thousands of Pine users and system
   administrators, one of whom may have just the information you seek.

 o If you are handy with FTP or WWW tools, you may find some useful 
   documentation on our Pine Information Center servers:
        ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine
        http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine

 o If you really, *really* need to get in touch with the Pine development
   team directly, send a message to:
         pine@cac.washington.edu

Note that we get many questions that are not actually about Pine. In case
your inquiry concerns programs such as talk, chat, or IRC, or problems
with disk space on your system, or with unknown/invalid email addresses,
please contact your local computer support staff.  However, we still
welcome actual bug reports and suggestions.

With sincere apologies for this impersonal response,

Hello,

	 I've been using pine since release 3.05 under ConvexOS. The product
	is REALLY NICE and fits to all kind of users ('beginners' and 'gurus')
	in the Convex French office. Now I try to port version 3.91. After the 
	'build cvx' completion, I got this message when exiting pine :

>   Copyright 1989-1994.  PINE is a trademark of the University of Washington.
>                           [Closing folder "INBOX". Keeping message]
>Y [Yes]
>N No
>Error resetting signals: No such file or directory

	Does it sound like a known problem to you ? I forgot to point out that
	I did comment two lines in c-client/osdep.h to avoid an error message
	concerning malloc/realloc during build :

>Making Pine.
>cc -tm c1 -DCVX   -cxdb -DDEBUG -DSYSTYPE=\"CVX\" -c addrbook.c
>cc: Error on line 49 of ./../c-client/osdep.h: 'malloc' redeclared: incompatible types.
>cc: Error on line 50 of ./../c-client/osdep.h: 'realloc' redeclared: incompatible types.
>cc: Can't recover from previous errors
>*** Exit 1
>`pine' not built due to errors

	I compile successfully pine once these lines are commented.
	Many thanks in advance for your help, best regards.

I have been trying to compile pine on a system running FreeBSD 2.0R,
but I wasn't successful in doing so.

I have tried both "build bsd" and "build bsi" with the same result.

If anyone managed to compile pine for this platform, could you send the
patches.

Thanks

Ilan

    I use Pine 3.91 on SunOs 4.1.1 via modem (vt100 -- COMit for Windows). 
Everything seems to work very well except for when I use Pico.  The
composer in Pine works normally -- control sequences and even the arrow
keys with the scroll lock on.  But in Pico, nothing seems to work right. 
No arrow keys and CTRL X is about the only control sequence that works.  I
know I can hit the ESC key twice in place of CTRL but why does everything
work in Pine but not in Pico?  I thought they were basically the same
thing.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Try the "sort" command. Read the online manual pages for it to see the

Subject: specifying viewer path in .mailcap? 


How to tell Pine (and Mosaic) where to find external viewer xv (and
others like mpeg, etc)???

Do I specify the viewer's (xv)path in the .mailcap file or in an
environment variable prior to invoking Pine (or Mosaic)?

Currently, I place xv in Pine's (AND Mosaic's) directory. I'm not
happy about the loss of hard disk space due to duplicate xv's in
different directories. 

Thanks in advance.

Actually, they can change this from their .pinerc file.  However, the 
system administrator can administratively prevent this.  All he/she 
needs to do is create a pine.conf.fixed file (in addition to the 
pine.conf file) and make the appropriate settings.

What the pine.conf.fixed file does is permanently fixes any settings you 
do not want your users changing.

Guess how we found this out?  Yep, our students were coming up with 
creative "from" names too.

Hope this helps

Hi folks!

I've figured out some nice tricks:

1)  Here is a csh alias to bring up PINE in its own window (put it in 
    your .cshrc):

     alias xpine "xterm -geometry 80x50+10+10 -n PINE -e /usr/local/bin/pine &"


2)  I also looked into the WWW site for pine, 

	http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine/

    and retrieved the little pine.xbm file that is in there.  I used 
    xbmtopbm and pbmtoicon to convert this to an icon file which I have 
    attached to this message ;).


However, I can't manage one last thing:  I want to use that little 
pine.icon I created with that special xterm!  Does anyone know how to 
associate a particular icon with an xterm?  If it matters, I am using mwm.

Sorry this isn't really a pine question ...

Thanks,

	-- Ted

Dear Michele

When you are in the main menu type s for setup.  Request c for 
configuration.  Somewhere in the configuration menu the is a sort menu.  
Choos whichever sort you want and it will be permanent.  The only problem 
is that you'll get your mail the same way.

Hi there,
Is anybody know how to get THE filter to use multiple rules on one mail?
Maybe I should explain what I mean... I want filter to forward an
incoming mail AND save it in a folder, according to the from section of
the mail.
I understand that I need to get filter to run a script and get the script
to do what I just explained; but, does anybody know how to write the
bloody script?
I greatly appreciate if anyone could send me a copy of her/his script.
Thanks in advance.

I'd like to thank everyone who informed me of the control-Z command,
which, when used with the -z command line switch, allow me to shell
out from PINE to the UNIX shell. It would be nice if this would work
without having to invoke the POSTPONE command (Control-O) of which
I was already aware, but I suppose I'll just have to get used to it,
or jump back into EMACS (which I haven't used since 1982).

No.  In a text-based environment, use Lynx.  In a graphical 
environment, use Netscape if you can, otherwise Mosaic.  There are
some other web browsers available too... Cello for example.

The WWW is interactive; you move around in it in real time.  Pine
does only email and news.

Wrong.  Did you try this?  

The "-w" option turns off word wrap (automatically moving words to the
next line when you get the end of a line).  It has no effect on what Pico
thinks are lines that are too long.  Try editing your .newsrc (which 
often has long lines) with Pico and you'll see it divide the long lines.

    Here in Z=FCrich, Switzerland, I type the foreign language of English
on the native Swiss-German keyboard.  If I were to want to write in one
of the native languages, like in German to describe the F=F6hn that one has
at times in the Alps, the keys for characters such as =E4 and =F6 and =FC a=
re
readily available on the keyboard.  Or if I were to write in French, those
keys =E0 and =E9 and =E8 are also there.  And there are dead-keys for the ^=
 and
` and umlaut to allow me to type =F4 and =C4 and =EC and so on.  And I have=
 keys
for =E7 and =A3 and =B0 as well.
    Not only does this keyboard have the keys for the characters I need,
but the communications program I use generates the correct 8-bit codes
for these characters to match the ISO 8859-1 character set which I've
specified on the configuration screen, last screen.
    So how do I type these native characters not normally used for
English words?  Very well and conveniently, thank you.

Pine.  What would be the best way for me to go about doing

I've created a pine alias called "majors" which contains the

I want to give this list to the chair of our department, without his

addressbook entry to him in such a way that he could use it without 
having to retype it?

Our establishment is different to yours, in that lots of people have 
reply-to set, as our standard email address is <something>@cam.ac.uk, 
whereas the sending domain & id will be <something>@domain.cam.ac.uk

It is usually a mistake to extrapolate from local knowledge and assume it 
applies widely.

That's my configuation. PC pine doesn't work - it dies

I installed it in the right place.
Has anyone got it working with this configuration ?
I'd appreciate hearing about it if so - or if not.
The machine is a DELL pentium.

I am trying to enable incoming folders so that all the mail I receive from
various machines will come to just one machine (I also don't have any mail
filtering programs, and use the different accounts for primitive
filtering).  

I "enabled incoming folders" with the config program, and then tried to
"Add" a new incoming folder.  When it asked me what server my other inbox
is at, I typed in ca0286, or on another attempt, the more complete address
of ca0286.caso.ca.blm.gov.  Then, although I wasn't sure exactly what it
was looking for when it wanted the name of the folder my incoming mail
would be at, I typed in /var/spool/mail/ldelucia (the default file for
sendmail).  However, Pine came back with "Can't connect to server
ca0286.caso.ca.blm.gov,143:"  Connection refused, and Can't access server. 

Did I do something wrong, or is Pine appending the ,143 onto my address, 
therefore making it invalid?

On another more trivial note, is there any way to enable the keyboard 
keys of home, end, backspace, etc.?

TIA :-)

I am having problems with winsock Pine that might be related to updating
the INBOX.  Randomly Pine will hang up with an asterisk in the upper left
corner. The windows style menus will still work except for Exit but none
of the keyboard commands will work.  Restarting windows is the only way 
get Pine back up.  My current theory is that Pine is trying to update
the contents of the INBOX from our VMS IMAP server.  I've noticed that
the INBOX is never updated. Must you expunge delted messages first?  How
is this supposed to work?

You can specify aliases for the incoming folders in the Setup/Config 
screen.  Here are some examples:

incoming-folders=Beth		/mntmh/ugrad/base/s/syb3/incoming/beth,
		 dadw		/mntmh/ugrad/base/s/syb3/incoming/dadw,
		 "S.P."		/mntmh/ugrad/base/s/syb3/incoming/sp,
		 "This is the 'DS' folder"	/mntmh/ugrad/base/s/syb3/incoming/ds,
		 "Not Piglet"	/mntmh/ugrad/base/s/syb3/incoming/figlet

I have tried repeatedly to setup Pine v3.90 to access local news groups 
on my DEC AlphaAXP system running OSF/1 v2.0.  If the * is in the News 
Collections entry, I see nothing and can subscribe to nothing.  If I 
leave out the * then I see folder collections in that directory, but then 
anybody can add and delete messages from those folders if they configure 
News Collections the same way.  Am I missing something here?  I am not 
using NNTP (these are supposed to be local news collections).  Or perhaps 
am I not setting up the files and/or directories correctly.  The News 
Collection entry I am trying to use is:

MHCC-News */usr/news[]

Any help or clarification on this would be greatly appreciated!
Thanks!

(apologies if this is in a FAQ somewhere, I couldn't find one)

I am attempting to assemble a list of resources (essentially a stack of 
manuals) for new 'Net users at my school.  While I can usually find what 
I want in a man page, the people I am putting this together for are 
pretty inexperienced with computers and rather frightened of Unix, in 
particular.  I was wondering if anyone knows where I can find some 
simple, easy to read/understand/decypher documents/manuals about Pine (or 
using FTP, WWW, Gopher, Archie, UseNet etc.).

Anyway, if someone could help me find such a file (if it exists), I would 
be eternally grateful (well, maybe not *eternally*, but at least for five 
minutes)...

Thanks

I'd like to request that when I list folders in pine there be a number 
with each folder name indicating the number of messages contained in each 
folder. I know I've asked for this some time ago but maybe it's more 
feasible now?...
thanks

You can either upload the file directly into the editor using an ascii send
function in you comm program, or you could upload the file before entering
pine, then use the ^R (Read File) command in pico.

Hi!

I am rather new to pine.  Since I am using a commerical server, I only 
get limited on-line time.  Does anyone know if there is a way to 
pre-compose messages offline (using a text editor) and then import them 
to pine?  It would save a lot of my on-line time.

Thanks

Subject: How to make Pine show headers and exit?
Date: 10 Feb 1995 18:06:07 GMT
Message-Id: <3hg9uf$gj6@news.cais.com>
Status: O
X-Status: 

When I login I would like to have Pine 3.91 display the header list of my
current mail then exit automaticly. How can this be done? 

I can easily enter the index and see the headers using -i, but it will not
exit on its own. If I try the inputed characters feature like so: -Ii,q
to force it to go to the index page and then quit it will pop up a
message saying its processing the 'keystokes' and then quits. The header
list in the index page *never* gets displayed. Trying variations like
'-i -Iq' didnt work either. 

So how can I get the mail header list displayed and have it exit on its own?
I'm trying to use this in my .login script using tcsh.

Thanks for your help!

George S.

While in the header, type ^r (rich header) and use the Bcc field. Send 
the message to yourself using an alias that will help you keep track of 
who gets what. Since I usually do this when I send messages to students, 
I use the course number as the nickname, the course name and term date as 
the full name, and my address as the address. Such an alias makes record 
keeping a bit easier.

	How about: cat /usr/spool/mail/geos |grep ^From |page

Should do the trick, and should also be a lot faster than loading up Pine
just to see what new mail you have! Oh, if you want to see the subject, you
could always use: 

	cat /usr/spool/mail/geos |egrep '^From|^Subject' |page

	By "THE" filter I suspect you mean 'filter' from elm.  Well, you
can't have that with the elm filter.  You need to switch to procmail.

You'll need imapd on those machines. I think what you should do is to

There was a dumb little mistake in my "wpine" script: it had an absolute
path when it called pine which is not necessary.

Originally I had called the script "pine" and put it higher in the path 
than the binary pine, so I had to call it explicitly.  But my system 
remembers the last place it executes a file from, so the first time I 
invoked "pine" I got the script, but the second time I got the binary.  
So I just renamed my script "wpine" but forgot to take out the absolute path.

It's easy to edit the script, but I thought I'd repost them.

A while ago you reported getting a GPF in pine.  I'm trying to track down
this bug and am looking for people who can reproduce it and would be
willing to run a test and send me the result. 

If so, please download a new test version of pine in

ftp.cac.washington.edu:/pine/Private/pine0207.zip

(You won't be able to read the list of lines in Private, but if you cd
there you will be able to get pine0207.zip by name).

Run this with Dr Watson and send me the resulting log.  You should find Dr
Watson in your windows directory called drwatson.exe.  Run drwatson first,
then pine.  When pine produces a GPF, Dr Watson will ask you to describe
what you were doing.  Then, find the report in drwatson.log and mail
it to me.

Thanks,

FWIW, I ended up doing a "gross kludge" on this.  The routine that sets
the return addresses in pine (for both mail and news) is getdomainnames(), 
defined in the file pine/osdep/domnames.  The original function checks to 
see if there is a local domain name attached to the host name, but if there 
isn't it simply uses the hostname as both the FQDN and the local domain
name.  I solved this by tacking on local domain name onto the hostname.  
This is the only "simple" solution I could see (there's probably a preferred 
way to get the full domain name from someplace other that gethostname(), but 
I don't know what it is).  What pine could do is allow the user to define 
a constant set to the local domain and put the code below in an #ifdef-#endif

Anyway, here is the diff (replace "uccs.edu" with your local domain name):

	pine/osdep/domnames
	47c47,48
	<         strncpy(domainname, hostname, dsize-1);
	---
	>         strcat(hostname, ".uccs.edu");

In the Pine settings for optional headers, add the undocumented sendmail
header 'Return-Receipt-To' and use the ^R command in the message
header area and insert your address there. I recommend *not* setting any
value in the header; otherwise next time you write to a mailing list you
will receive hundreds of return receipts. 

This is not an "official" header under the RFCs but many mailing systems
do honor it, same as the 'Errors-To:' header which is also non-standard.

	Hit ^R while in the header for 'Rich Header'.  This will

This wouldn't be like having a "real" OS/2 version of Pine, but as a 
second-best: how difficult would it be to compile a version of PC-Pine that
ran with IBM's TCP/IP for DOS 2.1?  That would allow it to run in an 
OS/2 DOS window using either the internet access kit in Warp, or the 
DOS/Windows access kit for OS/2 2.1.  

Lacking an OS/2 Pine, I'd rather run a DOS app than load Windows just to
read mail.  And, if I'm going to use a DOS version, I'd rather it use OS/2's
TCP/IP stack since it's already available.

A while ago you reported getting a GPF in pine.  I'm trying to track down
this bug and am looking for people who can reproduce it and would be
willing to run a test and send me the result.

If so, please download a new test version of pine in

ftp.cac.washington.edu:/pine/Private/pine0207.zip

(You won't be able to read the list of lines in Private, but if you cd
there you will be able to get pine0207.zip by name).

Run this with Dr Watson and send me the resulting log.  You should find Dr
Watson in your windows directory called drwatson.exe.  Run drwatson first,
then pine.  When pine produces a GPF, Dr Watson will ask you to describe
what you were doing.  Then, find the report in drwatson.log and mail
it to me.

Thanks,

Yes it IS possible to put escape sequences into almost anything. The 
question is if one SHOULD. Most often they only work for a certain 
combination of software & hardware. Sending an odd escape sequence to an 
unknown setup could screw their session window or worse. Of course it 
MIGHT actually work. Not advised practice.

 I've created a pine alias called "majors" which contains the

 I want to give this list to the chair of our department, without his

 addressbook entry to him in such a way that he could use it without 
 having to retype it?
  Thanks.

Yes and no. You can select sort order in your configuration setup but 
that also affects your mail sort order. The option for seperate sort 
defaults for mail & news is on the pine teams todo maybe list.

This is also happening on AIX3.25 with a default shell of tcsh. This

I did experience Sherry's problem in a OSF/1 2.0 environment, and the

I would like to suggest a new option be added to Pine to allow someone to 
select the option to automatically "delete" a message when the mailbox they
are reading is a newsgroup.  This would then automatically update their 
.newsrc file.  One would not have to remember to delete articles in order 
to add them to the "read" list.

To be compatible with current pine, the option should default to off, so
that people who want this feature would have to turn it on.

It might be worthwhile to do it this way: if someone upgrades a config 
file as a result of the automatic upgrade when their system changes to a 
new version of Pine, then it should leave the flag defaulted to off; new 
users who have no config file would default to on.  Either that, or 
inform upgrading users that the option will automatically be set to on and 
they should disable it if they do not want this feature, the way Pine 
informs them on the first time they use it during a month and asks if they 
want to move the current saved mail folder to the name of the previous month.

A TCP/IP datagram containing a NOOP is 86 bytes.  86 bytes transmitted
once every several minutes is not a "precious resource" unless you're
using 300 baud modems. 

This is way down in the noise of bandwidth.

This is a myth which the designers of TCP and TCP software (especially
Phil Karn of KA9Q fame) have tried for years to debunk.

By "active connection" you presumably mean "open connection", not
"connection actively transferring data" -- inactivity timers have no
effect upon the latter and thus it makes no sense to profer it as a
solution to the latter "eating away at system resources".  Open but
inactive TCP connections do not "eat away at system resources".  TCBs are
not finite resources. 

A lot more harm than good comes about by server administrators who play
around with server timeout values without understanding the underlying
mechanisms involved.  The purpose of server timeouts is to garbage collect
abandoned connections from PCs/Macs which were dropped without a reset,
since otherwise the PC will try to reuse the same port after rebooting and
find it can't get in.  They are otherwise to be avoided at all cost.

Reinventing history is always fun, but I'd rather not do it here.  The 
NNTP protocol as specified in RFC-977 has a huge number of omissions.  In 
fact, RFC-977 doesn't even specify the protocol that is actually in use.

It is never wise to assume intent when error is a plausible explanation.

> Again, consider "reconnection" as an alternative to timeout suppression.

I fear that it will probably be about the time that hell freezes over that
I will finish the long list of tasks to make things work that currently
don't work (IMAP4 and IMSP loom high on this ever-growing list), and will
have the luxury to go back and redo things that do work. 

On the other hand, we provide source code.  If this is so important to 
you, why don't you write the code?

Hello all,

I suppose that you know about TIA, if not you could probably help me as well.
TIA is a SLIP emulation Software which tell's the rest of the net that you
are working on your UNIX host Computer and not on your own, that's why reply
mail won't work. E.g. on my host I can be called like root@mycomputer.somewhere.

And now the Question:

It's a simple one, how can I get tia to send mail with another address in 
the from Line than mine? BTW This has to run on my system only I do have root
privilegues if necessary.

Thanks for hints

Firstly, I'd ask the question, "Why are you being mail bombed?". Then, I 
would suggest that you report the person that is doing it to their system 
administrator. If you set your .forward file to pipe your mail into a 
program such as "filter" (from the Elm distribution), you could bounce 
such mail from a specific person back to them.

You should see your signature file appear automatically if it is saved in 
your home directory with the name, ".signature".

I often find it more useful to only insert signature files selectively, 
so I created a couple of signature files with names like cpc.sig and 
omb.sig.  Those aren't appended to messages automatically, but I can 
insert them whenever I want, as I'll do in a moment, by using ^R to read 
in a file.  I keep those *.sig files in my home directory.

specify Base64 decoding, which is what MIME uses.

Is this likely to be changed? Many people (including myself) use Pico as 
as an editor to go with Tin, to provide a consistent editing environment 
between news and mail. When following up to an article in a long thread, 
the References: header can get rather long, and Pico happily wraps it 
when the article is loaded in, meaning the two lines have to be manually 
joined to prevent all the headers getting messed up.

Surely if it can create longer lines while editing, it can't be that 
difficult to make it load them, too...?

Steve,
On the AIX system, do you mean that if someone disconnects *and* their 
shell is tcsh, then Pine runs wild?  Or does it happen with tcsh even if 
you are not disconnected?

In contrast, are you saying that switching to tcsh *solved* the problem 
on OSF?

Hal and Bill,
Both your messages leave me wondering if Pine's "user-domain" variable is 
not working for you, or if you simply haven't tried it.  It should certainly 
not be necessary to change any code to set whatever domain name you want!

-teg

p.s for Hal: a common reason for gethostname to return the wrong (short)
version is that the names are in the wrong order in the /etc/hosts file.
I believe the FQDN should be first.

I think this only works on text files, but there is a file called
`ansiprt.c' that comes with the pine source at: 

  ftp.cac.washington.edu:/pine/pine.tar.Z

Get that file, uncompress and untar it (do it on a temp drive or check 
your disk quota first).  Then you'll find ansiprt.c in:

  ./pine3.91/contrib/utils/ansiprt.c

(assuming you're currently in the directory you untar'd from).

Compile it, and then delete everything else.  It will print what it gets 
on standard input on your attached-to-ansi printer.

  % ansiprt < file.to.print

To be able to use command line arguments (e.g. `ansiprt file.to.print'), 
in csh:

  % alias ansiprt 'cat \!* | \ansiprt'

(Followups directed to comp.mail.pine)

I agree that it is probably not a great idea, but it is an interesting 
question.  How Do you put the escape sequences into PINE.  Is it editor 
dependent?  I believe our system uses PICO

I have successfully compiled pine under SCO Unix 3.2v4.2.
How do i disable the newsreader function completely?
We do not and will not use it.

Do I HAVE to go back to an older version?
Is it better if I go back to an older version because it will be smaller and faster?
Can I leave out the newsreader part during the compile?

Thanks in advance

Subject: SCO Sendmail over UUCP Help!
Message-Id: <3hgubg$gue@dingo.cc.uq.oz.au>
Date: 11 Feb 95 17:55:22 GMT
Status: O
X-Status: 

I HAVE to set up sendmail over UUCP.
I *think I  have the UUCP setup ok. Well, I can connect and the script works.
I am using SCO's flavour of sendmail and I hear this sendmail v8 is pretty damn
good. I'll do anything for GOOD documentation *gasp*.

You see, I got thrown in the deep end and for the past week I have been drowning.
I was told "please hook us up to the Internet. Thankyou!". Well MMDF looked like
the horror story that it is. And the mail program leaves a lot to be desired *yuk*. So
I blithly said nothing and away I went.... Boss won't pay the money for a professional!

On the first day....  :-)
"What is MMDF?" (Mutant Mungrel Damaged Forwarder?)
"UUCP" oh... I see...	ahh connected! WRONG HOSTNAME?
"Changed host name... oops Lotus won't run and no-one can print!"

On the second day... ;-)
"MMDF - I thought channel was a perfume?"
"New activation key from Lotus and printing fixed!"
"Oh I need to get Pine... ahh! PPP over TCP/IP!"

On the third day ....:-|
"PPP ... DNS won't work!"
"PPP doesn't work! oh, need upgrade AND patch"
"Hmmm I DO NOT want to use named!"
"Discovered /usr/lib/uucp/uuinstall,  hmmm that's a lot easier"

On the fourth day .... :-(
"Umm why DNS not working? ahh resolv.conf GOD I HATE UNIX!"
"Oh! upgrade TCP/IP and patch! NOW it WORKS, got pine"
"pine man pages? troff/nroff/tbl? You have to BUY THESE EXTRA?"
"Pine uses SENDMAIL? Pine needs libcrypt.a????"
"AhHA! got the crypt lib but its called libcrypt_i.a! hmm: ln libcrypt_i.a libcrypt.a"
"Activated sendmail byebye MMDF good!"

On the fifth day ... :-O    ->   #@%^#$!!
"Compiled gzip, zip, unzip, where do I get troff/nroff/tbl??? gnu version requires c++!"
"Pine keeps activating the PPP link. I can't have that!"
"Pine is sending mail but to where????"
"Ahhh crontab for UUCPing .... where does sendmail put its stuff?"
"Where does UUCP pick up the mail from (directory)?"

NOW... *grin* what a week!
So there you go and that is where I am. PPP has been disabled until I can figure out
a way to implement some security (someone mentioned TCP/IP wrappers (that's next)).
I think I did ok considering I knew NOTHING about the SCO mailing system or serial
TCP/IP. It was a hell of a ride and it still needs finishing. You see, I left the company on
Friday ... my last day. And knowbody there knows a damn thing about it. I will have
to finish it for them but now they will PAY me properly for it.

It isn't quite working as yet but I am very close... UUCP is ok.. need to set up the crontab
entries. Asking around to find out why Pine is activating the PPP link... in fact it won't
start until the link is up and running!
Next ... Get Pine -> sendmail -> uucp running completely.
Install procmail, and tcp/ip wrappers for PPP link (You see i need to have
telnetd and ftpd running for internal network.)

*sigh* still got some work to do but at least I have some idea now.
If you can make any suggestions then please do so. I am committed to using UUCP
for mail at this stage. Please forward this to the appropriate groups/people if
required.

Thankyou sincerely and humbly in advance

Kevin

Message-Id: <3hk26p$hlu@ns.oar.net>
Status: O
X-Status: 

   Other than running Pine with the -o option is it possible to quit
without saving?

   Why would one like to do this?  Well, I like to run pine from home
to look at my mail.  Sometimes, it would be nice to save my changes
and sometimes it would be nice to abort them.  I would like to abort
my changes after I read my my mail and I have not saved or deleted any
of my messages.  But when I quit pine my mail file is altered and the
next day my Sun's mailtool (X based) - which I run because I deal with outside 
customers that require Suns mailtool attachments - complains that my 
mail file has been altered.  At this point I must quit mailtool and 
restart it.  It would be nice if I could quit without saving.  Is this 
possible?  The only way that I know to get around this is to type ^Z and 
kill the process.  (Note, Sun's command line mailer allows me to quit without 
saving with the "x" command, but it does not have near the flexiblity of
pine.) 

   I am running pine 3.91 and I did not see any quit with out saving 
feature in the manual.  If this option is not currently built into pine
it would make a nice enhancement.

Thanks in advance,
Eric Youngquist

  I know that the UNIX pipe command has been added to allow 
pine user the ability to send email messages to UNIX programs/

(aka. address) that is a UNIX pipe?  It would be nice to be
able to forward a message to an alias that can process it
similar to pines pipe UNIX capability.  The address would look
something like this:

	pwr                |/users/pdetools/pwr/pwremail

   I have tried to forward to this address, but I get an error.
But I can send/forward an email message to the UNIX program
through pines UNIX pipe capabilites.

   If this option is not currently built into pine it would
make a nice enhancement.

Does Pine have any built-in facility to copy address information from the 
system's Global Addressbook to a personal address book?  Outside of Pine, 
I have found that you can grep the global file for the name you want and 
append the output to the personal file (.addressbook).  Then Pine sees what 
was added when you start it.  But is there a more direct way?  This 
method can easily get more than you want, which then has to be deleted.

X-Status: 

I am a keeper of a number of FAQs. I would like to go to a method of
auto responding based upon the subjec field. For example "send FAQ"
in the subject field of an incoming email would autmatically send a
file to the sender.

I know there is also a way to automatically reject an email based upon
the sender or subject.

Any help would be appreciated! Email if possible and I will later post
a summary.

Have you considered $orting the folder Subject wise?
In addition you could sort it Reverse so that you will see the first
question then the following responses under it. Enjoy!

Subject: 0.0 About this Article

Q: How can I have my incoming mail messages automatically put into an 
   appropriate folder?

This is one of the most frequently asked questions about email.  This article 
is the first release of an FAQ that addresses this question.  This version 
gives basic instructions for how to set up either procmail or Elm's filter 
to filter incoming mailing list messages.  Future versions of this FAQ will 
include instructions for doing other things like automatically replying to 
certain messages.

If your system has both procmail and filter installed then you should use 
procmail which is *much* more robust and powerful than filter.  This 
recommendation is almost universal; even the Elm and filter developers
recommend procmail over filter.

Subject: ... 0.6 Reading the Plain Text Version of This Article

If you are reading the plain text version (i.e., not the hypertext version) of 
this FAQ it is in RFC1153 digest format which means each subject is formatted 
as a mini mail message with its own Date, From, and Subject (and sometimes 
 Followup-To) headers.  Some newsreaders and mailers make it really easy
to jump to a subject in an article that is in digest format.  Here are 
instruction for some newsreaders:

* NN's default is to split a digest and present each digest item on the 
  menu.  If you have changed the default by putting ``set split off'' in 
  your ~/.nn/init file then you can split an article that is in digest 
  format by typing G% while viewing it.  This will present each digest item 
  on a submenu.  You can then read, followup-to, save, print, etc. individual 
  digest items.

* In trn (and its relatives like rn and strn) you can type ^g (Ctrl key 
  and g key pressed together) to skip to the next line that begins with
  "Subject: "

* In emacs GNUS, C-c C-n will skip to the next digest article (C-C C-p will
  go back to the previous digest article).


If your newsreader or mailer does not have a built-in command that allows
you to easily read a digest you can pipe the article to ``formail -ds''
which will split the article into separate mail messages, and then you can
use your mailer or newsreader (if it can read mail folders) to read the
folder.  For example, here's what you would do in Tin while viewing
the article:

Type...                           In order to...
-------                           --------------
|                                 Pipe
a                                 Specify the article is to be piped
formail -ds >> ~/mail/faq.split   Split the digest into individual
                                  messages and put them in a file named
                                  ~/mail/faq.split.  (Replace ~/mail
                                  with your folder directory.)
pine -if faq.split                Use Pine to read the newly created folder.

For more information see the formail(1) man pages.

Subject: 1.0 Naming Your Incoming Mail Folders

For my incoming mail folders I use names that start with ``IN''.
For example, I put mail sent to the procmail mailing list into a
folder named IN.procmail.  I do this so that when all my folders
are listed alphabetically the incoming folders are together and
near the top.  They are near the top because Unix is case sensitive
and upper case letters come before lower case letters in an ascii
sort.

Of course, you can use any names you like for your mail folders.

Subject: 2.0 Procmail

Procmail is a powerful mail processor that can be used to process your
mail messages either as they arrive or after they are in a mail folder.  
This version of the FAQ describes the basics of setting up procmail to
filter incoming mailing list messages.

To find out how to process existing mail folders see the NOTES section
of the procmail(1) man page.

------------------------------

Date: 17 Nov 1994 23:02:10 GMT
From: Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: ... 2.1 Setting Up Procmail

1] Find out if procmail is on your system and what the full path to it is.  
   If you are using csh type:

     which procmail

   Or if you are using sh or ksh type:

     type procmail

   If neither ``which'' nor ``type'' are on your system try ``whereis'' and
   ``where''.  If your system doesn't have procmail ask your system 
   administrator to install it.  If your sys admin isn't able to do this,
   use a different mail processor like deliver, mailagent, or filter 
   (described in part 2 of this FAQ).


2a] Create ~/.procmailrc.  (Note that throughout this article I use
    pico for editing files.  Replace ``pico'' with your editor.)

     cd
     pico .procmailrc

  
2b] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.procmailrc.
    Note that lines that begin with # are comments and are ignored by
    procmail.

     #Set on when debugging
     VERBOSE=off
 
     #Replace ``mail'' with your mail directory (Pine uses mail, Elm uses Mail)
     MAILDIR=$HOME/mail
     
     #Directory for storing procmail log and rc files
     PMDIR=$HOME/.procmail
     
     LOGFILE=$PMDIR/log
     INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/rc.test
     INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/rc.folders

3] Create the directory where you will store your procmail log and rc files 
   (this is $PMDIR that you set above).

     cd
     mkdir .procmail


4a] Create an rc (run commands) file for testing:

     cd
     cd .procmail
     pico rc.test


4b] Enter the following in ~/.procmail/rc.test:

      :0:
      * ^Subject: .*test
      IN.testing

    Note that the first line contains a zero (0), not the letter "oh".
    For now, don't worry about the meaning of this recipe.  It is
    explained in the subject "Explanation of Test Recipe" below.


5a] Create a ~/.forward file by typing the following. (Pico's -w flag tells 
    pico not to auto wrap lines.)

     cd
     pico -w .forward



5b] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.forward:


     "|IFS=' ' && exec /usr/local/bin/procmail -f- || exit 75 #nancym"


    == IMPORTANT NOTES ==
    * Make sure you include all the quotes, both double (") and single (').
    * The vertical bar (|) is a pipe.
    * Replace /usr/local/bin with the correct path for procmail (see step 1).
    * Replace ``nancym'' with your userid.  You need to put your userid in 
      your .forward so that it will be different than any other .forward file 
      on your system.
   
    * Do NOT use environment variables, like $HOME, in your .forward file.
    * Do NOT expect ~ to mean your home directory in the .forward file: If 
      procmail resides below your home directory write out the *full* path.


5c] Note that on many systems you need to make your .forward world 
    readable and your home directory world searchable in order for the
    mail transport agent to "see" it.  To do this type:
   
      cd
      chmod 644 .forward
      chmod a+x .


6] Send yourself two test messages: one with ``test'' in the subject
   and one without ``test'' in the subject.


7a] Start your mailer (pine, elm, etc.) and check that the messages
    were delivered correctly.  The one with ``test'' in the subject
    should be in the folder $MAILDIR/IN.testing and the one without 
    ``test'' in the subject should be in your inbox.  If these were
    delivered correctly go on to step 8.


7b] TROUBLESHOOTING
    * If the two messages were not delivered correctly look at your
      $LOGFILE (~/.procmail/log) to see if you can determine what
      the problem is.  

    * Check these three files for typos:
        ~/.forward
        ~/.procmailrc
        ~/.procmail/rc.test

    * Check the file and directory permissions of your .forward (set in 
      5c above).

      Type...          In order to...
      -------          --------------
      cd               Go to your home directory.
      
      ls -l .forward   Check the permission: it should say -rw-r--r--
      
      ls -ld .         Check permission of home dir: it should say drwx?-x?-x
                       The ?'s may be r's or hyphens or one of each (i.e.,
                       drwx--x--x, drwxr-xr-x, drwxr-x--x, drwx--xr-x).
      

    * If none of these turn up the problem edit your ~/.procmailrc so
      that it contains:

        VERBOSE=on

      And repeat steps 6 and 7.  If you are still having problems see the 
      subject "Troubleshooting: Alternate .forward Files for Procmail" below.

   
8a] Once you have successfully tested procmail in steps 6 and 7, create 
     rc.folders for filtering incoming messages into mail folders.
  
      cd
      cd .procmail
      pico rc.folders


8b] Enter a modified version of the following in ~/.procmail/rc.folders

     :0:
     * ^TOwww-talk
     IN.www-talk

     :0:
     * ^TOprocmail
     IN.procmail
     
     The first recipe filters the www-talk mailing list and the second recipe
     filters the procmail mailing lists  The meaning of the first recipe is 
     as follows:

     Notation      Meaning
     ========      =======
     :0            Begin a recipe
       :           Use a lock file
     *             Begin a condition 
       ^TO         Match ``To:'' ``Cc:'' or other synonyms for To at the
                   beginning of a line, followed by any or no characters,
                   followed by....
          www-talk  ``www-talk''
     IN.www-talk   If successful match, put in folder $MAILDIR/IN.www-talk

  
     Create a recipe for each of your mailing lists.  Make sure that you
     use ``^TO'' with no space between the caret (^) and the word ``TO'', 
     and that both letters are capitalized -- if you don't it won't work.

     Note that ^TO is not a normal regular expression.  It is a special
     procmail expression that is designed to catch any destination 
     specification.  See the MISCELLANEOUS section of the procmailrc(5)
     man page for details.  For examples, see procmailex(5) man page.
     

9]  Repeat steps 6 and 7 to make sure that things are still working.


10]  Comment out the rc.test line in you .procmailrc file so that it looks 
     like this:
          
       VERBOSE=off
       MAILDIR=$HOME/mail
       PMDIR=$HOME/.procmail
       LOGFILE=$PMDIR/log
       # INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/rc.test
       INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/rc.folders

     Note that it's useful to leave the rc.test line there for future testing.

Subject: ... 2.2 Tracking Your Incoming Mail

There is a useful script, which is part of the procmail package, for 
checking your procmail log file called mailstat.  Check to see if it is 
on your system by typing either ``which mailstat'' or ``type mailstat''.  
If it's on your system type:

  mailstat $HOME/.procmail/log

This displays a concise version of your log file and moves your log 
file to log.old.  You may want to put the above line in your .login so that 
each time you log in you will see a listing of how many messages you've
received since the last time you ran mailstat, and what folders these
messages were delivered to.

You can get a mailstat listing of log.old by using the -o flag:

  mailstat -o $HOME/.procmail/log


If mailstat is not on your system ask your system administrator to
install it.  It is located with all the other procmail tools at:

ftp://ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/pub/packages/procmail/procmail.tar.gz

Subject: ... 2.4 Troubleshooting: Alternate .forward Files for Procmail

If the .forward template in 5b above doesn't work the following alternatives 
might be helpful:

In a perfect world:
	"|exec /usr/local/bin/procmail #nancym"
In an almost perfect world:
	"|exec /usr/local/bin/procmail USER=nancym"
In another world:
	"|IFS=' ';exec /usr/local/bin/procmail #nancym"
In a different world:
	"|IFS=' ';exec /usr/local/bin/procmail USER=nancym"
In a smrsh world:
	"|/usr/local/bin/procmail #nancym"

These formats can be tried in different combinations, the leading "| can
be tried as |" instead, or vice versa.

Some systems do not need a .forward file (i.e., having a .procmailrc file 
suffices if procmail already is the local delivery agent).

Subject: 3.0 Filter

Filter is part of the Elm package of tools.  Note that you can use filter
to filter your incoming mail even if you are not using Elm to read your mail.

IMPORTANT NOTE
==============
If your system has both procmail and filter installed then you should use 
procmail which is *much* more robust and powerful than filter.  This 
recommendation is almost universal; even the developers of Elm and Filter
recommend procmail over filter.  IT IS POSSIBLE TO LOSE MAIL MESSAGES
WHEN USING FILTER; this is rare but it has happened.

From: Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: ... 3.1 Setting up Filter
Followup-To: comp.mail.elm

1] Find out if filter is on your system and what the full path to it is.  
   If you are using the C shell (csh) type:

     which filter

   Or, if you are using the Korn shell (ksh) or the Bourne shell (sh) type:

     type filter

   If neither ``which'' nor ``type'' are on your system try ``where'' and
   ``whereis''.  If your system doesn't have filter ask your system 
   administrator to install it; or even better ask her to install procmail.


2] Note the full path of your home directory by typing:

     cd
     pwd


3a] Create ~/.elm/filter-rules.  (Note that throughout this article I use
    pico for editing files.  Replace ``pico'' with your editor.)

     cd
     mkdir .elm
     cd .elm
     pico filter-rules

  
3b] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.elm/filter-rules

     if (subject contains "test") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.testing"
   
   Replace /j/nancym with your home directory path (see step 2).
   Replace /Mail with the name of the directory where your mail folders are
   stored.  Pine and Berkeley Mail use /mail (lower case m) and Elm uses 
   /Mail (upper case M).
   

4] To see what the filter rule will do type the following at your Unix 
   prompt:  

     filter -r


5a] Create a ~/.forward file by typing the following. (Pico's -w flag tells 
    pico not to auto wrap lines.)

      cd
      pico -w .forward


5b] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.forward:


     "|/usr/local/bin/filter -o /j/nancym/.elm/filter-errors"


    == IMPORTANT NOTES ==
    * Make sure you include the quotes (").
    * The vertical bar (|) is a pipe.
    * Replace /usr/local/bin with the correct path for filter (see step 1).
    * Replace /j/nancym with your home directory (see step 2).
   
    * Do NOT expect environment variables, like $HOME, to work in your 
      .forward file.
    * Do NOT expect ~ to mean your home directory in the .forward file.


5c] Note that on many systems you need to make your .forward is world 
    readable and your home directory world searchable in order for the
    mail transport agent to "see" it.  To do this type:
   
      cd
      chmod 644 .forward
      chmod a+x .


6] Send yourself two test messages: one with ``test'' in the subject
   and one without ``test'' in the subject.


7a] Start your mailer (pine, elm, etc.) and check that the messages
    were delivered correctly.  The one with ``test'' in the subject
    should be in the folder IN.testing and the one without ``test'' 
    in the subject should be in your inbox.  If these were delivered 
    correctly go on to step 8.


7b] TROUBLESHOOTING
    * If the two messages were not delivered correctly look at your
      ~/.elm/filter-errors to see if you can determine what the problem 
      is.  

    * Check these two files for typos:
        ~/.forward
        ~/.elm/filter-rules

    * Check the file and directory permissions of your .forward (set in 
      5c above).

      Type...          In order to...
      -------          --------------
      cd               Go to your home directory.
      
      ls -l .forward   Check the permission: it should say -rw-r--r--
      
      ls -ld .         Check permission of home dir: it should say drwx?-x?-x
                       The ?'s may be r's or hyphens or one of each (i.e.,
                       drwx--x--x, drwxr-xr-x, drwxr-x--x, drwx--xr-x).
      

    * If none of these turn up the problem edit your ~/.forward so
      that filter will be verbose with it's output (use the -vo flag).

        "|/usr/local/bin/filter -vo /j/nancym/.elm/filter-errors"

      And repeat steps 6 and 7.  After you get filter to work you 
      will probably want to change the ``-vo'' flag back to ``-o''.

   
8]  After you have successfully tested filter in steps 6 and 7, edit
    ~/.elm/filter-rules so that it contains a modified version of the
    following:

     # if (subject contains "test") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.testing"
     if (to contains "www-talk") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.www-talk"
     if (to contains "hopos-l") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.hopos"

     Replace /j/nancym with your home directory path and
     /Mail with the name of your mail directory.  Replace the mailing 
     list string (e.g., "www-talk") and the name of the mail folder
     (e.g., IN.www-talk) with text for your mailing lists.

     Note that ``to contains...'' means either the To or Cc header contains...

     Rather than deleting the test line, it's useful to just turn it
     into a comment (by preceding it with #) so that you can easily
     use it for future testing.

Subject: ... 3.2 Tracking Your Incoming Mail
Followup-To: comp.mail.elm

You can get a short summary of filter's activity by typing:

    filter -s

For a longer summary type:

    filter -S

Or you can look at the log file itself, ~/.elm/filterlog.

You should regularly look at ~/.elm/filter-errors to make sure things 
are working.  You can automatically check filter-errors each time you
log in by putting the following in your .login:

    tail ~/.elm/filter-errors

Also you probably want to regularly delete filterlog and filter-errors so 
they don't fill up your disk space.  To get a summary of the filter log and 
clear it type:

    filter -cs

It is not uncommon to set the the gethostbyname function to return only
the inital machine name, not the FQDN.  This is not a bug, it's just the
way that some machines are or can be set.  Our DECstations do this as do
our Suns.  Other networked communications packages I have built (tin,
rn, elm) realize this, and allow you to define a constant somewhere in
the source that gives the remainder of the domain name.  This is
appended to the machine name returned by gethostbyname whenever it is
called.  Why doesn't Pine?  I ask this because we are having the same
problem here (with both mail messages and news postings from by Pine)
and I've been looking for a simple, clean patch.  I guess I don't
understand why this isn't a problem for any of these other programs
like it is for Pine.

Anyway, let me through in a "me too" and ask if anyone else has a simple
patch for this.  BTW, has this been reported as a bug to the Pine developers?
I was going to, but I was trying to find out if I had simply missed something
in the FAQ.

Get your hands on procmail and install it (if it hasn't already been installed
on your box). Have all your mail piped to procmail (ie ~/.forward file contains
"| /usr/local/bin/procmail") and using appropriate rules to filter your
mail in ~/.procmailrc, you can sort/bounce/discard your mail according to
sender, subject, mail-text and other criteria.

That is correct. My experience on both OSF1/2.0 and AIX/3.25 has produced 
this annoyance. When users in the PC labs disconnect, pine spins out. 
The method of the disconnect was something to do with a Cntrl+X type of 
disconnect. I could do some more digging if it would help.

Yes. I could recreate the problem with csh and OSF. By moving to tcsh, I 
was able to eliminate the problem. 

I did some tests with AIX and csh with earlier versions of pine without 
being able to recreate the problem. Now with pine3.91, I see the same 
problem I encountered with OSF. 

I was hoping that someone was aware of this problem and that there was a 
solution already out there. If you wish I could do some more testing of 
this?

     Say what?

     I got the same result when trying to post this message; I postponed 
both and later was able to send the first. If you see this, it obviously 
finally got out also. What's happening?

I have been using the mkpgp program for some time to integrate PGP and

good way to decode the mesage without using multiple files and ^Zing out.
Is there a good way/script to decode a PGP encoded message I receive?

System is SCO Unix 3.2v4.2.

I have a PPP link setup under SCO so we can Telnet out to other sites.

When I run pine it will not start until until the PPP link is established.
In fact whatever it seems to do makes the link start up of it own accord.
If it does a Domain Name Search then yes the link will start up as the system
points to a external DNS through the /etc/resolv.conf file.
I have not specified any SMPT addresses.

What is it doing?
How do I stop this?

Thanks in advance

I have seen similiar problems under BSDI and Pine 3.91.  A user disconnects,
and their Pine image goes hog-wild in the background, sucking up as much CPU
time as it can get.

All the problems on the machine I administer have been with the tcsh shell
and Pine.  Most of the users use tcsh anyways.

It is a most annoying problem, though.

A quick a dirty solution:

Compose a message with that alias (distribution list?) in the "To:" 
heading.  Then use the cut feature and uncut it in the body of the 
message.  Put the chair's address on the message and send.

Does this work?

Estimated sirs,

My sysadmin recently migrated me to PINE (ver. 3.89). I've found very easy
and confortable to work, but I haven't found the posibility to discriminate
the incoming mail to concrete folders. I'd tried to configurate the 
incoming-folders line in the .pinerc file, editing, as Release Notes say,
but without outcomes. 
I wonder if its possible re-directionate the incoming messages with regards
to their from, to, subject, date and other headers, such as its possible
in the sorting option, to the folders I desire.

Pine has been recently setting up here, instead of the EAN software, and 
some users very busy in listservs and mailing lists estimate useful this
option. I request you because our postmasters and sysadmins unknow this
(they should to)

Very thanks for your assistance:

Get the latest version of procmail - it compiled "out of the box" on my 
Linux system.  You can get the latest version from:

        ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de (137.226.225.3)

as (g)zipped tar file:     /pub/packages/procmail/procmail.tar.gz       
as compressed tar file:    /pub/packages/procmail/procmail.tar.Z

The former sysadmin at this side had pine aliased to a script that
would run pine, and then at the end of the session would check to see
if the sucker was still going.  I think he also killed the process if
it was, but he at least sent a message to the user, reminding them to
cleanup their pine processes.

	The feature you are looking for is not part of pine.  To do what
you want you will need to acquire "filter" program such as "procmail" or
"filter" (from the elm distribution) etc.

	One place to acquire promail would be:

	ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de /pub/packages/procmail/procmail.tar.gz

Hi everyone!

I am trying to get pine to read and post news articles to our local machine.
In the past, I have been using cnews and nn for news, but users would rather
use pine to read and post news instead of nn.  So what I did was get
a copy of nntp and compiled it.  In the pine.conf file, I have this line:

nntp-server=thehill.chrh.org			(our "local" machine)

Which causes pine to properly post news, but I can't read news.  If I try
to read news, I get the following error:

"No state for newsgroup found.  Reading as new"

To overcome this problem, I have this line:

news-collections=News *[]

Is this an acceptable configuration, or is there a problem with the nntp
communication that will not allow reading?  I am new to "nntp", so it
is quite possible that I do not have something configured correctly.

I'd appreciate any tips!

Hi everybody,

I am using pine-3.91 with the character set ISO-8859-1 to 
display the accents of some european langages. When I
read the mails everything is fine, I can visualize these accents.

Unfortunately, when I want to print them, I can't
manage getting the proper accentuation. For example 
the character \`e (tex) becomes =E8 !!!

Has anybody solved this problem before ? If you have,
could you please send me your solution, my email
address is 'goirand@lmd.ens.fr'.

Thanks in advance,
best regards,

Problem is, the vt100/vt102 terminal emulation in many telecomm programs 
is incomplete, so the software doesn't know what to do with the print 
job.  In some cases the message text prints to the screen instead of to 
the printer.  In other cases, nothing happens at all.
 
The workaround is to use Pine's export command (e) to save the message as 
a text file in your home directory, then cat the file to your screen, 
capturing it on the fly to your own computer, or download it to your 
computer and print it from there.

Dear all,

last week I asked the same question, however didn't get an answer.
So here it goes again:

Does auto-move-read-msgs also work when connected to a remote incoming

My experience says no.

What's yours?

Thanks in advance

The information below works with Winsock Pine

If you are using an NFS-type system mount your UNIX home directory as an 
NFS drive (e.g. M:\) and tell PC-Pine that your addressbook etc is at 
M:\mail\filename. For filename you will have to substitute the cookied 
version of the filename (i.e. with "~" or "^" characters) shown by doing 
a DIR command on the now mounted m:\mail directory. You cannot mount it 
as m:\mail\.addressbook.

Thanks Michael, but I'm afraid this is not the answer for two reasons:
I don't know how to ^R(ead) a file from one person's account to another's
(if I'm logged in as me I don't have access to his; & vice versa; right?)
and (2) I also have the same question about other address lists.  I'm
the editor of a newsletter, and want to send my mailing list to a number
of other people, but thought that giving one example would be enough and
so didin't mention that I also have other lists I want to forward to
other people.  Any other ideas?   Thank you very much for your help.

No, but the next version will have a TakeAddress command which works from 
one address book to another just like it works from a message to an 
address book.

I have not figured out why tcsh fixed the problem on OSF1/2.0 nor have I 
figured out why it doesn't fix the problem on AIX/3.25. I do however have 
it on my TODO list. I hope to get into this soon. 

I have talk to DEC. They say "Yeah, looks like a problem to me.". The 
trouble is, their response was to use tcsh. That is not my idea of a DEC 
fix. I fough with their support people for *6* MONTHS for a csh fix. 
Their reply was "thats the way csh is designed.". I gave up on DEC.

This could very well be related.

Has anyone been able to get pine to compile on AIX 3.2.5?  I've gotten 
pico to compile, but pine generates a compiler error then dies!  I'd like 
to be able to compile it with optimization to cut down on its memory 
requirements and speed it up a little!

I get the following error using the IBM C compiler:

        cc -DA32 -O   -DSYSTYPE=\"A32\" -c os.c
"os.c", line 1628.22: 1506-045 (S) Undeclared identifier MAXPATH.
make: 1254-004 The error code from the last command is 1.

Any help would be appreciated!

If anyone has tried to make it using shared libraries as well I would be
interested in hearing about it.  We have 18400 accounts spread across six
sites and the 40-70 concurrent logins are a killing with most users
checking their mail via PINE.

Pine currently supports folder-collections, but that is all at this time. 
We are planning to implement hierarchical collections in the future
though...

Greetings,
I'm using a Windows PC to dial-up a Unix machine, which uses PINE 3.91 to 
manage mail and newsgroups.  Comm software is Procomm Plus for Windows 
(v1.1, I think).  I've used Procomm+/Win's ASPECT scripting language, and 
the Meta-keys and programmable keyboard features to make Pine easier to 
use (say, for occassional users).

The question:  Has anyone written a script, like with navigation buttons 
and such, in Procomm+/Win that would present a point&click interface to Pine?

Thanks.

yes it is quite possible indeed it has been done :-) btw if you are
a dos user you need ansi.sys installed in your config.sys
like so:
device=c:\dos\ansi.sys

I'm not sure about other OS's

however i know escape sequences do some funky things with windows. 
my login is in color and windows "jumps" back from my prompt when i log in
so i have take the mouse and scroll down back to my prompt which returns
to the default crl%.

if anyone wants to see an example i'll be more and happy to mail you
one. Then you can save it to file and edit it down and insert it
in any documents you wish :-)

Okay, I answered my own question.  I now know how to start Pine in an 
xterm and set what its icon should look like:

I start Pine using

	xterm -n Pine -name Pine -title "Pine" -e /usr/local/bin/pine &
                      ^^^^^^^^^^
			this is what tells the window manager what the
			application is called


In my .Xdefaults I have

!
!  This tells the window manager the name of the bitmap to use for the icon
!  -- substitute with the correct window manager name.
Mwm*Pine*iconImage: /user2/stern/.xbm/pine.xbm

!
!  Pine doesn't inherit any of the specific XTerm stuff, so it needs to be
!  defined.
!
Pine*VT100.font:    -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--15-140-*-*-c-*-*-1
Pine*VT100.Geometry:    80x50+10+10
Pine*VT100.saveLines:   0
Pine*jumpScroll:        off
Pine*scrollBar:         off

#ifdef COLOR
        Pine*foreground: White
        Pine*background: DarkSlateGrey
        Pine*cursorColor: Red
        Pine*pointerColor: Blue
#endif



The bitmap I use is attached.  It is a slightly shrunken version of the 
one on the Pine WWW site.

The X resources for window managers are read only when the wm starts, so 
they won't take effect until you restart.

I built a set of binaries for Pine 3.91 on SCO Unix 3.2.4, called
pine3.91.sco.bins.tar.gz, and put them on odi.cwc.whecn.edu, and alongside
Bill Campbell's source/binaries package on ftp.celestial.com.  I have
discovered that there is a problem for non-US people using my binaries.  I
compiled it using US-specific crypt libraries.  Apparently, non-US
versions of SCO will core-dump if you run this binary.  At least, some do. 
I recently fixed a problem someone was having in Mexico by rebuilding Pine
using SCO's international crypt supplement. 

If you are outside of the US and have a problem with my Pine where it 
says something like "Pine caught a signal... closing down" whenever you 
try to start it up, let me know and I can make the international version 
I built available for you.

Sorry David, but I think you are missing a important request here.  
I would refine the question to "why is there no text/URL mime type".  If 
this type was "blessed" then the mailcap file could be set to envoke any 
Web "viewer" the user's system could support.  The two "killer apps" in 
the internet are WWW browers and e-mail.  Currently many of the Web 
browsers provide some type of e-mail interface.  It sure would be nice to 
be able to include an attachment which when viewed would access info via 
a URL. This would provide the ultimate  MIME .signature facility.
Of course this is possible now in a non-standard way, but it would move 
much more quickly towards becoming a standard if PINE backed it.

I believe the PINE dev. team are leaders in providing MIME-based 
mail systems, and are in a good position to "show the possibilites" of MIME 
e-mail.  I feel that this type of integration between the WWW world and 
MIME e-mail will soon happen...the question is how well will this 
integration be thought out and who's bennefit will it serve. Let's not 
let MS, or the likes, again set defacto "standards".  

Keep up the good work.

At the main menu type 'S' for setup and then 'C' for config.
Go down to the entry 'nntp-server' and use the 'A' (add) command
to add your newserver to this entry.

On some systems

There follow a few suggestions to improve how usable Pine is.

The following apply to Pine 3.91. I was running Pine on unix 
(Solaris 2.3), but the suggestions may well apply to other flavours of 
unix Pine.

^J Attach
   I switched on the option  use-current-dir  but found that attach takes 
   you to your home directory, instead of to the current one.
Empty folders
   Would it be too difficult to arrange things so that when you open an 
   empty folder, pine returns immediately with a message to that effect, 
   instead of actually opening the folder, which is slower (maybe due to 
   the current implementation of IMAPD ?).
Directory browser
   I would love to be able to go straight into directories when I 
   select them, instead of having to confirm by pressing yes. 
   Similarly for selecting files. Could there be an option for this, 
   maybe called something like browse-without-confirm. This would be 
   similar to the select-without-confirm option.
Folder name completion in address book
   For consistency I would like to be able to press tab, and have a 
   folder name completed while I am editing the Fcc of an address book 
   entry.

Apart from minor cases, such as the ones above, I am very happy with Pine.

Hello!

We are working with PC Pine and the HPUX port of Pine, both v3.91
and have some questions concerning how the mailcap file is 
constructed.  If we attach a MS Word document to a Pine message
the Content-type header field lists it as Multipart/Mixed with
a boundary= parameter.  When we go to view the document/attachment
in the PC Pine version with an entry in our mailcap file as follows:

Multipart/Mixed;c:\word\winword %s

The MS Word application launches but we receive an error stating the
file c:\temp\imxxxxxx.doc can not be found/open?  The file never gets
created in \TEMP either.

We are wondering about a couple of things.  First is their a Content type
for specific vendors applications?  If so, where can I obtain a list of
registered content type values that I can use in my mailcap file?  I
understand the IANA keeps these.  Second, what is the proper syntax for
the mailcap file to have it launch say MS Word for Windows, Lotus for
Windows, etc. based on the attachment content-type?  I have noticed that
our TCP/IP stack vendor (FTP Software) includes a MAPI compliant mailer
that puts a content-type value in when you use it to mail attachments.
It gave the above MS Word document a content-type of:
application/MSWORD.  I read there a extension tokens that can be 
referenced in the mailcap.  Are these regeistered, and can I obtain a
list of registered extensions (ie .DOC, .WK4, etc.)?

Any help on the subject of constructing the mailcap file, and valid
supported content-types, extension tokens, etc. would be greatly 
appreciated!

Best regards. . .   Mike

This message comes from your NNTP server, not from Pine.

Although it seems to be saying that the disk is full on that system, my 
experience suggests that the disk is out of inodes.  In other words, 
there are too many files.  It's possible for 50% of the disk to be free 
and still get this message.

Nag the sysadmin of the NNTP server to rebuild that disk with more 
inodes.

If you *are* the sysadmin:

1) rebuild that disk with more inodes.  You need a lot more inodes on a
news spool disk than on an ordinary filesystem. 

2) As an interim measure to get the news flowing again, blow away a few
thousand files on the server.  Good places to look for garbage are some of
the more active rec.* newsgroups, and especially the alt.* and *.pictures
newsgroups (groups with names such as alt.sex.dirty.pictures are good
targets).

Hey, you IBM and DEC people think you got all the fun :-)

I'm running a Sun SparcIIk with Solaris 2.4..... you got it,
the same problem. (with ksh)

I'm not sure what can be done about it, but if I come up with anything 
I'll post it here.

(my current solution is a script that kills certain things if that 
process is running without a user connected. (ie not in the "who" list).

I don't like this though, since with 200+ people online, this script does 
more harm than good...


Enjoy,

Is it possible to change the key bindings in Pine/Pico?  I realize that they 
were chosen to be comfy for Emacs users, but Emacs users could just use Emacs 
(alternate editor).  I'd like to make it comfy for Mac/Windows users.  All Mac 
programs use ^X=Cut, ^C=Copy, ^V=Paste, and as far as I can tell, many Windows 
programs have also copied this standard.  Can this be done in Pico?

Many thanks from a new but genuine Pine convert...

I'd like to intercept an outgoing file just before Pine throws it out the 
door to do a little postprocessing -- namely, I want to digitally sign it, and 
also encrypt it if the recipient address is one that I have a public key for.
I can do all this in a script if I can just catch that file before it goes.

Alternatively, I could use the "alternate-editor-cmd" to wrap Pico in an 
encrypting script (I'm using such a setup experimentally right now).  But this 
means a few extra keystrokes, and only works for signing (because the script 
has no way of knowing who the recipient might be).  Any ideas?  Thanks...

I believe what you are looking for can be accomplished by modifying the 
sendmail.cf file.  I have *no* idea how to do it, but I am 
pretty sure that is where you need to intercept it.

I would start by defining an array of designated addressees in a 
reference file, which is read when the sendmail daemon is started.  
Messages to those recipients would be preprocessed by your script and 
sent on their way as normal.

Maybe someone out there will know if this would work and, more 
importantly, how to do it.

I've done it by inserting/changing one line in my .pinerc file:
incoming-folders=POPMail {mailbox.cc.binghamton.edu/pop3}

however, i've had some serious problems when using pine as a popmail client
over a short time period (one week).  I've one user who always get's the
following message right after connecting to the popserver (this print's after
it lists some of the headers):
Bug in Pine detected: "Received abort signal".

I'm leaning towards a pine bug because eudora under windows has no problem
fetching the articles (nor does Windows 95 mail client have any problem
with them)...

Since it's an undocumented (and probably unsupported feature) I will report
this bug (but, I don't expect an answer)....

   I have been using the mkpgp program for some time to integrate PGP and 
   Pine to encode messages.  The problem is, I haven't yet figured out a 
   good way to decode the mesage without using multiple files and ^Zing out.
   Is there a good way/script to decode a PGP encoded message I receive?

Set the "include-text-in-reply" option in Pine.  "Reply to" or "forward" the 
message so you can run the alternate editor.  When the alt-editor runs, mkpgp
will detect the message and decode and/or check the signature.  Keys 
received by e-mail are added to your keyring the same way.

Any idea about my problem ?       Gildas.

Can anyone tell me how to get pine to bring in all new articles in a 
newsgroup with the "N" symbol next to them, just as unread email messages 
are presented?  I would like to have the "N" flag then to be removed as I 
read the articles, and for the read/not_read status flags to be preserved 
from one session to the next (much as in other newsreaders, such as tin).

I can select all articles with ";" "A" , then "a"pply "*" "N"  manually.  
pine *says* it is marking all the articles as unread....but it lies!  It 
does no such thing.

Am I doing something wrong, or am I just asking too much of pine in its 
current stage of development as a newsreader?

Yes, you are missing the point. Perhaps I explained it badly.

What I want to be able to do, via setup, is to say
default-save-folder=my.favorite.save

so that when I select
saved-msg-name-rule=default-folder
it goes there and not to savemail.

I'd like to make an attachment of a dvi-file (device independent...)
such that when viewing it, xdvi is launched.=20

I thought that the only thing I needed was to define (in my ~/.mailcap)
the following:

# use this to display dvi files
application/x-dvi; xdvi %s

However, when I attach a dvi-file, it is OCTET-STREAM'ed, of course.
When ``viewing'' it, it is decoded.

Any help is *really* appreciated!

Is there a way to change the way the 'title' of a quoted reply looks like?

Maybe I'm not asking this correctly. :)  What I mean, is the message 
that appears before the area of text to which you are replying like:

    "On (time/date), (user's name) wrote:"

I know this is configurable on most other mail packages, but I haven't 
seen anywhere to change it in Pine.

Also, can the character that appears in the 1st column of the quoted 
area be changed?  Say, from ">" to ":" for example.

Pardon the rambling message, I'm not really sure how to explain it. hehe

   When a user hits return prior to putting a comma in the CC: field to 
add more addresses, it naturally puts the comma in the Attchmnt: field.  
When they they press RETURN, pine aborts because of a Panic it 
received.  Is it possible to return an error message and not have pine 
core dump?  Or can something be set in compilation or .pinerc to not have 
pine abort.

Message-Id: <3hr93i$hhi@core.bard.edu>
Status: O
X-Status: 

I'm trying to set up PC-PINE with PC-NFS 5.1a (I've also tried with
version 5.0 and some patches).  The 5.1a PCs are using DNS; the 5.0
machine uses NIS (but it'll be upgraded soon).

I set up the inbox-path and folder-collections configuration variables
with {myhost}INBOX and {myhost}mail/[] respectively.  "myhost" is
running imapd on tcp port 143, and I can telnet to that port from the
PCs.  And the telnet leaves me with a syslog message, because I have
tcp_wrappers between imapd and the naked port.

But when I run PC-PINE, I invariably get "[Host not found: myhost]."
And no record of a connection in syslog on "myhost."

"myhost" is listed in \nfs\hosts, the NIS hosts map, and the DNS.

I've got over 500K free memory.  I've tried it with and without RTM
loaded (but free memory drops dramatically with RTM).

Back in October, I had it working!  But I can't figure out what's
changed now that I've picked it up again.

Anyone have a solution?

Hi,

I have problems to read e-mail on NFS mailbox directory with Pine 3.91
under IRIX 5.3. I got a patch from SGI to solve problems with NFS and
mail lock file but this one just solves the problem for 'Mail' reader,
not for Pine. When pine tries to read mail in an NFS mailbox, it hangs
up. I didn't have this problem under IRIX 4.0.5. However, I recompiled
Pine under 5.3 without more success.  I know that I can use IMAP from
Pine but I would prefer NFS for several reasons.

Does anyone solve this problem ?	Thanks in advance for help.

Gildas.

	I've also seen people with a size 7 foot trying to wedge it into
a size 5 shoe.  They were subsequently upset when they lost all feeling
in their feet and complained to the shoe manufacturer about their poorly
desiged shoes.

	Pine was designed as an IMAP client.  It was done so with good
reason.  Why would anyone want to shoehorn pine into a POP client when
the easiest and most benificial action to take would be to install the
imapd?  Would you attempt to force Eudora into imap mode?

One of our users has moved to a machine where she will use pine.  Is there

I have never been able to get this working (even using the IP address
of the IMAP server instead of a host name). I have spoken to several
other people who have also never been able to get it working. I
have not heard from a single person who -does- have it working. If
you figure it out, please post; it will be a public service.

Does anyone have a sample .mailcap or /etc/mailcap that they can mail me

It was a while ago, but I think that simply adding in the line 

setenv VIEWER xv 

to your .cshrc is sufficient to tell mosaic to use xv as its veiwer. (Try
replacing "xv" with /usr/bin/xv or whatever the path is to xv if that
doesn't work. You can often find out the path to various programs by
typing "which xv" or "whereis xv".) As for pine, set 

image-viewer=xv

in your .pinerc, or do it through the Setup/Config option.  

I haven't figured out mpeg yet, but if anyone has a suggestion, I'd love 
to hear it.

I am using Pine 3.91 on a system with SunOS 4.1.3.  In a seemingly random 
fashion Pine will add a new incoming message to the last message that came in. 
I have found as many as 5 seperate messages (coming from different people) 
all strung together into one message.  It doesn't seem to happen in a 
consistant fashion ie. sometimes all of the messages are separate and 
sometimes some of the messages are combined while others are separate.

Does anyone know what is going on?  This didn't happen until Pine was upgraded 
to 3.91.

	I'm not sure if this is a bug, but two of us have now had (a little)
trouble using pine with a non-local nntpserver. If, for example, you should
want to read your news from the the non-local nntpserver
another.computer.com, if you simply add the following stuff to your .pinerc: 

	news-collections=News *{another.computer.com/nntp}[] 
	nntp-server=another.computer.com

then you get an error message that says

	another.computer.com: Connection refused, 143.

If, however, you use the ip number of another.computer.com (1.2.3.4) 
rather than "another.computer.com", then it works:

        news-collections=News *{1.2.3.4/nntp}[]
        nntp-server=1.2.3.4

I don't really know if this is a bug in pine or the same bug in two 
completely different systems (scripps.edu and callnet.com) to two 
completely different nntpservers. Does anyone from Pine-development care 
to speculate?

P.S. I love pine more and more everyday. I just saw Z-mail and I like 
	pine better.

Make sure that rpc.statd is running on the client machine.  After
upgrading several of our systems from 4.0.5 to 5.3, /usr/etc/rpc.statd

reinstall eoe1.sw.unix or copy it from another system running 5.3.

Does anyone know how to compile Pine for SCO Unix.

When I executed the command: build sco

I got the following output.

As you can see, Pico compiled just fine but Pine did not.

Any help anyone can offer would be greatly appreciated.

I think that installing imapd is not the "easiest and most beneficial"
thing always. It is not the easiest thing if you don't have the root
privileges or if you have to write the program yourself to implement
it in KA9Q Nos. It is not the "most beneficial" thing either on every
platform. The most important assumption behind the imap is that the
server machine is more powerful and resourceful than the client. What
about if the reverse is true as in my case. 

I don't want to say that Pine has to be a POP client. The decision is
developement team's and I would respect it. But, the functionality
seems to be there and doesn't work correctly. Either, it should be
fixed or taken out completely. There is no sense in leaving a buggy
portion of the code in the already huge Pine executable.

Greetings: I would like to know how Pine implements the Flags that it 
shows for NEw, Answered, etc. mail. Is there a field in each mail item that
reflects the status? Can I expect other e-mail readers to respect this flag
or modify it in some way that Pine will not know about the next time I
read my email with Pine?

Thanks

I think people are going to Pine for the user interface.  Whether the
backend should be IMAP or POP is a separate issue.

We're getting pine to run POP because we want to distribute the CPU
load over 8 login hosts in our unix cluster instead of running
hundreds of IMAP processes on our one mailhub.  Also involved in this
choice is that we want users to keep mail in mbox and not spool, for
disk quota reasons; so a connection to mailhub and the spool is needed
solely to move new mail in, which is already a POP model.

Now the University of Washington want IMAP, and we should recognize
they have no great interest in designing and testing a POP
implementation they won't use.  We shouldn't expect them to write it
for us.  If that's what Ed is trying to say, OK.  But don't act like
IMAP answers all needs.

What does the mail system at Washington look like, anyway?  Just out
of curiosity.  What is the imap host and how many users is it
handling?  Ours is a Sparc 20 and we have 20,000 accounts with over
40,000 messages delivered daily... can't do much imap on that guy.

Problem:  My PC-Pine can only connect to my SMTP server for sending mail 
only for one session.

Background:  I have PC-Pine version 3.91.  My SMTP server is a HP9000.  
My mail server is also the same HP9000.  If I start my PC-Pine without the 
PINERC file and input the informations as I used PC-Pine, everythings work
fine for that session.  I can read mail and send mail as many time as I 
want, but once I exited from that session I cannot used that PINERC file 
again for connecting to my mail server to send mail.  That PINERC file is 
only good for reading mail.  If I try to use that PINERC file for 
connecting to my server to send mail, I always get the following error:

	[ Error connection to mail server: ]

If I exit and delete my PINERC file and reinput the informations again 
when I use PINE, everything works fine again until I exit from PINE and 
the problem start all over again.

But I don't see any reason why you can't configure pine and IMAP to
meet these requirements. Why not distribute the IMAP servers ? 
[ There are a lot of possible mbox/spool configuration, but I'm not
sure what exactly you want. It's hard to propose an alternative 
without knowing the details, but I don't understand why you need 
to funnel everything thru a single IMAP server. ] 

On paper, and from my own limited experience, I would have to judge
IMAP as far superior to POP. But I haven't had experience with it
in a large scale, and one option UVA is considering for their 
university wide mail system would be a IMAP based system, so if there
is a specific reason that you think it won't scale up, I would like
to know.

Actually the longer range plan is to split mailhub, and so at that
point we can go back to IMAP.  One thing is that PC clients will
continue to grow in popularity, with our campus network reaching more
and more rooms, so we won't have the level of control over user
choices that we do now where a great majority still read mail on our
hosts, and we will have to make IMAP work no matter what.  IMAP does
have many advantages.

The lesson is to be sure you distribute the IMAP load if it is a big
installation.

Works fine for me, running SCO Unix 3.2.4.2 with MMDF IIb 43(f), where 
the (f) stands for "mucked about with by SCO".  hat system are you 
running on, and how can you tell it isn't working?

The WWW URL for Pine information (includes archives of 
pine-info/comp.mail.pine) is

	http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine/


The bitmap you want is

	http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine/pine.xbm


And no, I don't know how to specify what bitmap is used for the icon for
window managers other than Mwm!  In particular, if anybody knows how to
set up an icon for Pine under Olwm, could you send the answer to

	Steven Feinholz <sf3@elsegundoca.attgis.com>

I haven't been able to help him very much.

You can get WWW via pine two ways. One way is getting a page without html 
tags and the other is with them (you get the page, save it as an html or 
htm file, and view it with your own browser. This is good if you are 
behind a firewall, I imagine. You must know the url you are requesting.

Send email to: listserv@info.cern.ch
no subject
for pages without html tags type:
send http://address.of.url/more/information/here

for the tags still embedded, type:
source http://address.of.url/more/information/here

Of course, you'd type out the address you're interested in. NOTE: I

	I don't believe that IMAP puts much more, if any, strain on your
system resources than POP.  I don't know where you got the impression
that "server machine is more powerful" in the case of IMAP and not also
in the case of POP.

	IMHO, it would be more worth your while to implement IMAP even
if you have to port the IMAP daemon to your machine.  The time would be
well spent to acquire the added funtions of IMAP.  At least it is time not 
spent in trying to get an unsupported and undocumented feature working.

	I could find no information in the documentation that stated this
this feature is available or supported.  

	I believe that the Pine Team has stated in the past *not* to expect
this undocumented feature to remain.  BTW, you'd be surprise how many
undocumented features to be found in "payware".

	Mostly true.  Some are making their choice "pine" or "ECS Mail"
because they support IMAP and perform better than POP in a mobile
environment.

	I'm a bit confused here.  IMAP is a superset of POP.  How you
distribute email over various machines is unrelated to what protocol to
use to access individuals email.  Also, (at least on the systems I'm
familiar), them method to invoke "popd" is the same as "imapd".  That is
via inetd.  In both cases a copy of the "daemon" is invoked for each user.

	Neither POP nor IMAP will be the answer for eveyone's needs.
All I'm saying is pine is designed to work well with IMAP in the same way
the a client such as Eudora is designed to work well with POP.  I believe
would be doing a dis-service to jam either one into the others world.

	I believe they have a rather large user community running IMAP
on a not so powerful machine.  (This is from memory of a discussion quite
some time ago on a POP v.s. IMAP discussion.)

Instead of messing around with the -z switch, why don't you just alter 
Pine's configuration to allow it any time?  In 3.90 and 3.91, select 
Setup from the main menu, then select Configuration.  Or in earlier 
versions use your favorite text editor to edit your .pinerc file.  In 
either case, you want to enable-suspend.

There is no need to use ^o to postpone a partly-composed message before 
suspending Pine with ^z.  Hit ^z with your message on screen.  When 
you're ready to come back to Pine, enter fg and you'll be right back 
where you left off.
 
EMACS???  Its best left in 1982 where it belongs!  :-)

Being an ocean lover, and spending ALOT of time in the water, I can Say 
Jellyfish stings (depending on the species) can REALLY, REALLY be painful.

So, it's not drugs or anything else. I got stung by a Portugese-Man-of-War, 
and a Box Jelly fish
(at seprate times!) and It was THE MOST PAINFUL experience of my life. No 
lie! The nematocyst cells of a jelly fish (the cells that sting) really put 
the muscle cells into shock, and depending on the sting, can have lasting 
effects for weeks. If you were ever stung by a Jelly you know what I mean. 
People have Died from Jelly stings!

Status: O
X-Status: 

Do I read you correctly ...  by implication I assume you want to give
less weight to the "grading" process to tests that happen to turn out to
be easier, and more weight to exams that turn out to be harder?  Or,
another way to look at it is ...  do you want to give more "weight" to a
score (X) earned by a student on a hard test than to someone who earns X
on an easy test?

It seems to me that if your goal is to do that, since difficulty has
more or less an interval meaning (mean on test out of number of items or
points possible) ...  you are trying to combine information using a
lower ordered statistic than the quality that the data presents you
with.  I don't understand why you want to resort to combining rankings
(more or less) in this way.  Can you elaborate?

It seems to me a more logical approach is to FIX a scale ahead of time,
and let the fact that test will vary in difficulty be taken into
consideration by the scale that one works towards: ie, students that are
really smart will do well on tests regardless of whether they are hard
or easy ...  but weak students cannot do that.

Of course it was illegal, but was that really the point of the whole

The fact is that there are enough of a lack of resources in the classroom
as it is without the extra necessary for a large amount of ESL or NESB
children.

   Although the 

	   (this(patternName)##)

   statement would be shorter, I guess the use would be limited to object
   creation. (No computed references and the like.)


It would be very nice to have 

  &(this(patternName)##)

and also

  patternName(# ... #)##. 

They are both examples of immediate, anonymous constructs,
i.e. constructs that introduce and use program entities which are
normally explicitly declared and named.  An example of this which has
been around for many years is the (lambda ...) construct in lisp et
al.  In BETA a prominent example is 'patternName(# ... #)' as an
imperative.

An immediate, anonymous construct is relevant whenever the given
program entity will only be used at one point in the program.  When
the name is only used once, it just pollutes the name space of the
program and makes it harder to read and more tedious to write.


Here's a nice, contrived example using 'patternName(# ... #)##':
Suppose a chemicalPlant forks off threads to control aspects of
chemical processes, like

  &|system(# stabilize: ^stabilizer;
          do &pressure_stabilizer[]->stabilize[];
             35.0->stabilize.best_value;
             cycle(# do get_pressure->stabilize->set_pressure; 1->sleep #)
          #)[] 
  -> fork;

where 
  
  stabilizer: realObject(# best_value: @real do INNER #); 

and "get_pressure" reads some kind of meter and "set_pressure"
interfaces to some external pressure control device.  Then we might
want to adjust the strategy used by pressure_stabilizer now and then,
like 

  stabilizer
  (# 
  do (if true
      // value>1.2*best_value then
         high_alert;
         best_value*value->sqrt->value;
      // value<0.8*best_value then
         low_alert;
         best_value*value->sqrt->value;
      else
         no_alert;
         (value+best_value)/2.0->value;
     if);
  #)## -> 
  chemicalPlant.pressure_stabilizer##;

This specialization of stabilizer is only used at this point of the
code, and the chemicalPlant wants to make instances of
pressure_stabilizers.  So we want a pattern variable, and we want it
from an immediate (anonymous) construct.

It's very much like another immediate, anonymous construct, 

  do ...
     chemicalPlantPattern
     (#
        pressure_stabilizer::< 
          (# 
          do (if true
              // value>1.2*best_value then
                 high_alert;
                 best_value*value->sqrt->value;
              // value<0.8*best_value then
                 low_alert;
                 best_value*value->sqrt->value;
              else
                 no_alert;
                 (value+best_value)/2.0->value;
             if);
          #);
     #);
     ...

except that we _cannot_ afford the luxury of creating a _new_
chemicalPlant but need instead to adjust the behaviour of an already
existing one.

In my experience situations like this one are not all that rare, and I
think the ability of BETA to support anonymous constructs (other than
this one, as yet) is very important.  Without that, the source code
would be a lot less readable (and also much more tedious to write).
Actually I don't understand that the importance of immediate 
constructs seems to be an absolute non-issue in most news groups
discussing programming languages!  A typical BETA program probably
contains a substantially larger number of classes/patterns than a
program of comparable complexity in, say, Eiffel, Sather, or C++.  It
is simply a lot easier to create patterns/classes when immediate
constructs are allowed, and the many little enhancements or
"customizations" of already established functionality is clearly one
of the forms that widespread reuse can take. 


Does anybody see any serious problem (other than the grammar :-) in
allowing the construct <ObjectDescriptor>## as a <StructureReference>?

nuoc mam can be made from fish sauce that you can buy from asian
supermarkets. please go to either chinatown, or little saigon, if
you have one in your neighborhood. mix the nuoc mam with warm white
vinegar and sugar ( to taste ), crushed garlic ( fresh ones, not the
flaky stuff that comes in a jar ). and store the whole thing in a
glass jar. when you are ready to use it, add some nuoc mam in a side
dish and freshly crushed red peppers. if you need an exact-amount-
ingredients recipe, post the request, and i will try. i am sorry
but i keep changing the recipe depending on my mood and guests.
the current recipe that i used came from my own mother who is pure
chinese, so go figure.
by the way, the "correct" term is "nuoc cham". nuoc mam is pure, or
impure depending on what brands you buy, fish sauce. "impure" means
that it is either a mixture of fish and other sea-based whatchamacallit
or just pure whatchamacallit.
hey, on the other hand, where is your sense of adventure?

The only solution is to use Owner draw listbox. Associate a COLORREF value
to each item using
SetItemData method. In DrawItem method, draw the item using the color (

I'm afraid you know too much.  We'll have to kill you now.

With logic like this, you could prove that flowing neckties were the

Let's wake up here, people.  We are talking about discrimination, NOT racism.
Racism is an off-shoot of discrimination.  The constitution says that one
cannot discriminate on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, and age.  
It does not say anything about discrimination against homosexuals (which it
should) nor does it say anything about discrimination against "fat people."
There are other discriminations out there that go on that are perfectly 
legal.  That's what the whole gay-rights movement is all about.  And a
business man would much rather hire a shapely female secretary than someone
who might be overweight, but more qualified for the job.  America isn't as
swell as some think, eh?

I doubt that. There is no conclusive evidence supporting the preventions

removal.

There is no cause and effect relationship between not cleaning an intact
penis and penile cancer.  How many women need to have parts of their vulvas
surgically removed because they don't clean themselves???

People in America focus on so many different aspects of their physical
bodies...women slap cosmetics on their faces in a vain attempt to make
themselves beautiful...balding men go to extremes to remedy their baldness...
women of all ages focus on being thin (some to the extent of becoming
anorexic or bulimic)...women have their breasts enlarged...men and women
get facelifts...men look into ways of enlarging their penises...ad infinitum.
Aside from the anorexics and bulimics, are these people neurotic? 

Millions of women out there are very happy with the size of their breasts; 
does this mean that those who choose breast enlargement (or reduction) are
overreacting? That's certainly not the message our society gives. If
breast surgery gives these women a better sexual self-image, then good
for them. Why can't the same be said for those men who aren't satisfied
with the current state of their penises?

Wayne is focusing on unnecessary surgery that was performed on his penis
when he was an infant. Why is that wrong? Just because *you* and others
don't think it's a big deal does not trivialize Wayne's view. If you don't
like what Wayne posts, then don't read it. I personally appreciate Wayne's
presence on USENET News. Trying to get parents-to-be to consider not allowing
their sons to be circumcised is a good thing.

I wonder how you would feel if some physician sliced off your labia as an 
infant? Would you be upset, or you would you just deal with what was done
to you?

Circumcision, male or female, is genital mutilation, plain and simple. 
People may try to justify it as a tribal/cultural/religious rite, but it
*is* genital mutilation.

But only if you believe anyone here takes SAT scores as a serious
indication of intellectual ability... at least no IQs are being bandied
about.

Flamingo is an endangered species, but in a nice way...
they're so popular, it's getting hard to get in.

The brother of the owner lives across the street from me,
and we're friends... email me your phone number, and I'll
suitably chastise him into calling you!

You can try the TNRCC (512-239-1000, and ask for the Mobile Source
division), they can't tell you much until the politicians decide what they
want to do.

The major cities in Texas are counting on the I&M program for substantial
emission reduction credits toward attainment of the federal ozone
standard. If the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 aren't repealed, those
emission reductions are going to come out of somebody's hide. Small
businesses and large industrial types aren't too happy about that,
especially the DFW business community.

EPA has backed off on one aspect. That is, you can now get your car fixed
and tested at the same place. In the old system if you failed the test,
you had to go somewhere else to get it fixed and then come back to retest.
EPA said that they would allow you to re-test at your mechanic. 

Other than that, I don't think the plan has changed substantially - it has
just been delayed. I'm sure that the state legislature and governor will
come up with a substantially different plan, but they don't have much time
given the short legislative session and so many other issues on the
agenda. I also don't expect the governor to try to gut his dad's Clean Air
Act.

I think that it is a flawed program. Most of the emissions from mobile
sources come from "gross emitters". I've heard that over 90% of the cars
tested passed. It seems like some remote sensing system would be a less
intrusive way of identifing the bad actors.

Well - if you're including books amongst your specification of 'things'
then two books doing the rounds on the suplus/junk book stores at the moment
are :-

1) British History, Rodney Castleden, Parragon (1994), and
2) World History, Rodney Castleden, Parragon (1994)

expect to pay GBP 2-3 each.

Otherwise, if you mean electronic versions, let me know!

Because Cannabis seems to compel you to followup to your own post 5 times:)

Seriously, though, I always thought it was something to do with the

still consider it some sort of moral nasty. And we all know what position 
the ignorant hold in this country...

He has, now can you explain why if an act is already illegal in LAW ( de jure)
but not in fact, creating an additional law is going to change the fact?
If the problem is De Facto, doesn't the remedy need to be also? Otherwise
you are left with empty symbolism.

No it didn't, it took the supreme court enforcing the existing laws,

As I point out some people will raise that objection about ANY
sexual behavior.

But are you equally loathe to consider it an illness?  My question was
why is it 'a mental illness' and not other forms of sexuality.

Should employers be required to hire people who regulary PRACTICE
beastility? Should you be required to rent to animal 'lovers'.
necrophiles?

BLUE BELL, PENNSYLVANIA, U.S.A., 1995 FEB 15 (NB) -- Unisys Corp.
(NYSE:UIS) has bought a European software firm and will build
around it a new software subsidiary to be called USoft.

Unisys has acquired TopSystems International, a European firm
known for object-oriented and repository-based application
development tools for distributed computing. USoft starts life
with about 125 former TopSystems employees in Europe and a staff
of about 50 in North America, only about 15 of whom came from
Unisys, said Michael Seashols, president of USoft.

"We are aggressively expanding the North American operation,"
Seashols told Newsbytes. USoft expects to have a worldwide staff
of about 300 by the end of this year, he said, and most of the
growth between now and then will be in North America.

Seashols said Unisys' existing software business, which is worth
about $700 million per year, will remain part of the parent
company. With USoft, "we're going after a little different market
space," he said. The new business is to focus on development
tools for what Seashols called "server/client computing." He
explained that he reverses the usual order of the words to
emphasize the fact that USoft's philosophy will center on the
server.

Most client/server systems development up to now has concentrated
on the desktop interface, Seashols argued, and while this works
for smaller systems it does not work as well for large,
enterprise-wide systems supporting 50 or more clients. USoft's
approach will be to view the central server functions as most
important, with what appears on client screens as a by-product of
that.

USoft is going after a market that is worth several billion
dollars, Seashols said, but one where there is currently no
dominant player. Major database software vendors, developers of
object-oriented development tools, and others are approaching
this market from different angles, he said. "We've got a market
opportunity to solidify a very strong company," he said.

USoft, based in Brisbane, California, also will offer consulting,
education, and support services related to "server/client"
computing.

In my previous message, my brain slipped and I typed CPU where I meant
memory.  Sorry about that.

IMAP holds INBOX in memory on the server throughout the time that the
client (pine) runs, while POP just sends the spool contents out to the
client.  This means the load on the server end is a lot higher when a
couple of hundred people run an IMAP client than a POP client.  Note
that we were using the mbox driver with IMAP, so what POP does is
similar in effect, that is, new mail gets appended to mbox as the user
runs pine.  Users of PC-based clients (PCPine, Mailstrom) connecting
IMAP to our mail server see their mbox as INBOX.

I am getting more faculty requests about printing from PINE while at home. 


How do I get UW modified Kermit for the MAC?

It seems that is the only 'certified' program. I doubt users will want to 
have to purchase VersaTerm Pro on top of what they are already using. 
Some use White Knight, some use Claris.

I use pine/pico on a 132x60 screen and it works fine. When I'm using
it as the pine editor it automatically wraps at column 72 or
something, whereas when used as a regular editor I can use the whole
width of the screen, so it's perfect.

This is a known bug in collection expansion in Pine 3.91.  Pine fails to

The c-client library (Pine's low-level code) does, in fact, implement
*{host2:11919/nntp}comp.foo.bar, as a test with the G command will
demonstrate.

I am configuring pine at our site, and have some problems
with MH folders.

1. pine can't create new folders

2. pine refuses to list my inbox mh folder
   I have found two ways arounds on this

   a. Name the inbox folder #mh/inbox[]
      This have one large problem: How do I do a inc from pine???

   b. Use goto to open #mh/inbox[]

3. It lacks usable support for large MH folder trees.
   ie folders with folders with folders...


We have to support MH folders, as pine is going to be used as text based
email reader, and exmh as X11 based reader, and exmh works with mh folders....
(ie, exmh is our primary mail reader)

I have the pollowing lines in my .pinerc

news-collections=News *{host1/nntp}[],
	More news *{host2:11919/nntp}[]

host1 is my primary server, and there is a server on host2:11919 for 
experimental purpouses.

When I try to expan the folder in the folder list screen, I get the 
complain, that host2,119 rejects connection. That is true -- nobody is 
listening to 119. But why is pine going to 119 at all? It should try to 
connect to 11919 instead.

I know why -- most probably it was not envisioned, and thus -- not
implemented. Implementation of this feature could have potentially many uses.
Mailing list archives and news groups archives can be maintained and served
by NNTP and IMAP, besides gopher and WAIS. Pine is a fine front end for
message-based archive searching, and its potential uses as such should be
encouraged. 

Along these lines, if pine is used to connect to a large archive 10s of Ks
of messages, it is better _not_ to read all headers before giving control 
to the user to place their selection.

It seems to me that you're making a number of assumptions about the 
IMAP vs. POP models which are not necessarily true.

Where are the physical bits located?  On an NFS server?  Have you
considered the costs of having all that NFS traffic (remember, the
*entire* mail file needs to be sent over the net when you use NFS).  Have
you considered the locking implications? 

If you don't use NFS, then presumably you lock your users onto a single 
CPU server.  All you've done in that case is move the line between server 
and client.  You haven't saved yourself anything.

IMAP does not add overhead; there is nothing that IMAP does that doesn't
have to be done by a mail program in routine operation.  NFS, on the other
hand, *does* add overhead; the bits aren't where they are needed and the
transfer has much less finesse than IMAP.  POP, too, adds overhead (a
full-message transfer) although by itself this is much less costly than
NFS access. 

The bottom line is that yes, a thoughtlessly-configured IMAP
infrastructure is theoretically worse than POP.  It is also true that POP
allows you fewer opportunities to do something stupid.  But I don't
advocate thoughtless configurations. 

In terms of the CPU costs of IMAP, the computer center's IMAP servers
(RS/6000s) ran out of disk I/O bandwidth (due to sendmail queue
processing, not IMAP!), without the slightest hint of running out of CPU
or memory (they use tenex, not mbox format; this saves lots of memory and
disk access).

I have not seen a situation where CPU was the critical resource on an IMAP
server.  Our central systems use a homegrown distributed quota system, so
that is not an issue for us...

IMAP is perfectly capable of operating in the POP model, but Pine does not
currently support that model, except by a side-effect of the mbox driver. 
That is why we have been very hesitant to talk about the POP drivers in
Pine 3.91.

One of our central clusters includes about 24 login servers and 12 IMAP
servers (AIX boxes, I'm not sure what model) to support around 45,000
accounts.  There are also a significant number of PC-Pine users connecting
to those IMAP servers, but I don't have any numbers.  The IMAP servers are
configured for Tenex folders and have no problem with CPU load.

                    ===================

Did you know that your PC, home office, and equipment
may be tax deductible under current tax laws?  This is
true even if you use your PC in very limited business
applications!

Federal tax laws are often confusing and most tax
preparation services do not understand the significant
savings that your investment in office and computing
equipment may qualify you for. 

Based on a legal brief by a prominent Los Angeles tax
attorney for his celebrity clients, this is an easy-to-
read, step-by-step guide to home office tax deductions.  

This write-up is written in plain English and covers all
current tax law.  It is an invaluable aid to legal tax
deductions.

Others have paid hundreds and even thousands of dollars
for this expensive service.  Now you can have this
valuable money-saving information for only $7.95!

With April 15 coming soon, you have no time to lose.  
If you pay U.S. taxes and use a portion of your home 
for business purposes, you need this write-up!

Not with the present level of pine. I suggested it to development and I 
believe its now on the "nice things to do sometime" list.

This has to be a faq, but I can't find it anywhere. Is anyone using ispell
as a spell checker from Pine? I tried using the SPELL environment variable,
but it didn't work, becayse Pine expects to get back a list of mispelled
words, not to hve an external program do all the work.

Is there a way to use ispell?

The default limits in Pine are 200 rows and 170 columns, except in Windows
where the limits are 150 rows and 250 columns...

I have an alias for pine:

alias pine 'shelltool -WG 700x800 -WI ~/pine/pine.icon -WL "Pine 3.91"
-Wx medium ~/bin/pine'

That's alright for me!

Juliet,

	If you use PINE 3.91 and TELNET 2.6, when you tell pine to prYnt 
to ansi it will send it to your local printer.  This is the only 
combination I have found that works (but it does, and Telnet 2.6 is free 
on-line, although you need a SLIP or PPP connection to work it).

				Hope this helps,


				Daniel.

Hi there,
Every time I try to spell check my mails using pine's spell checker, it nags
about all the abbreviations that are present in the mails, eg. internet
addresses, names and so on. Is there any way I may define a custom dictionary,
to stop this nagging?
Thanx in advance.

X-Status: 

In a different group (AIX) I made a contact regarding run away processes
which grab cpu (pine and kermit are the major ones). Here is some
information reprinted with permission.

The author was:
Randolph J. Herber, herber@dcdrjh.fnal.gov, +1 708 840 2966, CD/HQ
(Speaking for myself and not for US, US DOE, FNAL nor URA.)
(Product, trade, or service marks herein belong to their respective
owners.)


The problem of run-away, CPU gobbling orphan processes is frequently
caused by a program starting a process via a remote connection --- rpc,
ftp, rlogin, telnet, etc. --- and then the connection is broken without
properly terminating the program.  IRIX had been having that problem with
FTPD sessions lately.  I have seen it happen with UUCP connections with
many variants of the UNIX operating system until the connection is timed
out by the uucico program (if it has 10 consecutive timeouts (about 10
seconds each) with failures to respond to a request to respond after each
timeout). 

The reason for the effect of the change from ksh to tcsh has to do with
whether or not the child process is placed in its own process group when
it is started.  There are good arguments both for giving a child process
its own process group and for not giving it its own process group.  I
believe that ksh and tcsh have opposite opinions.  The ksh parameter that
controls this behavior is the `set monitor' which can be set the other way
with `set +m'.  The standard default for interactive kshs is `set
monitor'. I was not able to determine the process group behavior of tcsh. 
Most kernel connection support (terminal I/O drivers, TCP/IP, streams,
etc.) send a SIGHUP to the process group of the process that originally
opened the connection --- the login shell most likely.  If the children
are given their own process group, they are protected from the SIGHUP. 
Many systems give immediate, repetitive returns to select(2) when there is
no apparent connection left (I presume that the process would have gone
away if it had received the SIGHUP) and this can easily consume an entire
CPU. 

The problem with killing orphans is that you do not want to kill legal and
legimate orphans.  You would want to generate a list of program names to
check or ignore.

Wierd problem: two printers - one Epson Stylus 800, one Panasonic KX-P1124.
Alternately connected to LPT1 (too cheap to buy switch - I grope around 
and switch the cable).

SUDDENLY THE PANASONIC DOESN'T WORK FROM PINE!

Both work perfectly on other programs, and 'til a few days ago both 
worked fine on PINE. Difference: Panasonic printer doesn't accept data 
quite as fast, takes longer to get file dumped to printer memory.

Symptoms re Panasonic: Very short files usually print OK but anything 
more than a screenful hangs the machine - often in full lockup. Printer 
stops, "printing" message remains on screen. Keystrokes may or may not 
cause printeer to begin acting as though in "log to printer" mode.

All this time the Epson works fine. 

Hardware: 486DX2 66; software Telix 3.22.  Unable to find any 'switch' 
anywhere but I once saw something some where anout xon xoff re printer.

Ideas?  Thanx in advance.

How about using STAT with no argument. If you are not in a group, it
will get an error, and if a group is selected, it will return the
status of the current articles, which can't take much time. Either
way, you get a one line response that doen't generate any error
message on the server.

What for ? Forget binhex and use full MIME encoding. It works nicely with
Macs too ;-)

> Is there a binhex for unix boxes pref sun?

If you really can't live without BinHex, get mcvert for Unix which converts
files from and to BinHex. Then you'll get your BinHex files on your Unix
workstation, and you can even send these BinHexed files to Macs by pasting
them into the body of your outgoing messages (don't use the Attachment feature
of Pine as it uses Base64 encoding)... the BinHex UMAs (like Eudora or LeeMail)
will get them properly as attached Binhexed files.

Have fun !

Okay, I answered my own question.  I now know how to start Pine in an 
xterm and set what its icon should look like:

I start Pine using

	xterm -n Pine -name Pine -title "Pine" -e /usr/local/bin/pine &
                      ^^^^^^^^^^
			this is what tells the window manager what the
			application is called


In my .Xdefaults I have

!
!  This tells the window manager the name of the bitmap to use for the icon
!  -- substitute with the correct window manager name.
Mwm*Pine*iconImage: /user2/stern/.xbm/pine.xbm

!
!  Pine doesn't inherit any of the specific XTerm stuff, so it needs to be
!  defined.
!
Pine*VT100.font:    -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--15-140-*-*-c-*-*-1
Pine*VT100.Geometry:    80x50+10+10
Pine*VT100.saveLines:   0
Pine*jumpScroll:        off
Pine*scrollBar:         off

#ifdef COLOR
        Pine*foreground: White
        Pine*background: DarkSlateGrey
        Pine*cursorColor: Red
        Pine*pointerColor: Blue
#endif



The bitmap I use is attached.  It is a slightly shrunken version of the 
one on the Pine WWW site.

The X resources for window managers are read only when the wm starts, so 
they won't take effect until you restart.

I guess I found at least one of the bugs in pop3 client code. I didn't
do comprehensive testing but at least I don't get the above message
anymore. 

Following is a diff of the necessary change to the pop3.c file
in c-client directory of pine distribution. pop3.oc is is the
original pop3.c in the distribution. This one is for the non-ANSI
pop3.c. The line numbers might be different for the ANSI one.

If you find anything else I would apreciate if let me now.

[And a return key, it would seem.]

You need to buy the TCP/IP Developer's Version.  This is a supplement to 
the TCP/IP runtime (which you already own) hich contains header files and 
libraries and such for compiling TCP/IP programs on your SCO box.

I posted once before, I got zero response.  This is my second request.
I'm using Linux, with PINE 3.90.  There is no "spell" program.  I
can't seem to find one anywhere on the net.  The closest I've come
is "ispell", which is an interactive spell checker, which doesn't
seem to work with PINE very well.  Does anyone know where I can
get the spell program for Linux, or how to make ispell work well
with PINE???  Thanks in advance!!!

I would like to know how I can configure 
pine for UNIX so that the default folder
to save in always is the name of the sender
of the mail I want to save.

Example:
I receive a mail from MrMan@nowhere.edu

When I choose to save it, pine suggests:

SAVE to folder [MrMan] : 

instead of

SAVE to folder [saved-messages] :

PLEASE _e-mail_ me a reply!

Thanks in advance, and have fun out there!

I have experienced some sluggishness with PINE was wondering if it might
be due to the size of the executable.  Our executable is 3MB in size!
Does anyone have a tip on shrinking this any?

My group recently installed Pine on our unix machine, running 
NewBSD.  Pine works fine, but each time any one starts the program
is asks if you want the Pine Document mail to you.

How does one stop this? Or tell Pine that you have seen the message 
once and do not need to see it again?

I just managed to configure PC-Pine to get my mail from my server.
My problem is that:

1)Each time I log in it asks for me to confirm my user ID and then type 
in my password. OK I'm lazy, how can I configure PC-Pine to do this on 
it's own?

2)PC-Pine reads my mail but every time I try to send an e-mail it freezes 
on me and I have to use ALT-CTRL-Delete, what might I have configured wrong?

I'm using PC-Pine 3.91 in Windows 3.1 on a 486dx/33.

Any suggestions greatly appreciated.

TIA
Arash

That is true for berkeley format folders, but not if you use Tenex folders
as we recommend for dedicated mail servers.  The Tenex driver uses much
less memory and is more efficient than the berkeley driver...

Juliet,

	If you use PINE 3.91 and TELNET 2.6, when you tell pine to prYnt 
to ansi it will send it to your local printer.  This is the only 
combination I have found that works (but it does, and Telnet 2.6 is free 
on-line, although you need a SLIP or PPP connection to work it).

				Hope this helps,


				Daniel.

The plain text version (ftp address) has an updated answer to this

This bug fix is correct.

I discovered it independently when re-reading the code in the light of

This is only true if you use the standard unix "bezerk" format.  If you
use "tenex" (mail.txt) format, there is minimal memory usage.  Tenex
format is designed to permit random-access I/O, whereas bezerk needs to do
text rippling and so has to keep another copy the data around.

If you have a standalone server with no user file access from other 
programs, there is no reason not to use tenex format.

In any case, however, these are artifacts of a particular implementation,
and are otherwise unrelated to any differences between POP and IMAP.

Use pine on my shell account and everything is fine.  

When I telnet to my shell account from my (new) ppp account, telnet works 
as it should (vt100 mode, keys and such work right) until I get into 
pine.  IN pine, the screen seems to "drop" a line.  That is, I'll be in 
the inbox with 7 messages.  If I move the cursor to message 5, I see 2 
Lines for #5.

And when I quit pine, all data now scrolls off the last line of the 
screen; in other words, the screen no longer scrolls but rather all data 
spins by on line 24 of the screen.

This only happens when I telnet in.  And only after using pine.  ftp, nn, 
gopher, lynx etc all work as they should.  If I don't use pine things 
work, but using pine means I have to log out and relog back in.

Does this make sense to anyone and is there something I can do to resolve 
this?

Several people have contacted me indicating they have the same problem

If you know who might have the answer or if there is another newsgroup to

  The Pine composer has a very clever way of integrating the mail/news

with the headers, on a news article from a newsreader other than Pine?
I'd like some way to set it up as an editor, so when I reply to a news
article in tin (or in some other newsreader) it fills out the header
part, then tosses me into the editor, and when I'm done creates a very
attractive news message suitable for sending to inews.

  If there's no good way, anybody got any good ideas for a hack? :)

You could always check comp.mail.pine if you wanted to find
out who develops it.

That strikes me as basically unlikely.  Mark Crispin has
advanced the opinion on comp.mail.headers that, instead, all
of the newsreaders which append a "Newsgroups" header to
outgoing mail should be fixed to behave differently.  Thus,
I don't get the impression that we're going to get sane
behavior out of this MUA any time soon.

We are running HPUX9.05 on HP9000 series 755. I noticed that the makefile 
for pine specifically mentions that it is intended for HPUX8. I compiled 
it anyways and it seems to work okay.

I subsequently found and downloaded a copy of the pine suite for HPUX9.01
in binary format from the ftp site. It also seems to work okay. 

Are these differences academic or should I be on the lookout for time bombs 
because of the HPUX version which we are using?

It might be the best I can do, although I don't think it would be
useable to him in that form.  Would be text instead of executable.
Hold on....No, it didn't work.  The Cut command isn't recognized 
when cursor is in header.

Looks like I asked a tough one.

Nope, not quite and that's why Pine is so cool and different. :)
But what were you trying to do with other MUA's anyways?

Since 'kill' filter is not yet avail. in Pine, I believe you are
using someother newsreader perhaps tin?, in which case there's an option
when choosing the kill command as to just mark read, delete, expunge...
so choose the first option that way you can yank them back in as unread.

You can also trash your kill preferences file the location of which again
depends on the newsreader you are using.

Folks,
Recently several of you have asked how email is handled at UW.
Herewith a brief overview of the central email facilities...

-teg

---------------------

As of Feb 1995, UW's central computing service has the following properties:

 o Currently 45,000 user accounts.
 o Unrelenting growth in every dimension.
 o Mail is the most heavily used application.
 o Almost everyone uses Pine, though other mailers are available.
 o Total messages (in + out) on a typical sample day last December: 
   -During 24-hour period: over 215,000 messages handled.
   -During the peak hour: nearly 20,000 messages handled.
 o There are two systems that provide just Pine and information access
   services, and that's where most of the accounts are:
   -a large Sequent multiprocessor.
   -a large cluster of RS6000/AIX machines.

The AIX cluster carries the heaviest load, peaking at about 1300 active
concurrent users (2/95), with that peak number growing lately by >100 each
month.  The cluster includes 12 IMAP servers, although 4 were just added
to accommodate expected growth.  We figure each of these IMAP servers can
handle at least 200 concurrent sessions. 

We also have some smaller departmental clusters using DECstation 5000s, 
with a single IMAP server accommodating roughly 100 concurrent sessions.

Each IMAP server in the main cluster is an RS/6000 model 250 "powerPC" 
with a 80Mhz CPU, 256MB of RAM with two 2GB disk drives.  

Even during very heavy loading these machines are not constrained by CPU
cycles, network bandwidth or memory.  Rather, the bottleneck is seek
bandwidth: the ability of the 2 drives to seek quickly to locate various
users' files and (especially) to create the incoming temporary sendmail
work files.  So more smaller drives would probably work better. 

We are using Tenex format mailboxes, because Tenex is more
memory-efficient than Bky mbox format, and it also permits concurrent
access.  Later this year we plan to develop a C-Client driver for a still
more efficient mailbox format modeled after one designed by CMU for their
IMAP server. 

Mail is vectored to the appropriate IMAP server using a home-grown
database and a modified sendmail on the MX mail forwarders for the
"u.washington.edu" subdomain.  Once it arrives at the designated IMAP
server, mail is delivered directly into pseudo-home directories in order
to facilitate quotas and to avoid having all inboxes in one partition. 
Delivery is done by our "tmail" program, which understands Tenex format
mailboxes, extended "user+folder" addresses, and quota constraints.  There
is a common password file for all the machines in a given cluster, but
users are not permitted to get a login shell on the IMAP servers. 
Eventually we expect to use a single Kerberos authentication database
across all of the central clusters. 

That we have multiple IMAP servers is transparent to Unix Pine users, but
not yet to PC-Pine users.  We intend to implement IMSP to facilitate
automatic server vectoring, but haven't done so yet.  For now, this is
handled for Unix Pine users via a global pine.conf inbox-path entry that
references an environment variable set at login time.  The environment
variable contains the name of the IMAP server for the given user. 
However, PC-Pine users must manually configure the IMAP server name. 

Procmail or other delivery filters are not supported on the IMAP servers,
but we do support extended addresses of the form:

   user+folder@u.washington.edu

Such a message would be placed in the (pre-existing) folder named
"folder", or if such folder did not exist, would be placed in the normal
INBOX. This allows some filtering with cooperating senders... clearly only
a partial solution. There is also a project underway to allow setting up
vacation processing, using email as the method of interaction with the
vacation robot.  It would be nice to generalize this approach to allow
other kinds of delivery processing, but we don't have the resources right
now. 

At the moment, only INBOX (or other incoming message folders) are stored
on the IMAP servers; however, in the future we may reconsider this and
change to storing secondary (saved message) folders on the primary IMAP
servers rather than on the home-directory NFS servers (which also run
imapd so that PC-Pine users can easily get at secondary folders.) We
didn't do this initially because we thought folks might need to access
their folders using tools such as "grep", and not having to export the
folders from the primary IMAP servers via NFS was a plus.  In retrospect,
just using Pine's Export command for cases when the message is needed in
the home directory is probably sufficient for most of our constituency. We
also thought we might want to treat backup of INBOX servers differently
than normal fileservers, or even replicate them, but there are arguments
on the other side.  Using the same IMAP servers for both incoming and
saved-message folders would accommodate some older IMAP clients, such as
Mailstrom, that only know how to copy between folders on the same host,
and it would also be more efficient, since saving messages would be done
locally by the IMAP server, rather than by the client in a two-step
process.  Using the same server for both functions would also simplify
client configuration a bit, and obviate the need for running imapd on the
home-directory servers. 

Notwithstanding the question about where best to store secondary mail
folders, the basic architecture seems very solid and the system appears
to be working quite well.  Still, there is more to be done, and the
environment is still evolving.

Yes it is. One thing to keep in mind tough is that Eudora encode
attachment in AppleDouble or BinHex. I don't know if Pine will be able to
decode them.

At the prompt before starting Pine type the following:

% stty rows ## cols ##

where ## is the approp. number of rows and cols. that you prefer.

 + When you want to save more than one, say, several messages to a folder, is 
 + there a way of "batching" them and sending them all at once into the created
 + folder?  It's kind of time-consuming to do it a message at a time!

First enable the aggregate-command-set option in the Setup/Config screen.
Then use the (;) key to select more than one mail matching certain criteria
and then (A)pply the (S)ave command to save them to the preferred folder.

I've tried both ftp.cac.washington.edu and using the upgrade but both 
times there seems to be something wrong with the pcpine_w.zip (something 
looks wrong with the others too).
The Upgrade say the size of the file should be more that 700KB ( don't 
remember the exact size). But the files on the directory are about 520KB.

Is there anyother site wher one could get PC-PINE?

Thanks

No, but it is improper net-ettiquette not to type in an appropriate
subject in the Subject: header. If one doesn't type any subject at all
only then when you reply to it you will get "Re: your mail" subject line.

This feature has been discussed in comp.risks before, and you've just 
become the latest living proof of how stupid and idiotic it is.

Can someone post the e-mail address of the PINE developers, so that we
can all flame them when this happens?  Maybe if you redirected the hate
mail you've got to THEM, they'd get rid of this ridiculous "feature."

article on Wed, 15 Feb 1995 16:19:58 GMT:

 + I'm using pine3.91 on my linux box and connect with SLIP to my internet 
 + account. I'm also using pop. I keep getting messages from my system 
 + administrator about my mail messages going to him. he said if this 
 + problem isn't rresolved in 48 hours I'll not be able to use pine.
 + My address is mikeh@mordor.com and for some reason replies go to 
 + root@mordor.com. How can I change this to mikeh@mordor.com. The 
 + root@mordor.com address appears when I reply to a newsgroup posting from 
 + pine.

Hmmmm...looks like your From: is set to root@mordor.com

Compose a message, postpone it. Go to the postpone folder and view this
message, check the From: header. If it says root....then you may have to
rebuild Pine again but this time with the ALLOW_EDIT_FROM option enabled.

 + Send email to: listserv@info.cern.ch

This won't work if it just downloads the *.html file, as the gif images,
imagemaps and other graphics will not get downloaded which almost defeats
the purpose of W3.

For ascii based W3 access 'lynx' is a better alternative, otherwise you can
just telnet to the http srever site (port 80) and GET the html file to
the localdrive and then use a browser to view that if access to 'lynx' is not
avail.

You are probably getting this error message which prompts you for Continue
with postponed message? and when you answer Yes, Pine replies back saying
there isin't any message postponed really. If that is the case, then do a
'ls -a' to see if there exists a '.pine-interrupted' file in your home dir.
If it does exist, delete it and then start Pine. This time when you Compose,
and hit 'y' for to resume postponed composition you will have no problems.

Comes here Mr. T. L. Scott with this opinion in the "comp.mail.pine" group in
this article on 16 Feb 1995 22:52:36 GMT:

 + My group recently installed Pine on our unix machine, running 
 + NewBSD.  Pine works fine, but each time any one starts the program
 + is asks if you want the Pine Document mail to you.
 + How does one stop this? Or tell Pine that you have seen the message 
 + once and do not need to see it again?

Pine prompts you this if it doesn't find a '.pinerc' file in the $HOME.
Make sure you retain a copy of .pinerc in the home dir. which will have
the last-version-used=3.90+ entry in it.

almost?? i'd pretty much say it DOES defeat the purpose... pictures, 
sounds, and HOT-LINKS make www what it is....

i'd be tempted to use pine exclusively for email [like i do] and use 
netscape to surf the web...

give up on lynx too... no pix... it WILL get you by... but it's a ford

We're seeing the same problem here (Pine 3.91.SOL, SunSparc Server,

Yes. The free version (1.x) does MIME and BINHEX, the commercial version

The problem with ispell is that it only works with PICO from within PINE. 
I like to use PICO as my default editor in other programs as well so I 
created a custom dictionary for PICO.

Try this:
- spell needs to know the location of the default dictionary. It is usually:
  /usr/dict/hlista
- spell needs two files in your home directory:
  (1) a list of new words to add to your custom dictionary (upper or lower 
      case, it doesn't seem to matter),
  (2) a new hashed version of your custom dictionary. 
- I named mine:
  (1) ispell.words so I can use it for spell & ispell (clever of me), 
  (2) .newhlista
- add the following to your .login:
  setenv SPELL 'spell -d .newhlista'
- Use the following to create a custom dictionary for spell:
  cat [file] | spellin [path to default dict]/hlista > [custom dictionary]
  cat ispell.words | /usr/dict/hlista > .newhlista
When you log off and log back on your new custom dictionary will contain 
your words. Good luck.

Subject: Resorting folders? (surpised by mass saves)
Date: 18 Feb 95 16:16:32 GMT
Message-Id: <ellis.793124192@gmi.edu>
Status: O
X-Status: 

I have been paring down my INBOX (don't ask how big it is).  The ; commands
and apply commands are WONDERFUL!  I can do all sorts of zooms, narrows,
broadens, etc, til I get the messages I want, then I save them into folders
hundreds at a time.

However, I have been surprised by one *feature*:  since my INBOX is sorted
for view by reverse received date, the folders I have created now have my
mail permanently sorted in this order, with the oldest messages last.  I
would much prefer to have the actual order of the messages in the files be
oldest first.  In general I suppose I could do this by changing the sort
criteria before I resaved them, but I would prefer to have fewer steps.  I
also have some folders where I have been aggregating mail from my sent-mail
and INBOX to archive correspondence with some people.  I would like to have
the mail in these interleaved in the order of the correspondence.  Does
anyone know of tools to permanently resort mailboxes?

Thank you.

What version of pine?  On SunOS, using 80x34 xterms, I have the following in
my .login:

eval `/usr/openwin/bin/resize -c`

This sets rows and cols for stty.  You could also do:

stty rows 35 cols 80

at the prompt or in your .login.

You might want to check your manpages.
If you are not using UNIX, then I wouldn't know.

Hi,

	We have lots of users who subscribed to newsgroups and once a week

	there a
	way in pine, to spool the messages in invidual home directories..
	since quota is enabled on the file system, they will be forced to

Nancy:  I am interested in the concept you passed on the internet in 
December.
What I am wondering is if any other offline-readers can also do the same 
as you suggested.  I contacted the Pine group but they stated that pin 
will not work off-line on a 286 system in Dos environment.  I do not use 
windows as yet.  This may happen in the future but not yet.  I am 
exploring several type of offline-readers.  I am told about crosspoint 
but have not gotten that one up yet.  I have had some good pointers from 
one person named Sandy.  Thank you Sandy.
Another concept I have heard about is Blue Wave but I don't know much 
about it.  It may be only for the fido-net concept.
Another one I recently heard about was Werthy which I think will work.  
Not sure.  I believe the designer of this one told me.
I am interested in your further concepts and anyone else's for that matter.
The desire is to download messages and newsgroups messages to my PC 
through appropriate commands after logging onto my account.
Can also a batch file be developed using the commands you suggested from 
the unix prompt?  I may have to experiment with this.
Lenny.

PC_pine gets my mail from the mail server but it won't send any mail it 
just freezes and I have to use ALT-CTRL-DEl to shut it down.
I've used both versions 3.89 and 3.91 in Windows/Winsock.
I've put in the same smtp as in my oder news clients.

If anyone knows where I could get answers to this question please let me 
know.

Thank you

X-Status: 

  For the past several weeks, Pine no longer saves the mail message I'm 
working on when my provider (PrimeNet) has one of its frequent 
disconnects. At least, no "saved" or "postponed" message, appears when I 
hit "Compose" on reaccessing Pine, as it used to.

  I'm sure everyone knows how maddening it is to be near the end of a 
long, complicated letter, and lose it all to a disconnect.

  Can anyone help me to restore the former condition of an automatic "Save?"

  Much thanks,

All the home directories have the .pinerc and those files do have the line:
last-version-used=3.91

However, Pine does no seem to be seeing this file at all and still offering
the ReQuest Document.

Is there anyplace else to look?

Out of 45,000 accounts you *must* have a few people who travel to places
where it is at least a long distance call to get an internet connection.
How do you handle the people who want to quickly download their mailbox
to their notebook machine and work offline?

	I'm not sure if this problem appeared anywhere else, but I know that
the non-PMDF version of Pine-VMS 3.89, when used with a PMDF-equipped
machine and no tcp/ip gets really confused about From: lines, takes the
second word of the "personal name" variable, and puts it in as the userid
for the from line.  Solution?  Change "personal name" to your userid. 
Problem solved. :)  Don't know if this is related to the UNIX problem,
though.

Pine/VMS users will have to use the EXTRACT or PRINT functions to get files
which are readable by WordPerfect, as VMS Mail uses a non-standard
compressed format for mail.

Is there a way to improve the performance of Pine's keyword subject

Hi!

Sorry if I am posting this to the wrong place. but ....

Could someone please tell me the steps to uuencode a binary file (it's a 
.gif to be specific) and then attach it to a pine mail message. I have 
read the cryptic man page on uuencode and tried to follow the directions 
given, but have been unsuccessful.

What I need is a step by step, hold my virtual hand, type of direction.

UNIX and I are grudgingly becoming acquainted, but we are not quite on 
speaking terms yet.

THANKS!

If Pine is not seeing the .pinerc at all, that would certainly explain it.
I gather you've found other settings ignored to verify this hypothesis.

In order to investigate why Pine is not finding the .pinerc file, you 
might use the bug report command (redirecting it to yourself) and look at 
the config data to see what it found and what it didn't find.

True, and not very well (yet).  We even have folks who would like full
disconnected operation, not just offline mode... Both of these are on the
to-do list.

Sorry the trying to compose only if you catch it immediately....My guess 
why it doesn't work a day or so later on our system is that we are running
skulker on the temp files....if you do it immediately it works but not
a day or so later......if you wait and try to get back into it say a day 
later you get a coredump and get kicked out of pine....the only solution
we have been able to come up with was to recreate the problem by going into
compose in pine and force yourself to be kicked off the system by not
proberly logging off...i.e. turning off the computer without logging off
and then immediately go into pine...select compose and agree to go back
to the postponed message.....then cancel it or continue it...
that is our only solution.....
thanks for the ideas though....

I use the following commands on SCO & Sun Unix systems.
	1. cd to your home directory 
  		cd 
	2. copy the .gif file to your home directory
		cp /usr/tmp/your.gif .
	3. compress the file 
		compress your.gif   
		(Note: File name has .Z appended to it)
	4. check permissions on the file & change as necessary
		ls -l your.gif.Z      (to check)
		chmod 666 your.gif.Z  (to change)
	5. uuencode the file
		uuencode your.gif.Z your.gif.Z > encoded.fil 
		(this command creates a file called "encoded.fil"
		 when the file is uudencoded it will be called your.gif.Z)
	6. Start pine
		select c (compose message)
		after entering the To: e-mail address  go to the

You have Mr. Hayes (of modem fame) to thank for this... and it's why the 
keymenu now advertises the SpaceBar as the way to page forward, instead 
of the "+" symbols.

Here's the deal: most "Hayes compatible" modems interpret three 
consecutive "+" characters as a request to interrupt the modem 
connection.  The "OK" you are seeing is coming from your modem.

Solution: use the space bar instead, or leave more time before 
consecutive + characters.

Depending on how fast you "page" through the newsgroups you could be
sending the "+++" command to your modem and causing the modem to go from
data mode to command mode.  The "OK" is the modem waiting for a command.
Next time this happens, try keying in "ATO" <cr> and the modem should go
back online and you should still be in pine.  To stop this from happening,
use the space bar to page.

Hi all,

How can I bounce (NOT forward) all the selection as individual mails to 
another a/c?  I want to bounce my mails to another a/c and reply there.  
If I forward them, they will either become one long mail or a MIME digest 
- this way, I cannot reply them.  I cannot use .forward as well, cuz I'm 
already using procmail which makes use of .forward.

Thank you.

I've seen that a few times, too, with Pine 3.91 running on our SunSparc
Server under Solaris 2.3.  It has happened only a couple of times that I'm
aware of (who knows how many users didn't bother to report it), and I
haven't noticed any pattern to it.  The concatenated messages seem to have
nothing in common other than the fact that their received dates are
consecutive.  I don't know enough about how Pine manipulates the mail file
to say for sure, but if this were one of the old PC or Mac based BBSes I
used to run I would suspect a couple of screwed up start-of-message
pointers (or a failure of the software to recognize them).

I think the Deborah's original request implies that the recipient cannot 
read the MIMEd message, hence the need to uuencode.
I've annotated Brian's message (everyone's an editor, right? <g>)

Not sure why he thinks the gif file in in /usr/tmp.  To generalize:
                cp <source_path>/your.gif .

Make sure you have at least one space between the two "your.gif.Z" names:

At this step, I would ctrl-r the file into the message body, rather than
attaching it.  MIMEing a uuencoded file buys you nothing, since it is
already ASCIIfied.  (Note that the first line of the uuencoded file is
"begin 666 your.gif.Z", so uudecode will know how to name the file, as
Brian mentioned above.

I think Brian meant uudecode first, then uncompress the file.

But in this case, the recipient should 
Option 1 -
 save the message to a file, e.g., message.uu, then execute uudecode: 
     uudecode message.uu
 which will produce a reconstituted your.gif.Z, which is uncopressed
     uncompress your.gif
Option 2 -
 pipe the message to uudecode from the mail program 
     | uudecode
 if your recipient's mail progam supports that.

 + Could someone tell me why my return key acts like a control J.		
 + When I try to create a new paragraph (as such) I must press my down arrow	
 + then my space bar then my down arrow to create same.		If I dare 
 + hit the return key. . . . justification of everything.  argh!		

Hmm...looks like your return key is not mapped right.

stty icrnl

Type that at the prompt and restart Pine and go into Compose mode. See if it
interprets return as ^j.

The man page on stty will give you more information about the settings.

What....?
When you postpone the current composition, it gets saved in the postponed-msgs
folder which is in the users' $HOME and _not_ /tmp. Even if you wipe /tmp every
day (?) clean that shouldn't bother Pine. Unless ofcourse if you have set Pine
to save postponed-msgs in /tmp ?? or am i still completely clueless about
your setup over there?

Comes here Mz. Becky Davidson with this opinion in the "comp.mail.pine" group in
this article on 19 Feb 1995 05:35:21 GMT:

 + Sorry the trying to compose only if you catch it immediately....My guess 
 + why it doesn't work a day or so later on our system is that we are running
 + skulker on the temp files....if you do it immediately it works but not
 + a day or so later......if you wait and try to get back into it say a day 
 + later you get a coredump and get kicked out of pine....the only solution
 + we have been able to come up with was to recreate the problem by going into
 + compose in pine and force yourself to be kicked off the system by not
 + proberly logging off...i.e. turning off the computer without logging off
 + and then immediately go into pine...select compose and agree to go back
 + to the postponed message.....then cancel it or continue it...
 + that is our only solution.....
 + thanks for the ideas though....

 + How can I bounce (NOT forward) all the selection as individual mails to 
 + another a/c?  I want to bounce my mails to another a/c and reply there.  
 + If I forward them, they will either become one long mail or a MIME digest 
 + - this way, I cannot reply them.  I cannot use .forward as well, cuz I'm

Bounce as an aggregate command is not currently available. but since you
are using procmail already why not write a small recipe to do that?
Procmail gurus on the procmail mailing list can help you out on this.

Hmm... looks like you have a pine.conf.fixed file which is what Pine is reading,
instead of $HOME/.pinerc.

Make sure you make appropriate changes to pine.conf.fixed and pine.conf files.

Subject: pine 3.91 hangs when trying to post via NNTP

we experience a hung process when a user tries to POST to usenet. the NNTP
server is defined in the system wide config file, included below.

we wondered what we are doing incorrectly. we have tin for nntp running
correctly, (able to post and read news). we wondered if there was some
'external' component missing or misconfigured perhaps? for example, trn
for nntp also exhibits the same symptoms, (able to read the news server,
but unable to post). this leads  us to belive that perhaps there is a 
missing or misconfigured program for 'news' interaction. 

Q: does pine 3.91 require any externel news software to work correctly for
   posting to usenet via nntp?

   attachments (in-line) ~/.pinerc & /usr/local/lib/pine.conf

                      Thanks in advance,

Another Mac telecomm program that handles Pine's "y" print command 
correctly is the current version of Microphone (Microphone LT, Microphone 
II 5.x, or Microphone Pro 2.x, depending on what bells & whistles you 
want and how deep your pockets are).  VersaTerm Pro is said to print 
correctly, but I've never used it.
 
The most popular Mac telecomm program, Dave Alverson's shareware "Zterm",
doesn't handle printing from Pine correctly, but it's not a complete
waste. When you give the "y" print command, Zterm prints to your screen
rather than to your printer.  You can then scroll back to the beginning,
select the "printed" text, and use Zterm's "Print Selection"  command from
the File menu.  We have a large number of users who are satisfied to do it
that way, because the minor inconvenience is more than offset by the low
$30 shareware fee.  Look for version 1.0b3 (or newer), which now supports
Kermit as well as Xmodem and Zmodem.  It's downloadable from virtually any
BBS, commercial service, or FTP site where Mac is spoken. 
 
Then there is the Macintosh Communications Toolbox, Apple's latest curse
on the telecomm world (preceded by AppleTerm for the Apple II and a long
string of worthless Apple modems).  I've yet to find a Mac telecomm
program that depends on the Apple vt102 CTB tool that will print properly
from Pine, not even to the screen like Zterm at least does.  This means
you can't print from Claris Works, Microsoft Works, and the like, since
they use CTB routines instead of their own telecomm code. 
 
I haven't used White Knight since it was a shareware program called Red 
Ryder (a _long_ time ago), but I'm surprised to hear it doesn't print 
properly.  It's unlike Scott Watson (the creator of RR/WK) to let 
something like that slip by.

Only if the recipient has MIME capability.  The nice thing about BinHex4 
is that it is so ubiquitous in the Mac community.

Any idea where mcvert is available?  I could make good use of it here.  I 
suppose I could search for it, but...  :-)

I've done it.  It's a little more manual than people of clients such as 
Eudora are used to, but it is doable now.

In Pine, that is simply an aggregate save to a local file on the notebook
machine.  Not very automatic, so we don't advertise Pine as an "off-line
client"; you actually have to type 4 characters plus a file name. 

Similar, offline composing of messages is also possible, as long as you 
postpone messages each time (PC-Pine).  In Unix pine on a laptop, you let 
the sendmail on the laptop worry about it.

Generally, I prefer to spring for the long distance phone call unless I'm 
in a airplane (or I can use our INWATS).

For the slim possibility that you're serious, hitting the + key three 
times in a row tells most modems to enter command mode.  To get back to 
the connection you would type "ATO" on a hayes compatible modem.

Hi,
If I want to get a new .newsrc file, with ALL the some 10,000 newsgroup
names available to me on MY system, I:
1) delete MY current .newsrc file with the UNIX command:
              rm .newsrc
2) call 'tin' with the UNIX command:
              tin
3) exit tin IMMEDIATELY and return to the UNIX prompt with tin's  
   'q' command
4) then search & edit the new COMPLETE .newsrc file with the vi-editor:
              vi  .newsrc

On the Internet, the comma is used ONLY as a separator between addresses, it 
has no other possible function.  The solution to Compuserve addresses is to 
replace the comma with a period.  

e.g.  my compuserve id  is    71450,2735
      internet form becomes   71450.2735@compuserve.com
          (note the comma chg'd    ^  to a period)

I was always fond of taking the active file (usualy found in 
/usr/lib/news/active) using the unix command cut to strip off the extra 
data, and then append a ":" to the end of each line.  I forget how I 
added the : to each line, but it should be easy to do using a unix 
command.

Note that you may not have an active file if you use an nntp server.

If you use nntp, you could try telneting to it on port 119, opeining a 
capture buffer (assuming you have one), and issuing the command that 
lists all groups.  You can usualy type help to get a list of commands 
that the nntp server understands.  You will still have to edit the data 
though.

Use a basic editor such as joe or pico to create a text file with the 
forwarding address in it, nothing else. Name the file .forward and save 
it in your home directory. Works for me.

Seems like something that would be easy to automate if you already
have the capability of handling local files.

Somebody has to pay for the wats access, and there is always the case
where you want to grab your mailbox as you leave so you can read
it offline on the plane.  A UQWK/SOUP sort of intermediate batch
file would be nice.  There are other programs to use that method,
but then you have to change interfaces when you connect back to
the network.

  netcom at least should have let you know of the nuglops groups.
  Nuglops is a group of users that make some programs available for
  the rest of the netcom community.

  If you are a netcom subscriber... you can get pine 3.91 by typing
  at your prompt:

  /usr/local/nuglops/bin/pine

  or make an alias 

  alias pine	/usr/local/nuglops/bin/pine

  in your .cshrc file

  btw... to use the newest version of pico... use the same path... 
  /usr/local/nuglops/bin/pico

  or do an alias

  alias pico	/usr/local/nuglops/bin/pico

  also... do read the internal newsgroup: netcom.nuglops.software
  and other netcom newsgroups.

I have a problem building pine-3.91 on Solaris 2.4 Sparc with gcc-2.6.3.

When compiling addrbook.c i get warnings "conflicting type"
for memcpy, strcmp, memcmp, strcmp. These are usually no problem.

But i also get "conflicting type" for rename. And "previous declaration"
which gives a "make: Error 1"

Any ideas ?

  true... but... read the question... instead of "kill", you can
  use select and then zoom.
  use ; (select) then t (text) s (subject) , input the name of the
  subject and then z (zoom)... you will only see articles regarding
  that subject... which is like killing all others...

  Or..if you want to "kill" certain person... use ; t t (to) then
  input the name of the person and then use A (action on selected
  articles) and D (delete)... after that, use X... answer Y(yes)...
  and all articles from that person will "disappear".
  NOt the same than a killfile (is not completely automatic)... but
  handy anyway... 

  (would it be possible to develop a pearl script to act as
  killfile?)

NB - I have done this from pine 3.91 on a sun box to floppy using Export. 
Now the odd bit. When I tried to import it into wordperfect 6.0a, wp said
it needed converting. No suprise there it was a flat file. However wp
insisted it was in wp 4.2 format or something. I said no its a flat ascii
file. Upon loading it was all continuous text with smilies. I tried again
and let wp have its own way and it loaded fine!

One of my users reported a bug in pico, as follows.
===================================================
I've just played with pico. It seems to do some very weird things if you
try navigating round the directories using ^R ^T. In particular, it
doesn't show any files in /tmp, and just a few in /var/tmp.  However,
doing a straight insert quoting the full pathname seems to work.

Trying to use ^R^T on bootes (on e machine on the cluster) just crashed
Pico. 

 Looks like there's a bug there somewhere.
====================================================

This sounds very much like a problem reported recently; was there a fix 
posted?

The following has always worked for me:

To `inc' , either use inc which is a kludge or #MHINBOX (from mh.c) though

  Here are my notes for building on an ss1000 Solaris 2.3.  You should use
the sv4 makefile:

--------- Begin notes..... -----

Turn off DEBUG in the makefile.sv4 for pine 

In pine/headers.h,  move the osdep.h and mail.h include to right after
the stdio include.  This avoids a problem with a different redef of the
rename function.

Set user-domain=your.domain.name in pine.conf.fixed  (Solaris won't get
the FQDN).

In pine/reply.c generate_message-id, use maildomain not hostname

>>> In c-client/tcp_unix.c  (imap/non-ANSI/c-client) init the localhostname to
                         maildomain.  But since this isn't really possible
                         without much grief, hard code the *)&^%#%&^%T*&

You may wish to try my editor JOE (available by anonymous from ftp.std.com,
file: src/editors/joe2.8.tar.Z).  Joe includes 'jpico'- an improved version
of pico.  'jpico' does not have any line length restrictions and has many
other improvements (for example, the row and column number are displayed on
the status line and the paragraph reformatter can handle quoted news
matter).

Well, the inbox is getting pretty large, & while I've figured out how
to deal with individual messages, I'm wondering if  I could just save
the whole thing as a file and start afresh.  Sorry if I'm overlooking
the obvious... Many thanks, Nelson

This sounds a bit like something we've had about three or four times.  

In the index the size of a message was very high, whereas when it was
viewed it was not as long.  An inspection of the mailbox (using vi) showed
that the message being displayed was followed by a number of messages not
in the mailbox.  

If you use vi to edit the mailbox in some way (e.g., by replacing the
first character by itself), the mailbox shrunk in size typically by 160
characters.  I assume that for some reason null characters are in the
mailbox which got removed by the use of vi (but I haven't found a good way
of displaying nulls so I'm not really that sure).  

If they are nulls, then I don't know who is to blame for the null
characters.  BTW, elm seems to see all of the messages.

There is a known bug in Pine 3.91 which Pine's "find next message" code is
confused by the presence of NUL characters in the mailbox.  This bug is fixed
in Pine 3.92, which should be released in the not-too-distant future.

If you want to fix the bug in your own copy of Pine 3.91, get the latest IMAP
toolkit (mail/imap.tar.Z from ftp.cac.washington.edu -- yes, you do want the
3.6-BETA version) and substitute it in place of the 3.5 IMAP toolkit that is
bundled with Pine 3.91.

vi may be truncating messages.  It would be safer to less the mailbox to see
what the end of the message looks like.  If you want to look for nulls, then
od -ac on SunOS will show them, as will emacs I believe.

Have you tried reading your news in Pine?  That seems the easiest.

If not, you could read your news using "gnus" in Emacs, which has even 
_more_ clever ways of inserting the article being replied to.

It seems to me that there used to be a prompt for the alternate editor in 
Pine 3.89, but there isn't now.  In other words, when I hit ^_, I used to 
get something like

	Edit using alternate editor: emacs

with the cursor positioned after the end of the editor name.  I really 
liked this, because it allowed me to switch editors depending on various 
conditions.  It would also be the easiest way to use ispell.

But now I just get automatic insertion into the alternate editor.  This 
seems to go against the principle of Pine asking you whether you want to 
do something unless you explicitly turn that reminder off.

Am I missing some feature setting somewhere?

We have found the following patch against Pine 3.91's pine/ttyin.c to be
effective in dramatically reducing pine loops on our AIX 3.2.5 systems.
Your mileage may vary; this is only one of several modifications to Pine.

We haven't a clue as to why the patch is effective, nor do we care.  We have
examined .pine-debug files ad nauseum, dealt with a trace interface that is
far from friendly to humans, and run pine under a debugger until grey matter
dripped from our earlobes.  In the end, we determined that the SIGHUP handler
appeared to be working while the select/read EOF/error code in ttyin.c
seemed to be getting into trouble.  We therefore bagged the troublesome
code in favor of signals.c's version of a bailout.

This is the single greatest feature of 3.91, IMHO.  Pico is close enough to
jove and emacs to constantly confuse me, and now I can just use jove.  Check
for the setting of the "enable-alternate-editor-implicitly" variable and a
couple of other related ones.

Hi all,

In Pine 3.91 you can flag mails important but what's the use of it?  The 
asterisk looks like the plus sign on my EWAN telnet client and Pine does 
not attempt to stop you from deleting important mails.  Will newer Pine 
ask the user if she really wants to delete an important mail?

All the times are fine except for Date: field.  Its timezone info is set 
to GMT in that field for some reason (-0500 is the East Coast).  The 
system date is fine:
$ date
Mon Feb 20 19:38:25 EST 1995

It is a pain since when elm sorts the messages on my recipients systems it
sorts by the Date: field so they have messages coming in after messages sent
out 3 hours earlier. 

Any ideas on a fix would be greatly appreciated.  I use pine 3.89 under 
Linux with a 1.1.72 kernel.

BTW: It works fine if I use elm or Berkeley Mail to send stuff out.

Thanks

Hi,

I would like to make our email addresses (both *username* and
*domainname*) insensitive to uppercase characters. I mean that I want
to make possible that people use the address Perrot@GRBB.PolyMtl.ca
(for example) instead of perrot@grbb.polymtl.ca.

I make this possible for local adresses (ex : Perrot instead of
perrot) by removing the 'u' F flag in the line below :

#Mlocal, P=/bin/mail, F=EDFMlsmu, S=10, R=20, A=mail -s -d $u
Mlocal, P=/bin/mail, F=EDFMlsm, S=10, R=20, A=mail -s -d $u

I tried to modify the Mether line without success :

#Mether, P=[IPC], F=mDFMXCu, S=11, R=21, E=\r\n, A=IPC $h
Mether, P=[IPC], F=mDFMXC, S=11, R=21, E=\r\n, A=IPC $h

Any idea about that ?			  

Thanks in advance.		Gildas.

He everyone!

Does anyone know if there is a way to get pine to save messages with the
newest message at the front instead of appending them to the end of a
mailbox file?

Thanks!

Hi everyone!

I noticed that PINE was not putting "Distribution:" headers in news articles.
Thinking this might be a problem, I noticed that _many_ people do not
use "Distribution:" headers.  Is this an obsolete header line or is
"world" the default when one is not otherwise specified?

Thanks!

	I also have elm 2.4 installed and it is working perfectly.
	That leads me to believe the problem is not with DNS or
	sendmail.  I am an inexperienced, and rusty, C programmer and
	therefore am concerned that I may have missed something when
	I compiled pine.

	I have read the technical notes, have run pine at debug level 9,
	and have been unsuccessful in tracking the problem.  If anyone
	has any ideas, I would really appreciate the help.  Thank you in
	advance...

Status: O
X-Status: 

I am testing a copy of Pine 3.91 compiled for SCO Unix.  I'm having a small 
problem with the menu at the bottom of the screen.  When moving to 
the edit mode (such as picking 'C' from the main menu) the screen seems 
to switch to 24-line mode.  Whatever text had been drawn on the bottom 
(25th) line remains visible, and the current menu is drawn on the 23rd 
and 24th lines.  Doing a screen refresh (^L) doesn't fix the problem.  
Leaving edit mode does fix it.

Running Pico from the command line shows the same thing -- it uses only 24 
lines of the available 25.  This isn't a problem from the command line, of
course.

I've tested this on the console and on a terminal emulator (TinyTerm 
Plus) in SCO-ANSI and VT-100 modes.  The problem exists on the console 
and the emulated ANSI, but NOT the VT-100 mode.  I'm running SCO Open 
Server 3.0.0.  I'm using the stock termcap and terminfo descriptions for 
ansi and vt100 as delivered by SCO.

Is there a configuration switch for Pico I've missed?

Hi,

	I was wondering if I might find some help here.  I am using PINE
3.91 on an RS600 system (AIX V3). 

	I run a mailing list where I am continually "taking" addresses to
distribution lists.  My problem is as follows: 

	When the mail is addressed to <listname>-request (like it's
supposed to be) or anything besides my own address) I can "take" the
address using list mode ('L'). This will allow me to take the address and
add it to the end of a distribution list. 

	However, when someone uses *my* address, I cannot use the list
mode.  Is there anyway around this? 

	At present I have to cut and paste those addresses into my
addressbook, and it wastes so much time.  Responses via mail would be
greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance for your help. :)

ARRGH!

I just subscribed to the procmail list and requested the best_of... 
archive dump.  I got a message back with the above subject, but the data 
was attached with a "[ Part 1: "Included Message" ] separator.  When I 
tried to view the message in Pine, I got a Pine bug error and got dumped 
out of Pine.  I also got a 9MB core dump. 

Question is, how do I read the enclosed message?

it appears as personal mail. Today I got a message that was personal, but 
didn't have the + beside it. How does pine decide what gets a + and what

I'm trying to compile the Washington  IMAP distribution for Linux from
sunsite.  It dies looking for lib shadow.  What is it?  Where can I find
it?  What does it imply?  I can't find any documentation on it.

Thanks for any help or pointers.

Note that this method will only work if your sys admin has set tin
up to subscribe to all groups if there is no .newsrc.   Some sys
admins set things up so that the default is to subscribe you to
only local newsgroups and newuser newsgroups.  I think there is a
way to subscribe to everything from within tin - it involves using
y to yank in all newsgroups.  Maybe a tin user could post the 
instructions...

You're on the right track.

At the newsgroup level, hit 'y' to yank in all news groups.
Then use the 'S' command to subscribe  to all groups matching a pattern
which you'll then be prompted for.  To subscribe to everything, use *
Or limit to a hierarchy such as news.*

The only problem with this method is speed.  ( A big problem ).  It will
say "subscribing to xxx.xxx.xxx " slow enough to see each name!  It'll 
take quite a while for 10000 groups!  This is probably best used to
subscribe to a subset of groups.

Subject: Mail goes to News server in PINE 3.91 for Windows.  WHY?
Status: O
X-Status: 

Several users at our site have had a recurring problem where PINE 3.91
for Windows tries to post a mail message they're sending to a news server
instead of smtp-server, even if nntp-server, news-collections etc. are
blank.  If they keep retrying, the message is eventually SMTP'd, but
they have to retry (CTRL-X again) dozens of times.  As one might
imagine, these users are quite frustrated.

Can someone suggest how we can eliminate this problem?

Thanks,

Pine does understand #MHINBOX, e.g.

libshadow is the Linux code that handles shadow passwords.  Since this is 
standard in Linux, you may want to investigate why your Linux 
installation is incomplete.  I am not a Linux expert, so I can not

The official location of the IMAP distribution is on 
ftp.cac.washington.edu.  Any other locations may have out of date versions.

I would like to use to invoke pine for the sole purpose of reading/posting
to precisely one newsgroup (in any one invocation); upon starting up pine I
want to go direct to the newsgroup list, avoiding ALL the normal
intervening menus. (For example "nn comp.mail.pine" will do this via the
reader nn.)  How is this done with pine (v3.91)?  

The command "pine -f comp.mail.pine" does not work, cause it then tries to
read comp.mail.pine as a mail folder which it is not.

X-Status: 

I've read through the posts here and didn't see anything like my problem.

	I'm toying with PC-Pine 3.91 running with Trumpet Winsock for MS
Windblows 3.1.  As far as I can tell, I've gotten all the parameters of the
setup file set correctly.  (This could obviously be wrong...)

	I've got it set up so that when I go into the folder list, one
is for incoming email (INBOX on my Unix mainframe server where my account is),
one for saved messages on a different filesystem on that mainframe, one
set for locally (My IBM's hard drive) saved email, and one for my Net News
groups.
	When I go to get an expanded list of my remote saving directory, it
just flashes like it went to get it and it failed.  Yet that directory is my
default for saved messages, and it saves mail to the files in that directory
with no problem.
	A friend of mine in CS suggested that it could be a file permission
problem, but after some toying around I've ruled that out.  What else could
it be???

	Also, and this is of lower importance, why is it that my INBOX can
be listed with the rest of my saved-mail folders when I run pine on my unix
account?  I don't understand how that's done...maybe with more time I can
figure that one out, but the first problem has got me completely stumped...

Thanks in advance for your help.

might not be setup correctly? The default printer seems to be 
attach-to-ansi but I don't want that.


Thanks

Here's hoping that the only stupid question is one you do not ask.  When 
I reply to messages in news groups using pc pine version 3.91, it seems 
to put my reply above the quoted message.  How can I change it so that 
the quoted message appears first, then my reply?  I do not have this 
problem when I send mail.  Thanks for your time and help.

I've seen variations of this problem on every major unix platform -
hpux, ultrix, osf, aix, solaris . . . . Curses programs seem
particularly prone to it - tin and lynx (especially lynx) are both
problems for me - a user drops carrier or otherwise terminates
incorrectly and these programs run wild. Pine does this occasionally
under hpux and ultrix . . . perhaps once out of 27000 * 30 invocations
per month (on our primary mail host running hpux 9.04). Shell scripts
can also evince this behavior. I've seen sh scripts that have lost their
controlling tty and promptly eat the machine on which they're running.

Anyone dipped into the source yet to figure out what's going on ? I keep
pushing that job down to the "not very interesting" part of my list :)

I'm re-sending this, as I'm not sure it went out the first time.
Apologies if this is a repeat.

We have a couple of PINE-3.91 for Windows users who are having a
frequent problem whereby PINE tries to post mail messages that they're
try to send, to a news-server instead of the smtp-server.  The posts fail;
nntp-server and news-collections are not even set for these users.  If
they keep doing CTRL-X enough times, the message finally goes through.
Each failure results in an error message that the message can't be
posted to the news server, and in several seconds of delay.

Can someone suggest a fix or workaround for this, or tell us what we're
doing wrong?

Thanks in advance for any info.

Malcolm

I DON'T want to have the editor explicitly defined.  That way, when pressing
^_ in Compose, I am prompted for my alternate editor with whatever is in the
EDITOR variable.

In other words, on your [S]etup, [C]onfig page, make sure the options look like

				[...]

            [X]  enable-alternate-editor-cmd

In (S)etup - (C)onfig you can set the feature

	enable-alternate-editor-cmd

If depends on whether you specified the alternate editor in the environment

  If you're using one for the UNIX, the following will work. For PC's
  I don't know.

  Try the following:

  1. From the Main Menu choose "S".
  2. Choose "P" for printer.
  3. Choose "3" to set the print command for example "lp -Plw12"
  4. Save the configuration and come back to index.

  To print a message:

  1. Choose "O" for "other commands and "Y" to print the message.

  You can also use "2" in the "Printer" Menu and set "PRINTER"
  and "LPDEST" variable in the shell. I guess you're smart enough
  to figure it out.

Note however that if Pico splits the References line at white space,
and starts the second thru nth line with white space, that the lines
need not be joined back together - that's a legit format for a news

I've seen this too.  In most cases it can be reduced to one or more of
these problems:

 The modem is connected to a logical device which doesn't send SIGHUP
 to processes associated with it when carrier is lost.

 The processes are ignoring SIGHUP.

 The modem is configured to force DCD high.

 The driver is configured to force DCD high.

It seems to me that there used to be a prompt for the alternate editor in 
Pine 3.89, but there isn't now.  In other words, when I hit ^_, I used to 
get something like

	Edit using alternate editor: emacs

with the cursor positioned after the end of the editor name.  I really 
liked this, because it allowed me to switch editors depending on various 
conditions.  It would also be the easiest way to use ispell.

But now I just get automatic insertion into the alternate editor.  This 
seems to go against the principle of Pine asking you whether you want to 
do something unless you explicitly turn that reminder off.

Am I missing some feature setting somewhere?

inbox.  It won't even let me make a new folder.  What could I have done.
I have saved sooooo much good information in there and now it all gone.
 I posted a survey and all of the responses to it are gone.  All my listserv
information is gone.  Everything except my current inbox has vanished.
Even my sent mail is gone...Everything...Vaporized into

Please...can someone help me?????  Can you read my panic???? Thanks for

Pine 3.92 will have provisions to filter incoming and outgoing messages
through PGP, or whatever.  In the mean time, take a look at the mkpgp
script that is mentioned here occasionally...

When my server changed to the new Pine 3.9 something happened 
that changed my ability to capture text and print it out properly.  
I used to be able (using CrossTalk) to capture a file, transfer 
it to Word Perfect and print it.  It would automatically convert from 
Ascii to a readable format and would print perfectly.  Now I get 
something called IA5 which my WP doesn't seem to be able to convert.  
Is this something in the new Pine program and, if so, is there 
anything I can do about it.  I am not familiar with programming 
language, so please keep suggestions in English and for the 
technically incapacitated.  Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks

Distribution: headers aren't obsolete, but they do rely on properly
configured (and well-placed) news-sites to enforce them. If one isn't
specified, "world" is the default.

We're experencing some problems with Pine 3.91 here and I was wondering whether
anyone else has had the same error.

The problem is this:

If (using stty) the number of rows is set to something other than 0, and the
number of columns is set to anything greater than 257, then when someone tries to
Compose, Reply, Forward, etc, Pine quits with a 'Bug in Pine detected: "Received
abort signal"' error.

(BTW, the large column values aren't set deliberately, they probably only appear
 because of comms problems.)

Did you change your folder-collections directory?  The default is

	folder-collections	mail/[]

If you change this then Pine will get confused as to what directory tree 
your folders are stored in...

How do I uudecode something from Pine?  (I know, I know, stupid

	Boy, don't I feel stupid.  I should have looked around a little

Hello Pine-Info:

I have what is probably a stupid question; I want the prYnt command to 
print to standard unix printer (lpr) by default, for *ALL* users on my 
system.  What do I do?

Also, I want to set up an account that will do nothing but forward mail
to other accounts.  Does anyone know if I can have multiple addresses in
my .forward file?


Thanks!!

I hope someone out there can help me with this request.

Having just downloaded Pine and PCpine, I am now wanting to get them
to talk to each other.

Pine in running under Hp-ux 9.04 and I am able to send messages OK 
between users on the machine. I now want to add my PC. Can someone
please advice me a quick way to configure the system and get it up
and running as I'm left a little confused by the documentation.

I am running FTP PC TCP/IP version 3.0 under a dos environment which
is configured to, and does, talk to the host where Pine is sat.

Many thanks.

I figure that there are so many folks out there using Pine with so many 
different configurations that one of you will be able to answer a 
question aobut IP products.

We are currenlty experimenting with a dial-up connection using a 'Shiva 
box'.  When we log in, the Shiva box assigns an IP address for that session.

We are using an MS TCP/IP product, which requires that the user update the
IP address each time we log in to match the IP address assigned by the
Shiva box. 

Does anyone know of an IP product that will recognize and use the 
Shiva-assigned address automagically?


TIA,

  [ Part 3.1: "What is Pine?" ]

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is Pine?

Pine(tm) --a Program for Internet News & Email-- is a tool for reading,
sending, and managing electronic messages.  It was designed specifically
with novice computer users in mind, but can be tailored to accommodate the
needs of power users as well.  Pine uses Internet message protocols
(e.g. RFC822, SMTP, MIME, IMAP, and NNTP) and runs on Unix, MS-DOS, and
MS Windows. 
  
The guiding principles for Pine's user-interface were:  careful limitation
of features, one-character mnemonic commands, always-present command
menus, immediate user feedback, and high tolerance for user mistakes.  It
is intended that Pine can be learned by exploration rather than reading
manuals.  It has the ability to perform full screen editing of messages,
include and extract attachments (such as Word or Excel files), and other
advanced message system features. 

Pine uses IMAP for accessing message folders on remote computers and MIME
for sending multimedia or other binary files as attachments to normal
messages. 

  [ Part 3.2: "What is MIME?" ]

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is MIME?

MIME (RFC1521) stands for "Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions". It is
an Internet standard which allows transfer of binary files
(word-processing documents, spreadsheets, images, sounds, etc) between any
compliant mailers. You can get technical information about MIME from the
RFC. Ongoing discussion on MIME takes place in the newsgroup
comp.mail.mime. There is also a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) list that
is posted regularly to comp.mail.mime, comp.answers and news.answers. 
If you have a Web browser you can access it through:

http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/bngusenet/comp/mail/mime/top.html

  [ Part 3.3: "What is IMAP?" ]

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is IMAP?

IMAP stands for "Internet Message Access Protocol". An IMAP client program
on any platform at any location on the Internet can access email folders
on an IMAP server. While the messages appear to be local, they reside on
the server until the client explicitly moves or deletes them.  The IMAP
protocol is a functional (but incompatible) superset of POP. A principal
advantage of IMAP over POP is that it permits using more than one computer
to access your mail.  Using multiple computers with POP typically results
in your mail ending up scattered across all of those computers. Another
key advantage is IMAP's ability to selectively access parts of messages,
e.g. you don't have to wait for a 2MB audio attachment to be retrieved
until you specifically ask for it.  This is a big win over low-speed (e.g.
dialup) connections.  For a detailed comparison of IMAP and POP, see the
paper "Comparing Two Approaches to Remote Mailbox Access: IMAP vs. POP." 
It is available from: 

	ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap.vs.pop
  
IMAP is what allows Pine (or any other IMAP client) to access email on a
remote mail server, usually one that is shared (central or departmental). 
The current IMAP4 Proposed Standard is described in RFC1730.  Additional
information is included in RFC1731, RFC1732, and RFC1733. 

  [ Part 3.4: "How can I get a copy of Pine?" ]

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: How can I get a copy of Pine?

Pine is available via anonymous ftp from the pine directory of
ftp.cac.washington.edu. 

  [ Part 3.5: "What documentation is available?" ]

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What documentation is available?

The Pine program itself includes extensive online help.  Additional
documentation may be found via anonymous FTP or via World-Wide-Web at the
following locations: 

  ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs
  http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine

The following contributed documentation is also available:

  http://www.math.utah.edu/~calfeld/creations/ca_pine_guide.html
  http://www.math.utah.edu/~calfeld/creations/PineIntroduction
  http://www.math.utah.edu/~calfeld/creations/PineIntermediate

If you have documentation that you would like to share, please mail
pine@cac.washington.edu a pointer to them and we'll include it here. 
   
  [ Part 3.6: "What mailing lists and newsgroups are there dealing wit" ]

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What mailing lists and newsgroups are there dealing with Pine?

The "comp.mail.pine" newsgroup is devoted to Pine.  It is bi-directionally
gatewayed to the "pine-info" mailing list described below. 

   The following mailing lists deal with Pine and related topics: 
   
   Pine-Info@cac.washington.edu 
          Pine-Info is a mailing list for the email program Pine. The
          mailing list includes discussion of Pine features, bugs,
          tricks, etc. Often technical and installation questions appear
          on the list. New releases, fixes and version of Pine are
          announced on the pine-info mailing list.  For official 
          announcements only, you may wish to see pine-announce instead 
          of this list.
          
          To subscribe to pine-info, send a message to
          majordomo@cac.washington.edu with 
                  subscribe pine-info
 	  in the body of the message.
          
          Owners of this mailing list can be contacted at
          owner-pine-info@cac.washington.edu. 
          
   Pine-Announce@cac.washington.edu 
          Pine-Announce is a announcement list for the email program
          Pine. When new Pine products are released and old ones updated,
          a message goes out to this group describing the development. It
          is a very low volume list and includes no discussion
          whatsoever.
          
          NOTE: All messages to this list are automatically forwarded to
          pine-info, so it is not necessary to subscribe to both lists!
          
          To subscribe to pine-announce, send a message to
          majordomo@cac.washington.edu with 
                  subscribe pine-announce
	  in the body of the message.
          
          Owners of this mailing list can be contacted at
          owner-pine-announce@cac.washington.edu.

  [ Part 3.7: "How many sites use Pine?" ]

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: How many sites use Pine?

Based on the number of people getting copies of Pine and its
documentation, we know for sure that Pine is used at over 12,000 sites in
60 different countries.  We do not have any way to count the exact number
of sites using Pine or the total number of users, but we estimate that 
well over one million people use Pine right now (12/94).  People are still
jumping on the Pine bandwagon -- about 4,000 new users each day -- so any
guess about the number of people who use Pine today will surely be too
small tomorrow.

  [ Part 4.1: "Why doesn't Pine's cancel/postpone/etc key work?" ]

On some systems, certain control characters are intercepted before they
get to Pine.  This is usually a problem with the communication software
running on a Mac or PC, but terminal servers sometimes intercept certain
control characters as well.

Control-C and Control-O seem to be two of the most common problem cases.
As a work-around, you can press the ESCAPE key twice followed by the
desired key.  For example, if Control-O (^O) does not work on your system,
try typing "ESC ESC O".  This trick will work for any control character.

Put addresses and/or list from your address book in the Bcc: (blind carbon
copy) header field. You will see all the names and addresses as you
compose the message, but they are erased before arriving in other people's
INBOXes. The Bcc: header is not displayed automatically in the default
Pine configuration, so you may need to use the rich headers command
(Ctrl-R) while the cursor is in the header to expose it. 
   
  [ Part 4.3: "How do I use Ispell with Pine and Pico?" ]

From: Mike Ramey <mramey@u.washington.edu>, Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: How do I use Ispell with Pine and Pico?

If you use ispell and have an ispell custom dictionary (usually ispell.words
or .ispell_words in your home directory, which contains a list of words, one 
word to a line) then it is nice to also use ispell for spell checking your 
outgoing mail messages.  There are two methods for setting this up.  

METHOD 1
========
If you always use Pine's default composer, Pico, then you can use ispell
as your "alternate editor."  In your .pinerc set enable-alternate-editor
and set the editor variable like this:

   editor=/usr/local/bin/ispell

(See step 1 of Method 2 below for instruction for finding the full path
to ispell on your machine.)

Then, when you are composing a message you can type ^_ to run ispell on your 
message and display the output in Pine's viewer.  In the viewer you can use
ispell's usual commands. While in ispell you can type ? for help on  ipell's 
commands.  One useful command is ``I'' which inserts the current word in your 
custom dictionary.


METHOD 2
========
If you use an alternate editor, such as vi or emacs, then you need to fool 
Pine into thinking that ispell is spell.  Here's how to set this up:

1] Determine what directory ispell is in by using one of these commands:

     which ispell
     type ispell
     whereis ispell
     where ispell

2] In your bin directory, e.g., $HOME/bin, link spell to ispell with:

     ln -s /usr/local/bin/ispell $HOME/bin/spell

   Replace ``/usr/local/bin'' with ispell's path (see #1).


3] If you use the csh or tcsh set the SPELL environment variable by
   putting a line like this in your .cshrc:

     setenv SPELL "$HOME/bin/spell"

   If you use the Bourne shell set the SPELL environment variable by
   putting a line like this in your .profile:

     SPELL="$HOME/bin/spell"
     export SPELL

4] In your home directory create a file called ispell.words that
   contains your private dictionary of words that should pass the
   spell check.  This will probably include your name, email address, etc.

5] Logout and log back in to make sure that your new settings are in
   place.

6] Test that this is set up correctly by using Pine to compose a message
   and include words, like your name,  that are in your custom dictionary.  
   Spellcheck the message with ^T.  If your name passes the spellcheck (and
   your name isn't in regular dictionaries) then it is set up correctly.

With Method 2 you cannot use many of ispell's features, for example, ``I'',
which inserts a word in your dictionary doesn't work.

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: How can I have a signature automatically appended to my mail messages?


Using your favorite text editor (e.g. Pico), create a file in your home

  [ Part 4.5: "How can I filter messages into different incoming folde" ]

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>, Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: How can I filter messages into different incoming folders?

                                       

Pine does not do delivery filtering. That function is done by other
programs, such as "procmail" or "filter" or "deliver" or "mailagent." 
   
Once you have set-up your delivery filtering, e.g. via the "procmail"
program, then you will have new mail arriving in several different
mailboxes/folders, in addition to your INBOX. 
   
So then the question becomes, how do you access those new "incoming
message" folders that your favorite delivery filter program has created?

One solution is to just access them the same way you access your other
mail folders.  If they are in your default folder directory (usually
$HOME/mail) then just type L to list your folders and select the folder
you'd like to view.  If they are in a different directory, for example
$HOME/mail/IN, add that directory to your folder-collections by putting
this into your .pinerc: 

folder-collections=mail/[],
        mail/IN/[],

And then when you list your folders by typing L the mail/IN directory will
be in your list. 

Another solution is to use Pine's incoming-folders variable.  With this
method you can use the Tab key to tab through new messages in all your
incoming folders.  When you are at the last new message in one incoming
folder pressing the Tab key will move you to the next incoming folder with
a new message. 

Here is part of a sample .pinerc for setting up incoming folders: 
 
incoming-folders=Art151           {warhol.art.nowhere.edu}IN/art151,
                 Art-L            {warhol.art.nowhere.edu}IN/Art-L,
                 Old-Student-Acct {fozzie.elsewhere.edu}INBOX

In this case, the pinerc entries presume that your delivery filtering
program has been configured to put mail relating to the Art151 class into
the folder "IN/art151" and mail relating to the Art-L mailing list into
"IN/Art-L". 
   
>From the Folders List screen, you can then easily access those folders.
Eventually we will have a way to indicate which of these may have new mail
waiting for you, so that you don't forget that you have more than one
place to look for new mail.

  [ Part 4.6: "How do I define my own headers like Reply-To and Organi" ]

From: Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: How do I define my own headers like Reply-To and Organization?

                                       

In Pine 3.90, and later versions, you can set Reply-To, Organization,
and other headers using the customized-hdrs variable.

1. From the Main Menu type s for Setup
2. Type c for Configuration
3. To change the value of the customized-hdrs variable:
   a) To use the Where command type: w
   b) At the prompt type: customized-hdrs
   c) To Add a value type: a
   d) At the prompt type: Organization: Your Organization Name
   e) Repeat steps c and d for other headers such ast Reply-To

   Note that Pine understands environment variables so you
   can use lines like the following (if the variables are set):
      Organization: $ORGANIZATION
      Reply-To: $REPLYTO

While reading a message that you've received you can view all headers by 
typing h.  If h does not work you need to go to your configuration menu and 
set the enable-full-header-cmd variable.

While composing a message you can view all the headers by placing the cursor
in the header region and typing ^R (view rich headers).

Customized headers are not available in Pine 3.89 and earlier.

There are currently two ways to force a new mail check. 
     * Press `Ctrl-L' (Refresh Display). 
     * At the last message in a folder, press 'N' 4-5 times. 
       
   
   
  [ Part 4.9: "How can I read a ROT13 encoded message?" ]

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: How can I read a ROT13 encoded message?

                                       

When viewing the message, use the '|' (Pipe) command and give it the
following: 

        tr '[A-Za-z]' '[N-ZA-Mn-za-m]'

You could also write a script, maybe called unrot, that does this and then
pipe the message to the script. 

In order for the pipe command to work you need to be using Pine 3.90 or 
higher and have the enable-unix-pipe-cmd variable set.

  [ Part 4.10: "Can I eliminate the @host.domain from local addresses?" ]

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Can I eliminate the @host.domain from local addresses?

This is not a new idea.  It's a very old idea, in fact, and just about
everyone who has ever dealt with email has had it at one time or another. 
Regretably, it has come to be recognized as a bad idea.  Here's why: 

An email address without a host name is not syntactically valid according
to RFC822.  Now, it is true that RFC822 only specifies what must be done
in messages which are transmitted over the network, and that strictly
local messages are not under RFC822's dictates. 

This means that there are two formats of email, one that conforms to
RFC822 and one that does not.  Careful efforts must be made to ensure that
the non-conforming mail format never escapes the local system onto the
network. Twenty years' of experience has shown that it is impossible to
guarantee that the non-conforming format does not escape into the network,
even in the face of traps to catch such messages on their way out and
convert them to RFC822 conforming format.  Indeed, such traps have often
contributed additional problems on their own. 

The non-conforming format is ambiguous as to what host is intended.
Although the off-the-cuff solution (and the one that everyone implements)
is ``use the local host'', numerous examples have occurred in which this
leads to wrong behavior.  For example, it may be the ``local mail center''
instead of the ``local machine which is a single-user workstation''.  Or,
if a one of the non-conforming messages escaped on to the network, it's
some remote system and we have no idea at all what system that may be! 
There's no way for the mail reader to tell; a human may infer from context
but often does so by using information that is not available to the
program. 

The Pine team has spent long (and at times heated) meetings reviewing this
issue, before coming to the conclusion (as other email groups have
independently done) that it's a no-win situation.  The policy of the email
development community for 15 years (since the RFC733 discussions) has been
to exterminate the non-conforming format by not implementing it in modern
mail tools. 

It may be feasible to implement a feature in a future version of Pine that
would suppress the display of the local host name in email addresses. That
is, the host name would still be in the file on disk, but would not show
up on the screen.  We'll consider it, but we have a large list of very
high priority tasks which must be done first. 
 
  [ Part 5.1: "Why doesn't "attached-to-ansi" printing work?" ]

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject:  Why doesn't "attached-to-ansi" printing work?

So-called "attached-to-ansi" printing relies on the communication software
you are using to interpret certain special characater sequences that tell
it to divert the incoming stream of characters to your printer, and then
back to your screen.  Perhaps 99% of "pine printing problems" are either
due to PC or Mac communications software that doesn't understand ANSI
escape sequences for printing, *or* (in the dialin case) softare flow-
control problems. 

We didn't understand how big a problem software flow control was 
until 3.90 came out... we changed pine to intercept flow control 
characters so that users would not see Pine "wedge" mysteriously if a 
mis-type or noise generated a control-S, but that did bad things when 
printers, modems, or comm software was depending on s/w flow control.

So in 3.91 we added the "preserve-start-stop-characters" feature, so that
Pine could be configured to respect s/w flow control characters (if the
operating system did) for those folks who needed them.  Enabling this feature
should make Pine 3.91 behave the same way as earlier versions. 

Then we discovered that some operating systems don't enable software flow
control by default.  So in 3.92, the "preserve-start-stop-characters" 
feature will do more than simply "not ignoring" them, it will try to force
the OS to pay attention to them.

So here's the sequence of things to try if you have pine printing 
problems:

 1. CHECK FOR SOFTWARE FLOW-CONTROL PROBLEMS:
    A. Try enabling "preserve-start-stop-characters"  <- requires 3.91
    B. If that doesn't help, verify that the OS is enabling s/w flow
       control; if it isn't, you can either change that in a global 
       .login script, or as a worst case, wrap pine in a script that does 
       it.  By the way, on our AIX systems, we had to execute "stty -ixon"
       followed by "stty ixon" --no one here knows why the first stty
       is needed.  (Note that explicitly enabling s/w flow control in the OS 
       will not be needed in 3.92).
    C. If neither of the above apply, double-check that you actually have
       *some* kind of flow control enabled on your system, either hardware
       or software.
 2. CHECK YOUR COMM SOFTWARE FOR ANSI PRINTING CAPABILITY
    A. After ruling out s/w flow control problems, if printing still 
       doesn't work, the odds are that the PC or Mac comm s/w is at fault.
       I don't know how to determine this other than via trial-and-error
       and word-of-mouth.  
    B. The "ansiprt" utility included in the pine distribution can also 
       be used for testing.  It simply sends the specified text file to 
       user's terminal device, bracketed with the ANSI escape sequences 
       for print diversion.  This is just what Pine does as well (although
       some versions of ansiprt offer a few options not available via Pine.)
 3. POSSIBLE OTHER PRINTING PROBLEMS
    A. Printing via Pine's "attached-to-ansi" facility to a postscript-only
       printer.  Pine does not yet have the ability to encapsulate text
       into postscript, ala "enscript", so the custom print option using 
       enscript and ansiprt will be needed in that case.
    B. Other printer-specific configuration problems.  For example, 
       whether or not the printer needs a trailing formfeed to eject the 
       last page, or a control-D, or non-Unix newline conventions, etc.
       Many of these problem will also require using the custom print 
       command option and "ansiprt".

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: How do I read News with Pine?


Beginning with version 3.91, it is usually sufficient to set the
nntp-server variable, via the Setup/Config menu. This will automatically 
define a default news-collection.  In case the default is not appropriate 
for your site, the following details may help...

Three ways to access news via Pine: 

    1. Via NNTP. Your .newsrc file must be on the machine where Pine is
       running. Assuming news is stored on the machine news.nowhere.edu,
       a typical .pinerc entry would be: 
       
           news-collections = News *{news.nowhere.edu/nntp}[*]
   
       Note that if the nntp-server variable is set, your
       news-collections will default to NNTP access from that same server.
       

    2. Via IMAP. Your .newsrc file must be on the machine where news is
       stored. Assuming news is stored on the machine news.nowhere.edu, a
       typical .pinerc entry would be: 
       
           news-collections = News *{news.nowhere.edu}[*]


    3. Local News. If news is stored on the same machine you run Pine on,
       you can specify: 
       
           news-collections = News *[*]


The advantage of IMAP newsreading is that the same .newsrc can be used for
both Unix Pine and PC-Pine. The disadvantage is that you must have an
account on the machine that stores the news and runs the NNTP server.

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Why does Pine encode text attachments?


Pine uses MIME's Base64 encoding for *all* attachments, including text, in
order to assure that they are not modified in transit. The goal is make
sure that sending file attachments in Pine is as dependable as using FTP.

Although it may seem like encoding is unnecessary for files that are
plain text, certain email gateway, trasport, and delivery agents pose
a threat to the integrity of even text files (much less binary files).
For example, long lines may be wrapped, trailing spaces deleted, tabs
turned into spaces, lines beginning with "From " modified, etc.

Pine uses the MIME Internet standard for attaching files to email messages.
Any MIME-capable mailer should be able to understand Pine's attachments.

If you use Pine's attachment feature, your recipient needs to have either
a MIME-capable mail reader or software that can decode MIME. Fortunately,
these are not hard to find. The major proprietary mail vendors have
committed to MIME support, but some of their upgraded products are some
months away.  One freely-available program which can decipher a MIME
attachment is munpack from Carnegie Mellon. It is available at:

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: How can I send a text file without it being encoded?


This is easily done by using Pine's "file inclusion" key (Control-R).
Instead of entering the file name on the Attchmnt header line, move
the cursor to the bottom of your messaage, and press Control-R, then
enter the name of the text file.  It will be included at the end of 
your message without any encoding (unless the file contains 8bit or
binary characters, in which case the entire message becomes subject
to MIME encoding rules.)

  [ Part 7.4: "Why does Pine use Base64 instead of UUENCODE?" ]

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Why does Pine use Base64 instead of UUENCODE?


Pine uses the Internet MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)
standard for all attachments.  MIME uses "Base64" encoding rather than
uuencode, because uuencode uses characters that are transformed by some
email gateways, and there are also several incompatible versions of
uuencode.  However, if needed, you can certainly uuencode a file outside
of Pine, then use the Composer's Ctrl-R (file inclusion) command to insert
the uuencoded file into the message.

A perl script (and conversion to C of same) that converts OpenWindows mail
to MIME. Body parts currently supported are: text, gif, Sun rasterfile
(converted to image/gif), postscript, and audio. Other types default to
application/octet-stream. It's easy to extend the set of types supported
and to add conversions, if necessary. 
   
The script requires uuencode, uudecode, zcat (aka uncompress), and the

  [ Part 8.2: ""Folder Format Invalidated (consult an expert), aborted" ]

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: "Folder Format Invalidated (consult an expert), aborted"

                                       

The message "Folder Format Invalidated (consult an expert), aborted" means
that Pine was reading your mail folder, and at the point in which it
expected a start-of-message header line, it found something else. 
   
The ``format invalidated'' condition can happen in one of three ways: 
    1. bad data exists at the beginning of the folder. 
    2. data was appended to the folder after Pine initially read it, and
       the new data did not begin with a start-of-message-header. 
    3. the folder was modified without Pine being aware of it. 
       
All three problems are generally caused by software external to Pine. 
   
Condition (1) can be determined by whether or not the problem repeats
itself after restarting Pine. If restarting Pine does not make the problem
go away, then you need to look at the actual file for the folder and see
what is wrong with the very first line. In particular, make sure that
there are no blank lines at the beginning of the file and that the first
character of the folder file is a capital ``F'' , the second an ``r'', the
third an ``o'', etc.  In the case of an INBOX, you may want to rename the
folder so that new mail can be delivered while repairs on the corrupt
folder are being done. 
   
Condition (2) may be caused by a mail delivery process (e.g. /bin/mail)
which writes some characters other than ``From '' at the beginning of the
new data. 
   
Condition (3) is caused by another program manipulating the mail folder
without following the normal folder locking protocols.  This is a general
problem on UNIX. 
   
Conditions (2) and (3) have also been known to occur when accessing
folders via NFS, if the information returned by the stat() and read()
system calls do not correspond with each other as a result of NFS
attribute caching. 
   
Restarting Pine on that folder always clears conditions (2) and (3). If
the problem is chronic, it may be worth an investigation to determine its
cause. Usually, it is due to the misbehavior of some external software.
The reason why Pine gives up with conditions (2) and (3) is that it does
not want to risk damaging user data by guessing what is right. Pine never
writes to the folder unless it is absolutely sure it knows what it is
doing. 
   
There are some steps which can be taken to reduce the risk of these
conditions coming up. Some of these steps may require the assistance of
your system adminstrator (or whomever it was that built and installed Pine
on your system): 
    1. Use IMAP instead of NFS to access remote folders. Problems with
       locking over NFS are perhaps the single most important cause of
       user difficulties.  Using IMAP eliminates this class of problem.
    2. Consider enabling the mbox driver in Pine. If the mbox driver is
       enabled, mail is transferred from the /usr/spool/mail mail into a
       file called mbox in your home directory, if mbox exists. The home
       directory mbox file is then your INBOX. This has the advantage
       that Pine and the mail delivery system are less often in
       contention for the INBOX, and never both trying to update it.
       Pine only empties the /usr/spool/mail file, it never tries
       updating it. 
    3. Be careful not to run other programs that modify your folders
       while you are running Pine. Such programs may change the folder
       out from under Pine, and lead Pine to conclude that there is a
       problem with its view of the file. 
       
  [ Part 8.3: "What is folder locking and how does it work?" ]

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is folder locking and how does it work?

                                       

Locks are used by Pine and other mail programs to prevent damage from
occurring to the mail file when multiple programs try to write to the file
at the same time. 
   
Because there are many different schemes of mail file locking used on
UNIX, Pine implements all of them. The result is a lot of complexity. 
   
There are several reasons why locking needs to be done:
   
    1. If you want to read the mail file, you want to make sure that no
       other process will modify the mail file while you are reading it.
       
    2. If you want to write to the mail file, you want to make sure that
       no other process is accessing the mail file while you are writing
       it.
       
    3. If you have the mail file open, you want to make sure that no
       other process can alter any of the internal contents of the mail
       file that you have read, but it is OK if another process appends
       new data to the mail file.
       
    4. If you want to alter any of the internal contents of the mail
       file, you want to make sure that no other process has the mail
       file open.
       
There are several mechanisms of locking:
   
     * The creation of a file which has the same name as the mail file,
       but with a suffix of ".lock" (for example, this lock for
       /usr/spool/mail/isma is named /usr/spool/mail/isma.lock). This
       file accomplishes locks (1) and (2) above. This is an exclusive
       lock. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_SH on the mail file. This
       accomplishes lock (1), and prevents lock (2). Multiple processes
       can do this. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_EX on the mail file. This
       accomplishes lock (2), and prevents lock (1). This is an exclusive
       lock. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_EX on a file on /tmp. The file
       name used depends upon the version of Pine. This accomplishes
       locks (3) and (4). This is an exclusive lock. 
       
On SVR4-based systems, the lockf() subroutine or fcntl() system call it
used instead of flock(). It is rumored that this creates a kind of lock
file as well, but this has not been directly verified. 
   
_NOTE: flock() on BSD systems does not work over NFS, so only the most
basic .lock file locking -- locks (1) and (2) happen over NFS. On SVR4
systems, fcntl() locking attempts to work over NFS, but there are known
problems in the rpc.lockd daemon which have caused hangs if an application
beats on the mechanism too much (and Pine beats on it). All of the above
mechanisms work reliably over IMAP connections._
   
   
  [ Part 8.4: "What happens when two Pine sessions access the same mai" ]

Subject: What happens when two Pine sessions access the same mailbox at the same time?

                                       

This varies depending on what format your folders are stored in. With the
default Berkeley format, the last session to open a folder will get full
access to the folder and the previous session(s) will be changed to
read-only access. When a folder is read-only, you will not see any further
updates to that folder until it is reopened with full access. Currently
the INBOX cannot be reopened without exiting and restarting Pine. With the
Tenex format, any number of sessions can simultaneously have full access
to a folder, with the exception that expunging is disabled. See "What is a
Tenex mailbox and why should I use it?" for more information. 
   
  [ Part 8.5: "Why did I get the message "locked, override in _XXX_ se" ]

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Why did I get the message "locked, override in _XXX_ sec"?

                                       

The message "locked, will override in _xxx_ seconds" occurs when Pine has
discovered that some other mail program claims to be accessing your mail
folder (i.e. _folder_.lock exists). This is a very low-level lock used by
programs such as the system mailer in delivering mail, and by certain
programs such as mail, elm, babyl, mm, etc. Supposedly, this lock is only
to be acquired and held for a very short period of time (less than a
second). 
   
It starts with 285 seconds, retries every second, and issues that message
every 15 seconds. The total period of time, 5 minutes, is the time that it
will keep on trying before it concludes that the lock is false -- that is,
that whatever program locked the folder forgot to unlock it (perhaps it
crashed) -- and Pine will go ahead and claim the lock for itself. 
   
This is not due to a conflict between two copies of Pine, since Pine
interlocks against itself in a higher-level fashion. 
   
_NOTE: On some systems with 14 character filename limits, attempting to
open a folder with a 14 character name (e.g. saved-messages) will trigger
this sequence. Folder names should be limited to 9 characters or less on
those systems._
   
  [ Part 8.6: "Why doesn't Pine recognize Content-Length header field?" ]

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Why doesn't Pine recognize Content-Length header field?


It would be a significant detriment to the performance of the Berkeley
format mailbox parsing code, as well as to Pine's behavior on normal
systems which do not use the Content-Length: header, if any attempt were
made to implement Content-Length:. 

There are many serious technical problems with the Content-Length: 
header, and we do not recommend its use.  Furthermore, we recommend that a
mail delivery agent such as our sendit or tmail tool be used that applies
smart quoting, as opposed to the ordinary BSD /bin/mail quoting of all
lines that begin with "From ".  We have installed such tools on all of our
systems. 

For example, one problem is that a system whose mailer does not implement
Content-Length: will also not enforce its validity should that header
appear. This offers significant potential for mischief.  Another problem
is that Berkeley format mailbox files which use the Content-Length: header
can not be edited with an editor such as emacs or vi without invalidating
the Content-Length: field.  If this problem is not a consideration at your
site, we recommend the use of the tenex format (mail.txt), which is also
length tagged but in a much more efficient fashion. 

>From our perspective, these problems outweigh any possible benefit of
supporting Content-Length: in Berkeley format mailbox files.  At the
present time there are no plans to do so.

Not yet, but Kerberos support is planned for a future release of Pine. If
you have access to Kerberos or AFS compatible IMAP clients already, the
following information may be useful. 
  
The current version of imapd does not support AFS or Kerberos
authentication.  However, the routine which validates authentication is
designed as a drop-in module, to allow you to replace with alternative
authentication schemes such as AFS, Kerberos, S/Key, etc. 
   
This routine is server_login(). Depending upon which version of c-client
you have, it is either in the os__xxx_.c (where _xxx_ is the name of your
port) or it is in a file named log__yyy_.c which is included by the
os_xxx.c file. 
   
The log__yyy_.c is usually log_std.c (std for "standard UNIX"), but it may
be log_sv4.c (SVR4) or a couple of other variants. This file only contains
that one routine, so it should be a simple matter to modify that file and
rebuild imapd.

No.  Neither Pine nor PC-Pine currently support POP's offline mail model
(wherein pending mail is pulled from the mail server to the local machine
and deleted from the server).  However, it is likely that this model will
be supported, with a choice of either IMAP or POP as the access protocol,
in a future release. 
    
  [ Part 10.3: "What is a Tenex mailbox and why should I use it?" ]

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is a Tenex mailbox and why should I use it?



Using the Tenex format for INBOXes allows multiple sessions (or mulitple
users, subject to the usual access controls) to have *almost* full
Read-Write access to the INBOX. The only limitation on full RW access is
that if there are multiple sessions at a given moment, no one can do an
Expunge. However, message state changes (e.g. marking a msg as deleted)
*can* be done, and this state is preserved across sessions. 
   
If an explicit Expunge command fails, it will say so and tell you that the
mailbox is in use by another process. When there is only one session left
using that mailbox, expunge will resume working again. 
   
In contrast: the normal Berkeley style folders can have only one RW client
at a time, so _given the current software_ the latest session steals the
RW lock away from any previous session, with the earlier session becoming
RO. 

NOTE:  Mailbox format for INBOX is a function of the mail transfer agent
(sendmail, tmail), not the mail user agent (Pine), so this is a decision
for sys/mail admins, not for regular Pine users.

Subject: Where does Pine look for configuration information?

                                     
In Unix and PC Pine 3.90 and higher, the Release Notes (Press "R" on the 
Main Menu) contain a section on Configuration, including default file names 
and environment variables.  Almost all personal configuration can be
accomplished through the Setup (S) command on the main menu. 

Unix Pine uses three configuration files:  a system-wide defaults file, 
a system-wide non-overridable settings file and a personal coniguration file.
If you need to generate a "blank" copy of the system wide configuration
files, run "pine -conf > /usr/local/lib".  If, for some reason, you need to 
generate a blank personal configuration file, run "pine -P pinerc.blank".

You have several options:
   
    1. Leave inbox in /usr/spool/mail, but turn on the Pine option to
       prompt users to move read messages to a folder in their home
       directory upon exiting Pine. 
    2. Modify your mail delivery program to deliver mail directly into
       the user's home directory, and specify that inbox-path in your
       global pine.conf (See the "tmail" program on
       ftp.cac.washington.edu for an example.) 
    3. "touch mail.txt" in each home directory, which will cause Pine
       (upon startup) to pull mail from /usr/spool/mail into ~/mail.txt
       -- however, mail.txt will be a Tenex-format, rather than Berkeley
       mail format folder (faster, but non-standard). 
    4. Link in the "mbox" driver when you build Pine. This driver will
       (upon Pine startup) pull mail from /usr/spool/mail into ~/mbox,
       which will be a Bky-format folder.

From: Gunther Anderson <gunther@ssi.edc.org>
Subject: I cannot compile under SCO unix, why not?


Pine has been tested and compiles just fine on a suitably equipped SCO
Unix 3.2.4, and probably works on the whole 3.2 series (testing has not
been as extensive).  It handles both MMDF and sendmail mailboxes without
needing recompilation.  It should be sufficient just to unpack the source
tree and run "sh build sco" at the top level.  You need to own the
complete Development System, and the Developer's Versions of the other
packages.  Pine will not compile without TCP/IP support. 

The most common problem is when people own the Development System, but
keep getting missing header files (netbd.h is one) in their builds.  This
is a common problem on SCO systems because of the great fragmentation SCO
enjoys in the marketing of system components.  It is easy to get confused
about just what you've bought.  And in this case, haven't bought. What you
need is the "Developer's Version" of the TCP/IP product.  The normal
version just supports the TCP/IP protocol, but doesn't include tools
(including header files) to compile TCP/IP-specific programs.  Alas, the
only remedies available to you are to pick up a pre-compiled version (mine
is on odi.cwc.whecn.edu, ftp.celestial.com has their own, which prefers
Bezerk mailboxes, though it supports MMDF too), or to buy the Developer's
Version of TCP/IP.  If you intend to do any serious compiling of Internet-
available programs, I'd recommend the latter, though many of the most
useful ones are available precompiled on other FTP sites.

Subject: What new features will future releases of Pine include?

The list for 3.92 is not frozen yet.  This release will have a number of
bug fixes, but it will also introduce several new features.  Some of
the things we know will be there include:

 o Fix for some pine.conf variables not working (e.g. local bug address).
 o Delete flag will no longer be preserved on Save.
 o Bky mbox format performance bug fixed.
 o Reply prompt will change if there is a Newsgroups header present.
 o Improvements in software flow-control handling.
 o Improvements in bug report command.
 o Ability to specify an alternative to the sendmail MTA.
 o Support for negotiating 8BITMIME with an ESMTP server.
 o Mouse support for use with X terminals.
 o Pull-down command menus in the Windows version.
 o Feature to disable capture of pipe command output.
 o Ability to use mailcap viewer for attachments of type TEXT.
 o Support for .mime.types file to specify attachment types.

After 3.92 is released, here are a few of the things that we plan to 
work on:

     * Additional MIME support, esp. controlling file TYPING 
     * PEM and/or PGP support 
     * External directory services access 
     * Kerberos support 
     * RFC1522 header encoding for 8bit character sets 
     * Location independence of support files 
     * Offline support 
     * Hierarchy support (awaits IMAP4) 
     * Answered flag not set if reply is postponed (awaits IMAP4) 
     * Faster detection of folders with Recent messages (awaits IMAP4) 
     * Faster fetching of headers (awaits IMAP4) 
     * Determination of which flags are permanent (awaits IMAP4)

 I cannot believe this.  I was trying to change my setup in pine according

 I have saved sooooo much good information in there and now it all gone.

It's more likely that you've changed the
"folder-collections" line than actually
deleting all of your folders.

Choose [Config] from the Setup menu and
delete any value from the "folder-collections"
line.  If, after restarting Pine, you still
can't access your folders check what someone
else has their "folder-collections" line set
to and try that.

I hope that works!

Assume the file is called "picture.gif" and it is in your home 
directory.  Do the following:

  1. UUEncode the file via the command

	uuencode picture.gif picture.gif > picture.uue

  2. Start up Pine.

  3. Compose your message.

  4. Move to the end of the message (include the signature if any -
     go all the way to the end.)

  5. Press the CONTROL-R key sequence.

  6. Supply the name "picture.uue" to the prompt asking for the file
     name to include.

  7. Press CONTROL-X to send the message.

  8. Exit Pine.

  9. Delete the uuencoded file via the command

	rm picture.uue

The command in Step 1 encodes the file so that it may later be re-incarnated
under the same name.  The first parameter is the name of the input file.  The
second parameter is the name that uudecode will use when the file is
re-created (generally they are the same).  The "> picture.uue"  re-directs
the output of the uuencode command to the file "picture.uue"  (you can use
any name that makes you happy - it's just a temporary file anyway.) As with
most Unix things there are alternate ways of doing the same thing, but I find
this is the simplest. 

You don't even need to invoke Pine to send it - if all you want to do is 
send the file without including a message, try the command

  uuencode picture.gif picture.gif | mail -s "Subject text" user@host

This will encode the file and mail it in one step to the target user 
("user@host") with the subject "Subject text" and the body containing 
only the encoded file.

To extract and decode the file, do

  1. Launch Pine.

  2. Highlight the message at the index or read it.

  3. Enter the CONTROL-E combination to extract the message to a file.

  4. Supply any file name at the prompt; generally I use "mcn" because
     they are my initials and easy to type... :{)

  5. Exit Pine.

  6. Enter the command

	uudecode your-file-name

     where "your-file-name" is the name of the file you supplied in
     Step 4.

UUDECODE will create a file with the same name as the second argument 
supplied on the uuencode command line.  This can be annoying at times, 
because sometimes you don't know what the encoded file name was.  The 
easiest way to find that out is to do the command

	grep begin your-file-name

where again "your-file-name" is the name you saved the file as.  You'll 
see a line something like

	begin 666 new-file-name

where "new-file-name" is the name uudecode will use when it rebuilds the 
file.  In some Unix systems (Sunos for example) if there are spaces in 
the file name only the first part is used; for example if you see

	begin 666 My file

the new file will be called "My".  The number is the protection mode the file
will be created with; generally it's 666 [anyone can read and write the
file], 755 [the owner can read write and execute the file, others can read
and execute it], or some other combination.

You need to be a bit careful using uudecode on files sent by other 
people; for example, if the begin line looks like

	begin 755 .login

the decoded file will replace your .login file (with possibly un-amusing 
results the next time you log in...)  Remember - on the Net, ALWAYS look 
a gift file in the mouth! :{)  [Note my forebearance in working ".gif" 
into this...]

Hope this helps,

Mike

I think it is a reason to get a new feature to the next version????

As far as I interpret it, pine compares the address of the account you
are reading mail from with the address in the To: field.  Identical means
it gets the +.  The problem in my case is (and I think that this becomes
relevant to more and more people) that we use here generic mail addresses,
i.e., my address is thomas.ulich@oulu.fi, but that's not at all an account,
its only an alias on our main server. If now somebody sends mail to that
address, I don't get the +, because pine thinks, that it is some mailing
list or whatever.

I actually would in my case prefer that pine completely forgets about the
machine I am writing from (NIS, always a different one), and uses ONLY
the generic address (defined to it by me) for sending mails.  Now it
is defined only in the reply-to, so the other address still appears some-
where.

Does the MS product allow you to set the IP address to 0.0.0.0 (or some other
mangy value) and get it's information via BOOTP?  We do that with Chameleon,
SuperTCP (SuperTCP has to be upgraded to at least V3.5 for this to work),
InterSLIP, MacPPP, and VersaTerm SLIP (the latter 3 for Mac systems) dialing
up through Annex systems and it works great.  I believe Trumpet also supports
this... 

Of course, that assumes the Shiva responds properly to BOOTP requests...

Thanks,

Mike

Assuming your folder-collections is "mail/[]" (that is, all your pine 
Email is stored in the directory tree "mail" in your main directory, you 
cold do:

  1. Rename the mail collection (I find it easier to do at the source
     than the destination):

	mv mail oldmail

  2. Create a container file so that you can transfer the entire tree
     easily between providers:

	tar cf oldmail.tar oldmail

     Note that on some systems you can do

	tar czf oldmail.tgz oldmail

     to create a gnu-zipped tar file, or

	tar cZf oldmail.tar.Z oldmail

     to create a compressed tar file (note that the gzip utility
     compresses better than the stock compress utility, but these may
     not be available at your particular site.)

  3. ftp "oldmail.tar" to your new machine:

	ftp  new.machine
	username: ...put in your new username...
	password: ...put in your new password...
	ftp> binary
	ftp> put oldmail.tar   (or oldmail.tgz or oldmail.tar.Z)
	ftp> exit

  4. remove the container file:

	rm oldmail.tar         (or oldmail.tgz or oldmail.tar.Z)

  5. Log into your new machine.

  6. Unbundle your old mail:

	tar xf oldmail.tar
		-or-
	tar xzf oldmail.tgz
		-or-
	tar xZf oldmail.tar.Z

  7. Remove the container file:

	rm oldmail.tar         (or oldmail.tgz or oldmail.tar.Z)

  8. Add "oldmail/[]" to your folder-collections.

You should have your old mail available.  When you are satisfied with 
this,

  9. Log into your old account and delete your old mail:

	rm -R oldmail

Hope this helps,

Mike

Hi all,

is there a way to take addresses and add them to an existing addressbook 
without having to mark them, apply the take, and save it to an 
addressbook list?  I'd like to just take an address for an individual 
message but currently they must be marked with the ";" before I can do 
this?  is this something for the wish list?

TIA,

-Mike-

What's causing the readonly flag? How do I turn it off?

	I'm not an authority on the matter, but I had the same problem
I think it was because PC-Pine saves things in a slightly different (i.e.
nonstandard) format.  Every folder that I had downloaded from my Unix
account to my PC was readonly when I opened it with PC-Pine.  I went
through the folders, saved them to new folders, and ditched the old ones.
(In retrospect, I probably should have saved the old ones...just in case...)

When I go into setup for pine the only choice is attached to ansi which

Does Pine 3.91 support this stuff? Should I move to elm+metamail ?

I was wondering if pine could receive/send messages from/to a ccmail gateway on a novell network.   If this is possible could 
someone please give me a clue as to what direction I should be going in.

re: Help Pt 2: Keying newsgroup indices

Right at the outset you'll realize that I know next to nothing about all 
this stuff. But if you'll just bear with me, I'd appreciate it.

Is there any way to key the newsgroup indices so that when I reopen a 
particular newsgroup my highlighter will pickup where I left off?

If it makes any difference I'm running a Mac. I have absolutely no 
technical expertise (this translates into, "Any explanation may need to 
be in one syllable words").

I would appreciate any help I can get.

Thanks

Ed

re: Help Pt 1: Getting around the newsgroups


Picture this scenario.

I am in a newsgroup, scanning the index. I find a posting that I want to 
look at. I move the highlighter to that posting then command "V" to see it.

Now comes the rub. I want to go from that open posting directly back to 
the index. Is there anyway to do this?

Right now, I get back to the index in a relatively round about way.

When I have finished with the open posting I make the following commands:
"M" to the main menu
"L" to list the folder
"V" to select from the expanded list
"V" to view the folder which gets me back to the particular newsgroup index.

Is there a way to go directly from the open posting to the newsgroup index?

Thanking you ahead of time.

Ed

I use procmail 3.10... it filters my incoming mail and i have it set to 
autorespond as indicated in my signature... it's really great at what it 
does.

There will be a config variable in the next version called something like 
"alt-addresses" which lists alternate addresses that should be considered 
to be you.  This also slightly changes how a couple other things (like 
reply) work.  Right now it's an additive variable, which gets added to 
the current name you are going by (as opposed to replacing the current name).

I'm having a hard time remembering whether or not this was broken in 3.90 
or not and it probably isn't worth figuring it out.  With 3.91 this 
should work fine as long as you have a properly configured mailcap (which 
I think you must or metamail wouldn't work).  I just tried it on one of 
the Internet-draft messages.  I viewed the message, then pressed View 
again to go into the attachment viewer, then moved down to 2.2 and 
pressed View again.  This spawned the showexternal program which is what 
is configured in our mailcap file for message/external-body.

Pine3.91 bypasses the Single vs. List mode screen if there is only one 
address, on the assumption that you would want to create a single 
addressbook entry for that one address.  That was an incorrect 
assumption.  Pine3.92 will not do that, so should act the same way it 
acts when the person mails to list-request.  There is a work-around that 
*may* be less painful than using cut and paste.  If you Select the 
message (;<CR>) then Apply Take (AT) you will go into List mode in the 
TakeAddress screen instead of bypassing it.

I've had some success with mkpgp, but the'res an annoying problem I've
found with it.  Anytime I want to sign my message with my PGP key, I get
an error of 'invalid if format' and it ends the program without doing
anything.  :(  I'm no csh script editor, so I really can't figure out
what's going on.  If anyone has had this problem and knows how to fix it,
it'd be much appreciated.  =)

Lately, I've been checking signed clear text by piping the message to
"pgp -f" and adding keys by piping to "pgp -fka".  When an encrypted 
message is piped to "pgp -f", Pine appears to hang.  I just discovered 
that it's really waiting for the passphrase.  Type it in and presto, a 
decrypted message in the viewer.

Hi,

I am using sendmail 8.6.9 on IRIX 5.3.

I would like to make our email addresses (both *username* and
*domainname*) insensitive to uppercase characters. I mean that I want
to make possible that people use the address Perrot@GRBB.PolyMtl.ca
(for example) instead of perrot@grbb.polymtl.ca.

I make this possible for local adresses (ex : Perrot instead of
perrot) by removing the 'u' F flag in the line below :

#Mlocal, P=/bin/mail, F=EDFMlsmu, S=10, R=20, A=mail -s -d $u
Mlocal, P=/bin/mail, F=EDFMlsm, S=10, R=20, A=mail -s -d $u

1) I tried to modify the Mether line without success for complete address
(used by people from outside our domain).

#Mether, P=[IPC], F=mDFMXCu, S=11, R=21, E=\r\n, A=IPC $h
Mether, P=[IPC], F=mDFMXC, S=11, R=21, E=\r\n, A=IPC $h

2) Furthermore, by doing the modification for local user, I am not able
to send e-mail to people who have uppercase characters in their login
name (error message : user unknown). 

Any idea about those 2 problems ?

Thanks in advance.		Gildas.

I have a dial up account. I received the same tip about stty. However,
everytime I dialed up to connect with the internet host, I had to 
re-enter this command. I received another tip saying to edit my .login 
file and add this stty business there. It worked.

I notice that WP5.2 tells me the same thing. However, I think this 
conversion is actually converting a Unix ASCII file to a DOS ASCII file.
I have a dial up account and I've noticed that all text files I download 
from the Internet host have to be converted in this way.

Another way to do the conversion (at least it works for me) is to first 
open the text file using the  MS-DOS EDIT and then save it in the regular 
way. You can then open it using any other editor as plain DOS ASCII.

My dos communications program, Ripterm, does not have vt100 terminal

likely to cause any problems wwith a dial up account using pine on the

vt102 is a superset of vt100, with additional character insertion codes,
maybe a couple of other enhancements.  Selecting vt100 should always work
with a vt102 emulator, though not vice-versa.

That happens frequently on our system (Pine 3.91, Solaris 2.3).  I asked 
about it here several weeks ago, and the best guess anyone offered was 
that I was getting mail addressed to me at several alternate addresses.  
Not so.  Mail comes to me at fold@mail.bcpl.lib.md.us, no other address, 
but Pine doesn't always mark my personal mail with a "+".

That't good news.  While you're at it, how about having Pine flag mail 
cc'd to the user?  cc'd mail can be just as important at mail addressed 
directly to the user, but without a flag it gets lost among all the 
mauling list stuff.

This should work with the default sendmail.cf.  The hostname part
will *definitely* work, and that's completely independent of
sendmail.

I think there was a bug in 5.2 sendmail where in aliases, case wasn't
ingnored, and in 5.3, there was a bug where even program names in .forward
files got forced to lower case.  I think the current sendmail on ftp.sgi.com
has both of these fixed.

Greetings: I have a couple of e-mail addresses that appear to be in teh 
x.400 style. Can someone suggest what syntax I must use to reply to 
either of these or compose a new message to?

Thanks

Thanks to Curt Lanza who responded to my question regarding the 
system-wide specification of lpr as a printer.

I've managed to locate the pine.conf file (global pine settings.)
What I'm NOT sure of is the syntax for the command to specify the printer.
Info in the pine.conf file states that the parameters used in that file 
should be the same as the ones in the Setup Config menu (from the main menu.)
The Setup Config menu, however, does not have a parameter for changing 
the printer; it's located in the Setup Printer menu.

Does anyone know what parameter I need in the pine.conf file to specify 
lpr as the printer?

Thanks,

Does anybody know if PINE 3.91 accessed by a telnet session to an e-mail 
provider can print locally to a laserjet printer.  I can't seem to make 
it work unless I create a log file that traps the screen dump, save the 
file, import it into a text editor and print it out that way.  It works 
but its not the most elegant way of doing this I'm sure.

MORE SECURITY PROBLEMS ON THE INTERNET
The Computer Emergency Response Team has issued a public warning on a
vulnerability in some 20 commonly used e-mail programs that run on Unix
operating systems.  The advisory said the latest discovery could allow a
hacker to "read any file on the system, overwrite or destroy files."  The
ultimate solution to these recurrent security problems, says Purdue
University professor Eugene Spafford, is for consumers to demand better
security features from software manufacturers.  In the absence of improved
software, "are we going to continue seeing problems? You bet."  (Wall
Street Journal 2/23/95 B8)

Hwi... I (and many people I know) use Pico in conjunction with Tin to 
post news. While this is cunning for most of the (providing a Pine like 
environment for editing, with all of Tin's flexibilities), there is a 
problem when it comes to following up to articles at the end of long threads.

The problem comes from the length of the References: header, which can 
contain many message IDs. When it gets loaded into Pico, it is longer 
than 256 characters, and so it gets split up and has to be edited 
manually.

Any work rounds? I still want word-wrap turned on, because it's so useful 
for writing the article body. Why is tehert this 256 character limit on 
loading lines, but not on editing them?

ftp is used for transferring files from one machine to another.

Mosaic produce software, Netscape for example (Or is it the other

Hello, I would like to ask if anyone knows how to configure pine to use with xv to view jpg/gif?  I've added the "image-viewer=xv" in .pinerc but still would work.  Also, is it possible to use ghostview with pine?
Thanx,

I'm fortunate in that my employer supplied me with VersaTerm Pro for my 
MAC.  I use this to call up either the VAX or UNIX systems on campus and  
have not had a problem running Pine on either system.  The y print 
command has also worked just fine.  I'm sorry I couldn't help with the 
problem, just wanted to let you know that something works in the real world.

This is a shot in the dark but make sure that the binary 'xv' is in your
path or that you code the path into the call.
Example :
veiwer=/usr/local/bin/xv
Good luck

If you have X access to a SGI try MediaMail.  Enter
the command:

zmail -gui

If you don't have X try 'zmail' by itself.  I prefer it to
pine.

	Assuming that the PC version runs the same as the Unix version, 
which I imagine it does, there is an option on about the third page of 
the Setup Config screen that is a flag called signature-at-bottom.  Set 
that on, then it will put your signature at the bottom, except for 
forwarded messages.

I wrote a few days ago and still seem to be having a problem 
decoding pine when I pull messages into Word Perfect, either 
through capture (crosstalk) or copy.  Word Perfect tries to convert
from IA5 (whatever that is) and it still ends up being gibberish.  Am
I missing something obvious?  This didn't happen when I had the old Pine.
Anybody have any ideas on how to resolve this or even what it is?

After installing sendmail 8.6.10 I'm getting spurious "POSSIBLE ATTACK"
messages in syslog.  Apparently pine is sending some lists of mail
recipients with newlines in the list.  You see something like this in the
syslog (names have been changed to protect the guilty):

Feb 23 09:47:07 testsys sendmail[892]: POSSIBLE ATTACK from
jsmith@localhost: newline in string "Mike Smith <msmith@some.host>,
    Teresa Jones <tjones@another.host>,      Jeff Green
<jgreen@this.host>"

This is pine 3.91 on a SunOS 4.1.3 machine.

Anybody have a way around this (other than not using pine or completely
disabling the check in sendmail 8.6.10)?  It's adding a lot of junk to our
log files.

Thanks,

Jim

If you can download other files from your own directory, you should be 
able to download your inbox. To download using xmodem you would type:
   "sz -y /usr/spool/mail/<logon-id>"
ignoring the quotes and substituting your own logon.

When you're in a posting, just type "I" to return to the index. Cheers.

Subject: pine 3.91 will not post to usenet

Message-Id: <D4GGCM.Bro@news2.new-york.net>

our users experience a hang, (thats both at the console, and telneted-in),
trying to post to usenet. we know that the connection to the nntp server
is ok, because these same users are able to read usenet from the same server
acceptably. and can use the rtin nntp newsreader to post successfully. 

are we missing something? just about the only thing that seems to make 
sense is a problem with the inews standalone program, as trn is also
unable to post to usenet, and it, (trn), also doesn't have a builtin
inews functionality like rtin does. 

if this is a needed function, where can we get a linux binary for inews
that will run with 0.99.pl15g/net-2e kernel? or a source tree to compile
for ourselves? 

thanks in advance.....

Greetings!

Just pulled Pine 3.91 (from ftp.celestial.com compiled for SCO Unix 
3.2.4.x) and would like to use it on a stand alone system running mmdf.  
When I send mail from Pine, it doesn't seem to make it into the mail 
system for distribution.  I presume this is a function of Pine.

Elm works fine here.  Standard mail works, too.  I understand that Pine 
was written for use on networked systems (the 'i' in pine).  The most 
network these systems will see for some time is uucp (dialup).

Ideas?

Scot

This is more a factor of your communications software than your printer. 
I print to a laserjet using telix on my pc and microphone on mac. Once 
you have the right software it is just a matter of pressing 'y' to print 
to your local printer.

There are two versions of pine-3.91 on my system.  We use the
pine-3.91.tar.gz file which is compiled for use with smail-3.1.29 (a
real sendmail replacement -- no MMDF mailboxes), and the other is compiled
for use with stock SCO MMDF and was contributed by Gunter Anderson.

The non-mmdf system works fine reading either mmdf or bsd style
mailboxes, and by default sends mail via the sendmail interface
on the local system.  If you set smtp-server=hostname in your .pinerc
file it will use SMTP instead of sendmail (smail-3.1).  Of course this
won't work if you don't have TCP/IP on your system.

The I in pine doesn't have anything to do with networking (Pine is not
Elm :-).

is there any way to send mail to a distribution list without having the

is a common question or not, but i did not see any reference to it in the

if you have any input, please contact me here, or via e-mail.

Two ways:
1) Transfer your file to your server using your favorite protocol, 
Kermit, Zmodem, etc.  Then read it into your message ctrl-R.
2) Initiate a message and move to the body of the message, then initiate 
an ASCII transfer of the file directly from your floppy to the message.  
To do this, you will have to increase your intercharacter and interline 
delays.  I played with this at 10 ms between characters and 500ms between 
lines.  (I use Pibterm.  Alt-p, F, J gets you to the ASCII transfer

If you have the "pipe" command enabled in Pine, you can type

	|tr '[a-m][n-z][A-M][N-Z]' '[n-z][a-m][N-Z][A-M]'

f you're planning to do this more than once, you should put this 'tr'
command into a shell script, calling it 'rot13'.  You could then type

	|rot13

We have incurred a problem in sending a mail message to a large 
distribution list (here at U of Arkansas).  The initial report came from 
one of our end-users attempting to bcc a message to 60 students. I have 
recreated the problem on my personal account and tested approximately 
five times.  The problem was consistent and occurred each time. 

Pine will display one of two messages at the top left of the main menu 
immediately after attempting to send the message (CTRL-X).  It will 
display either "Segmentation Fault"  or "Buffer Error".  The message is 
NOT mailed to anyone and pine appears to continue operating as normal.

Upon looking at the .pine-crash file written by pine, I noticed a couple 
of IOCTL error messages and at the end of the file a "Pine Panic: Received 
Abort Signal" message.

I'm attaching the  contents of the .pine-crash file.

U of Arkansas is running Pine 3.91 on a Sun SparcCenter 2000 with the
Solaris/Unix system.  Please let me know if I can supply additional
information. 

Have you seen this problem before?  Is there something that we can do 
locally to "fix" the problem?  Thanks in advance for your help.

This is a feature, not a bug!  It's finding this stuff in your 
$HOME/.signature file.  If you want this to go at the bottom of your 
messages you can turn on the signature-at-bottom feature.  You can also 
change what file PINE looks for your signature in.

If you set pine's smtp-server to something this won't happen.  It's
happening when sendmail reads the header lines with the -t option. 
Alternatively, in comp.mail.sendmail, Eric Allman has suggested simply
commenting out the warning message in sendmail for now.

Mosaic and Netscape are two different World Wide Web browsers from two 
different sources.  Mosaic is from the NCSA.  I don't remember who 
produces Netscape.

I suggest you get a copy of the very good book, "INTERNENT YELLOW PAGES" 
from Osborne-McGraw/Hill publishers.. it lsits nearly 5000 of them PLUS a 
lot of other goodies.

I think the frame of reference is that those writers who produced MOSAIC 
for a government-sponsored project later resigned and went on to 
write NETSCAPE

James,
Could you tell us where you found "pretty good confirmation that Pine 
supports pop"?  We'd like to fix the docs if they imply that.  (Indeed, 
the docs *should* mention that Pine uses IMAP for remote folder access.)

POP normally implies "offline" operation wherein mail is downloaded from 
a mail drop/server to a local machine and deleted from the server.
Pine does not yet support "offline" operation, but it will in the future.
At that point, we expect that you will be able to use either POP or IMAP 
to download and delete messages from the server.

However, for now you can use a Unix POP client (e.g. one called
"popclient") and make it a "front-end" for Pine in a shell script.  This
should accomplish the same thing, though slightly less efficiently. 

Alternatively, you can ask the pic.net folks to run imapd alongside popd
and manually do an aggregate Save and Delete.

I want to set up a new ethernet/Internet connected system using IMAP and
PCPINE for mail distribution.  I have a Linux system I can use for the
central mail hub and IMAPd is running on it.  I am confused about what
needs to be done on the PC end and about accounts.  

We are using GVC NE2000 clones for NICs.  They seem to be functioning OK
(I have a system which is DOS/Linux -- the Linux side communicates with
the central mail machine as expected).  What software is needed on the PC
side so that PINE can communicate with the mail hub?  I expect a device
driver is needed -- what else?  Is there public domian software that will
do the job?  Where can it be obtained?  

Does using the IMAP-PINE connection imply that all mail recipients must
have regular user accounts on the central hub system, or are there special
mailbox only accounts which can be established? -- How?  Is there a
document that lays this all out?  I seem to need a road map if there is
one available.

Thanks for any help, suggestions or pointers.

Hi!

We are currently using Pine and imapd with the Berkeley mailbox driver on 
our Silicon Graphics platforms (specifically, we are currently using the 
mboxdriver version, which rips the mail out of the delivery file in 
/var/mail into the file $HOME/mbox).

I am wanting to start investigating using the Tenex format, with a 
possibly view to switching to its use generally on our systems.

Assuming that the Tenex driver is linked in to Pine and imapd is it 
simply a case of creating an empty "$HOME/mail.txt" file to start using 
Tenex format for my INBOX?  (I realise I'll have to do some fiddling to 
retain the messages currently in the "mbox" file -- don't worry!)

What about messages saved to other folders (in "$HOME/Mail/foldername").  
Do these always continue to be in Berkeley format, and only the INBOX 
goes Tenex?

Is it possible to force Tenex to be used for these other folders too, and
if so how?  (Some clever linking options?  File naming?  etc)

And finally can someone remind me of the script/program the Pine Team made 
available a while back to convert from Tenex back to Berkeley, and where it 
can be obtained from (in case I want to backtrack! :-)

With thanks,

Mike Brudenell                                               <pmb1@york.ac.uk>

Hello,

Can anyone point me to a possible solution. I call up a unix server from my 
PC, from that server I bring up pine and everytime I try to print a large 
document (20 pages) using the y command, I get abut 8 pages of material and 
then the system just hangs. I then have to control-c out of it and back to the 
system prompt.

I have tried a vaiety of pcs with the same result and I have even tried a 
different unix server that uses pine with the same result. Flow control is set 
to off on my terminal package. I have been using both telix and procomm.

So ... any ideas?

Scott

How does one mark all of the postings in a particular newsgroup as read 
in pine.  In rn, for instance, the keystroke is "c", to catch-up on all 
articles.  Any help will be appreciated.

I don't think there is anything available to give a
virtual packet driver in a VDM session. If you're
running WinOS2 and you're using Warp or 
IBM TCP/IP with the DOS access kit, then simply
use Pine for Windows.

I'm working on a port right now, but I'm also doing a lot
of other stuff, so it's going slowly.

	Hi,

	I'm a new pine user and I have  tried to send a message with a dvi file
	as an attachment but the MIME label generated has been
	"application/octet-stream".  Is it a way to specify manually the MIME
	label or to configure pine to be able to recognize the dvi file ?

I want to B)ounce a non-MIME message from an NSF mounted folder. The 
message is 1.6M and the folder itself is 2.1M

When I look at the message, it takes a few seconds for the 1.6M to arrive
over the network. When I press B)ounce, the machine starts to work for 
about 2 minutes. This is an 150MHz R4400 SGI Indy with 96M RAM (no 
swapping). At the and of the two minutes, ps says:

 F S   UID   PID  PPID  C PRI NI  P    SZ:RSS      WCHAN TTY      TIME COMD
30 S  5004  6711  6710  0  26 20  *  3607:3402  882de41c pts/3    3:06 pine

SZ:3607? That's 3607*4K=15M ??? 15 Megs to bounce a 1.6M message?

OK, let's do the controlled experiment.

F S   UID   PID  PPID  C PRI NI  P    SZ:RSS      WCHAN TTY      TIME COMD
No folder open:
30 S  5004  6805  6804  0  26 20  *   416:160   882de3f4 pts/3    0:00 pine
Only an open folder:
30 S  5004  6805  6804  5  26 20  *  1826:1195  882de3f4 pts/3    0:02 pine
View the file:
30 S  5004  6805  6804  1  26 20  *  2632:2411  882de3f4 pts/3    0:06 pine
Bounce (after asking for a destination, before I specify it):
30 S  5004  6711  6710  0  26 20  *  3607:3402  882de41c pts/3    3:06 pine

It appears pine
a) reads the whole folder in memory -- that's understandable, since it is 
   not with IMAP.
b) makes a fresh copy of the message bein viewed -- why that?
c) makes another copy of the message being bounced, this time doing 
   something with it for 3 minutes on an 150MHz R4000 96M machine.
   This is the craziest thing.

And on top of that, each time it makes a 4Meg copy of a 1.6Meg message.

And now who was telling, that this will work with IMAP over a 14.4 SLIP
connection to a 4M PeeCee :-(

Following is an updated post of a message I sent last week that did not
tell the whole story.  I got some useful feedback on Mac-related products. 

I'm hoping someone will have some PC-related information.

TIA,

I figure that there are so many folks out there using Pine with so many 
different configurations that one of you will be able to answer a 
question about PC IP products.

We are currenlty experimenting with a dial-up connection using a Shiva
Remote connecting to a Shiva LanRover.  When we log in, the Shiva box
assigns an IP address for that session. 

We are using an MS TCP/IP product that runs under Windows for WorkGroups,
which requires that the user update the IP address each time we log in to
match the IP address assigned by the Shiva box. 

Does anyone know of an IP product that will recognize and use the 
Shiva-assigned address automagically?  We are using a product with that 
capability on the Macs that are part of the test.

TIA,
Don Sugarman

Until a few days ago I confess that I was running PINE 3.05.  Now I am
running PINE 3.91.  The problem is that the new version doesn't see all of
my old mail folders.  That they are still there can be demonstrated by
running the old version.  How do I make the new PINE recognize the old
folders? 

Thanks in advance,

What mechanism does the Shiva box use to inform the host of the assigned IP
address?  Most boxes use RARP or BOOTP, some use DHCP, others don't do
anything more than send a text message.  If the box works OK on Macs running
Versaterm SLIP or MacPPP then my guess would be the Shiva will respond
properly to BOOTP (this is what Annex terminal servers do for example.) In
that case, we've tested: 

  Chameleon
  Trumpet Winsock
  SuperTCP

All of which work.  Note that for SuperTCP you MUST either use the V4.x 
software or upgrade the V3.0 to V3.5 via a ton o' patches on Frontier 
Tech's FTP site.  For Chameleon you need to configure the host address as 
"1.1.1.1", which is kind of weird but at least that's what the manuals 
say.

Trumpet Winsodk and Chameleon also have an adequate scripting language to 
get the IP address from a text response issued by the server if the 
server doesn't support RARP, BOOTP, etc.

Hope this helps,

Mike

  What version of pine are you using?
  with pine 3.91 you can use:
  ; [for select]
  A [for all]
  A [for action on selected, in this case all]
  S [save in folder]
  enter the name of the folder you want to create and press return
  If the folder you want does not exist, pine will ask you if you
  want to create it... answer with Y[es]

  Now, if you press X [expunge] and then Y[es], all those messages
  will "disappear" from the inbox... and will be in the new
  folder...
  
  good luck

  Pucho.

  btw if you use either S[ave] or D[elete] every time you read
  your mail... it would be much easier and organized... or at
  least answer Y[es] when you leave pine and are asked if you want
  to save the read messages and expunged the deleted messages

Hi!

Reading the man page of pine, I just found out that pine looks for new mail
every 2.5 min, or after a screen refresh (C-L), for example.  Is there a way
to change that 2.5 min interval?

Thanks & regards,

Hiya,

I have this problem which I find most annoying!
When I reply to a letter, I get the copied
text from previous letter AFTER my signature.

My QUESTION is:

How do I make pine include copied letter to which
Im about to reply to BEFORE my own signature?

PLEASE post or E-mail me at address below.

And Hey, Check out my homepage while you are at it!

What I learned from some of the good folks on here, is that it varies by
software.  In windows I must use the shift with Ctrl ^, but in telix
or procomm I do not.

Is there a way to export multiple messages into one file?  That is,
maybe select more than one mail message and typing "e", write them to

I'm using v 3.89, but I will also welcome an answer if using 4.91,

You can customize a lot of things in PINE, also this thing.  Have a look
at the main menu.  Choose S)etup.  Then C)onfig.  Then you get lots of
options.  If you do not know what they mean, just press the ? when you are
on it, and you'll get help.  Enable option: signature-at-bottom

Have fun,

Greetings follows Piners.

What is the best way to get brief headers in my exported files??  I notice 
when I forward I get only the 4 important lines.  But when I save I get more.

Do I use the ignore headername (to: from: type: date:) and if so where do 
I put this lovely command.  Also if anyone can tell the same thing for 
TIN I'd be eternally greatful.  I hate saving a four line posting with 68 
lines of paths ... {:-)

TIA, please e-mail answer also.  

And while I'm on it.  Is it a well-known bug that when you reply/answer a 
mesage, then postpone -- the messge is not properly flagged ??

Is there an easy way to write-out to a file while composing/replying ???  
That could give me multiple postpones .... right ????

FWIW.
