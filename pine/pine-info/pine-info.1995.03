Upgrade to Pine 3.91.

You then get a wonderful set of commands available called Select (;), 
Apply (A) and Zoom (Z).

Select lets you select messages using a variety of criteria (and also to 
broaden (OR) or narrow (AND) searches using different criteria).

Once you have selected some messages you can use the Apply command to 
apply another command to the entire selection (eg, A E will apply an 
export command to the selected messages).

Zoom limits the index list to just the selected messages (letting you 
concentrate on those without getting distracted by others).

Note that these commands are "power-user" commands: they are not 
available by default.  You must enable them in the Configuration screen 
(S then C from the Main Menu) by setting the 
"enable-aggregate-command-set" option.

Hi!

I would like to customize the addressbook table in pine which you get by
hitting A in the main menu.  After defining an alias I usually forget/do not
need to remember the e-mail address(es) behind it.  Instead of that I would
like to see the comments and maybe even the Fcc definition, in order to 
maintain the list more easily.

What about having a customizable addressbook-entry-table in pine?

...or do I miss some already existing feature?

Regards from one of those guys who left the path of wisdom (elm) to 
explore new mail dimensions never known before (/bin/mail, not really),

1.  Go to main Pine menu, choose Setup; select "configure":  In selection
menu, place "x" in "Enable aggregate command set".
 
2.  In any newsgroup, to catch up or to delete a range of articles,
various aggregate commands are available.  To delete all the articles,
type ;aad  which translates "select all, apply delete".
 
Thanks to Garland Boyd for this one...

use search (W in view mode, ^W in compose) and then ^Y for top ^V for bottom.

For world distribution, the Distribution: header should either be left 
blank, or left out completely.

You may want to build your pine with the MBOX driver:
   /usr/src/pine3.91>  ./build sgi EXTRADRIVERS=mbox

We have our mail spool NFS mounted.  By the way, MAIL_ATT doesn't work
with an NFS-mounted mail spool which is not exported with root permission.
MAIL_BSD does work fine, though.

Subject: How to convert Unix mail file to pine?
Date: 1 Mar 1995 16:16:34 GMT
Message-Id: <3j26l2$rse@narnia.ccs.neu.edu>

Having started out with SunOS' version of mail, I have a large file of
messages (mbox). I'd like to convert these to pine.  Pine seems to be able
to read them, but when I save and delete messages, they reappear in the
mail-created folder with dates "xxx"-ed.  Anyone know how to do the conversion?

As a related question, I'd like to have pine store my messages in order by
date of receipt, so when I open a folder, it's already in order.  I do not
want to have the folder sorted when it's opened, as this can take too long
(and is a waste of computer resources).  As far as I can tell, once a message
enters a folder, its physical position in the file is fixed.  Any ideas?

The easiest way is to uuencode them at the UNIX prompt level.  Then when you
in compose mode, include the file with the editor.  You may have to break
the uuencoded file into parts to fit into pico or to get through the mail.

Our Cisco terminal server has it's escape char set as Ctrl ^ x (Control 
caret, followed by the letter x).  As a result we have to hit Control 
caret twice in order for it to mark a block since the first one gets 
swallowed up by the terminal server.

Exactly what I want to do too. Have you made any progress? I am working 
along the following tracks:

1. PCPINE - As far as I can see, that won't even set up unless your PC has 
a domain name etc, ie won't work with a shell account. Correct me if wrong...

2. There are off-line readers available. YARN is widely used. Don't know 
if it works with Pine. Anyone know? I am about to download it and experiment.

3. The Pine folders have a specific structure, described in tech-notes. I 
have thought of feeding it through a text manipulation program and then 
into a database (fields would be From, To, Date, Subject, and a Memo 
field for the message). I can see broadly how to do this, but time, time ...

Cheers,

Subject: PCPINE hanging on opening INBOX -- help
Date: 1 Mar 1995 16:58:44 -0500
Message-Id: <3j2qmk$f1h@newsbf02.news.aol.com>

I'm using the ncsa packet driver for ne2000.  telnet works fine, so does
ftp, although it complains about an invalid packet driver vector.

So, config.tel seems to be ok, and configtel= is set properly.

But, when I put the {host.domain} in the pinerc path to INBOX, PCOINE_P
can't open the inbox.  If I then go into setup and configure and change
the path to {ip.address}, return and attempt to read the inbox, pine makes
the connection, and things seem to be fine.

If I then exit PINE, and try to run it again, with the path set to
{ip.address}, it hangs at opening INBOX -- requiring a reset.   If I
manually edit the pinerc file back to {host.domain}, it will at least come
up, although, again, it can't find the inbox until I go through setup,
etc., etc.

I'd appreciate any suggestions.

Thanks.

To whom it may concern,

My name is Al Khamis, I am the System Administrator at Galtronics LTD.
in Israel. 
I got throw uucp a tar file called: pine3.91_heb2.03.  At my
company we have Data General Unix System 5.4R2.10 that works in the 
Aviion 5500 server.  I tried compiling the source code for pine along 
with pico, mtest and imapd packages that came with the tar file.  Well as 
you see below only pico worked, but the rest did not, but I did not succeed.  
Pine is an excelant E-mail program, and we at Galtronics would love to 
use it, so if anybody can help us to figure out why is it not compiling, we 
will be very thankfull.  

here is the script I made while compiling:

That is what I do... use pico to edit a text file containing the following:

finger.sun keviny|grep "New mail"
finger.sun keviny|grep unread
finger.sun keviny|grep Unread
finger.sun keviny|grep "Mail last read"

Substitute finger.sun and keviny with your local finger command and your 
user-id respectively.  Then, type "chmod u+x <filename>" to make it 
executable.  I hope this helps.

Is it possible to insert a new line in the Pine header to include 
information that wouldn't normally appear in the header?  Your 
e-mail response is appreciated.  Thanks in advance.

Message-Id: <3j4jhp$htq@knot.queensu.ca>

I am having a problem printing email messages using the attached 
to ansi printer option in the setup menu.I am currently using 
windows and the trumpet winsock software to telnet to our unix 
server where pine 3.90 resides.
This print feature used to work using telnet in cutcp (Clarkson U.)
software in dos to connect so I know it isn't a printer prob.
Any help would be appreciated....

Forgive me if this is redundant; I rarely visit.

Pine apparently generates a ^J as part of a mail message. I don't know enough
about it to know why, but sendmail 8.6.10 "repairs" this and generates warnings
in my syslog.

(This is a result of the CERT advisory 95:05)

Is someone working on this, or, is there something I can suggest to our users
so this is no longer a problem?

Please tell me what's the latest version of Pine that I can use on a Mac. 
Also, how do I subscribe to pine news group?

I just finished compiling Pine 3.91 on our AV5225+ running DG/UX 5.4R3.00, 
and had the very same problem. I resolved it by adding two lines into the 
file pine3.91/imap/ANSI/c-client/os_d-g.h as follows:

#define MAILFILE "/var/mail/%s"
#define ACTIVEFILE "/var/news/active"
#define NEWSSPOOL "/var/spool/news"
#define NFSKLUDGE

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <dirent.h>
#include <sys/dir.h>
#include <time.h>		/* for struct tm */
#include <sys/uio.h>		/* needed for writev() prototypes */
#include <syslog.h>
#include <utime.h>        /* FIRST INSERTED LINE */

#define flock dg_flock

#undef utime              /* SECOND INSERTED LINE */
#define utime portable_utime
int portable_utime (char *file,time_t timep[2]);

#include "env_unix.h"
#include "fs.h"
#include "ftl.h"
#include "nl.h"
#include "tcp.h"

I then executed ./build clean followed by ./build d-g.  Please let me 
know if this does not fix the problem in 5.4R2.01.

Hello,

Yes, I know. What I'm after is, perhaps, some sort of option that might
go in pine.conf or .pinerc that suppresses the addition of the ^J until
things get straightened out.

Oh? Are you familiar with what 8.6.11 will do, i.e. does it have a fix
for this problem?

I'll have to tolerate it, thanks.

You can comment out the warning on lines 1540-1544 of util.c in the 8.6.10

Or you could use the Cyrus IMAP server, which uses an even more
efficient format for mail folders.

Yes, use the customized-hdrs entry in the Setup/Config screen (Pine 3.90

Also, if you are running Unix you can use the "from" command.
(from the man page)

   Name
     from - identifies sender of mail

   Syntax
     from [-f mailbox] [-s sender]

   Description
     The from command prints out the mail header lines in a mailbox file to
     show you who has sent mail to you.

I was just wondering if it is possible to set the
default saving folder to something like

mail/[$sender]

in order to give the default saving folder the
name of the sender. Example:

I get a mail from someone@nowhere.world, and
want to save it. Pine should then suggest the
saving folder 'someone'.

If this is possible I would be MOST grateful 
for e-mail reply or a posting in this group.

Thank you for your help!

Subject: IMAP Pine vs. Shell account
Date: Thu, 02 Mar 95 09:27:06 CST
Message-Id: <1735584EAS86.SYSPHURL@vm.uwp.edu>

 Recently Terry Gray described how email is handled at UW.
 I was especially interested in the description of the following:
 
 .....   The cluster includes 12 IMAP servers, although 4 were just added
 to accommodate expected growth.  We figure each of these IMAP servers can
 handle at least 200 concurrent sessions .........                , but
 users are not permitted to get a login shell on the IMAP servers.
 
 UW-Parkside is considering using PINE email and we are trying to size an
 appropriate RS/6000 (new server or upgrade a model 360).  I have a few
 questions:
 
 First, I see they do not allow shell accounts.  If shell and IMAP were
 both allowed, how do you think this would effect the max concurrent
 sessions (assuming half the users would use shell)?
 Second, are there other reasons for not allowing shell access?
 Third, would there been any negative implications to not allowing
 shell access?
 And Fourth, assuming students have non-shell access to usenet, how
 would they store their personal subscriptions
 (server, diskette, ... )?
 
 We are very interested in IMAP PINE.
 And thank you Terry for your original post.

Note that this method will only work if your sys admin has set tin
up to subscribe to all groups if there is no .newsrc.   Some sys
admins set things up so that the default is to subscribe you to
only local newsgroups and newuser newsgroups.  I think there is a
way to subscribe to everything from within tin - it involves using
y to yank in all newsgroups.  Maybe a tin user could post the 
instructions...

Hello,

I have this problem when trying to post to a news group.  When I want to
post, the terminal locks up when the posting screen is displayed.  Nothing
works, I can't ^C or ^Z.  When I kill the process it does not die gracefully
and leaves the terminal in a frozen state:-(

Everything else works great!  I have pine 3.91 and am running FreeBSD 2.0.

Any info or a * to info would be greatly appreciated.

Try to use procmail.  Perhaps you can ask you system admin to set it up 
for you.

look in .pinerc.... be sure to have the line:

that's what does it in my .pinerc file...

One thing that I find myself doing far too often is doing selections
on a very large volume of mail.

It'd be nice to be able to automate it with a macro facility of some
sort..   Even more of the "startup keystrokes" type of thing would be
useful.

Damn, it looks like I'm going to have to give up and learn procmail...

Hi,

I received what appeared at first to be a MIME compliant mail message,
except that the attachment used x-uuencode for the content transfer
encoding.  I know the MIME standard discourages the use of alternate
encodings (especially uuencode) to the default base64, but is there
a way configure pine to use uuencode instead?  Or perhaps something
can be put into the mailcap file?

Regards,
Makoto Ikeda

Subject: accessing mh and berkeley style folders under pine.
Date: 03 Mar 1995 15:06:44 GMT
Message-Id: <ROUILJ.95Mar3100644@xt.cs.umb.edu>


All of the comments below pertain to pine 3.91 on Solaris 2.3/2.4. PC
access will be with the appropriate version of pine for a pc running
dos/windows ....

My users who have X-terminals use exmh for mail reading, however I
need a solution for mail access when these users are not on the
X-terminal E.G. dialup and pc or tty access. Also I would like the
users to have access to regular "From " delimited berkeley mail format
mail boxes (these are used for archiving mailing lists).

So how do I configure pine to use the MH folder/subfolder arrangement,
while preserving the ability to read regular mboxes. Access to these
folders is over NFS. Do I have to use pine in IMAP client mode to
support MH folder access?  The way I have defined my folder collections
are:

folder-collections=Mail/[],
        MH-Mail #mh/MH/[]

Comments?

Subject: Pine broken

Pine lets you make mailing lists.

For months I have used pine in the same way and now suddenly it is 
sending error messages.

I have pine mailing lists for friends. Some have only 10 names on them, 
some have perhaps 80.

When I use pine in this way, I send the message to myself and bcc the 
mailing list I have created--inserting the name of my list and letting 
pine then insert all the addresses.

For the past 2 days whenever I bcc more than about 20 addresses, pine 
gives me a "bus error" or "memory fault" error.

This error appears between the "sending message" and "message sent" 
notations. 

And even though it does finally say "message sent," in fact the messages
are not being sent. No one has received them and I have not received the 
copy to myself.

The only way to stop this, is to return to pine and bcc no more than 15 
or 20 people.

Pine always worked fine before with larger numbers of bcc's.

Please help.

We are currently using pine 3.91 and want to use imapd, however when we 
run pine and it goes to retreive the users mailbox on a remote machine it 
always prompts for a userid and password. We have tried both imap and 
rimapd in /etc/inetd and it does the same thing for both situations.

We have a .rhosts file and our users can rlogin into the remote server 
without any problems.

We would prefer it not to prompt for a userid or password. 

Have we done something wrong in the setup or is this the way imap works. 
Please Help.

As of yesterday (but never before), when I put more than 25 addresses
(from one of my pine distribution lists) into a To:, Cc: or Bcc: header of
pine, I get an error message of "bus error" or "memory fault" right after
the "sending message" notation but before the "message sent" notation --
and the message is, in fact, *not* being sent. Please advise.

One of the advantages of using a dedicated IMAP server without shell
access is that we can safely switch to a more efficient format for mail
folders (Tenex).  Without Tenex, the IMAP servers would use much more
memory and do more paging... 

One weakness of Tenex in a shell environment is that the folders look like
ordinary text files, but are very difficult to edit without corrupting
them.  Other mail programs also do not understand Tenex format.  These
together would undoubtedly cause support problems...

Users of the IMAP servers access them from shell accounts on other servers
or from PCs.  In either case, they use local storage on the other machines
for configuration information, etc.

All the programs compiled successfully except Pine.

I'm very new to C on Unix and really hope that someone can help me

Thanks in advance!!!

It is rumored that one interactive user is about equivalent to 3 IMAP 
users.

>  Second, are there other reasons for not allowing shell access?

We wanted to have a dedicated machine that would be highly reliable for
our IMAP server.  Interactive systems have all sorts of nasty
variabilities (e.g. an OS bug triggered by an undebugged user program
could crash the system) that dedicated systems do not.

It all depends upon what you are trying to do.  We prefer to buy a lot of 
smaller cheaper machines than fewer big machines.

This too depends upon the configuration.  It is possible to have 
subscriptions on the IMAP server if you use IMAP for news instead of 
NNTP.

This is also going to become a lot more flexible in the near future.

Pine lets you make mailing lists.

For months I have used pine in the same way and now suddenly it is 
sending error messages.

I have pine mailing lists for friends. Some have only 10 names on them, 
some have perhaps 80.

When I use pine in this way, I send the message to myself and bcc the 
mailing list I have created--inserting the name of my list and letting 
pine then insert all the addresses.

For the past 2 days whenever I bcc more than about 20 addresses, pine 
gives me a "bus error" or "memory fault" error.

This error appears between the "sending message" and "message sent" 
notations. 

And even though it does finally say "message sent," in fact the messages
are not being sent. No one has received them and I have not received the 
copy to myself.

The only way to stop this, is to return to pine and bcc no more than 15 
or 20 people.

Pine always worked fine before with larger numbers of bcc's.

Please help.

Hi,

Does anyone know if there is any version of PC-PINE that runs on DOS.
I'm Looking for a Offline mail that works proerly w/PINE. PC-PINE seems to
be suitable. I want to know if there is any version of pc-pine that works
on XTs.

Thanks,
Arno

Message-Id: <rwocknerD4vvMJ.9Jw@netcom.com>
Date: Fri, 3 Mar 1995 21:27:55 GMT

As of yesterday (but never before), when I put more than 25 addresses
(from one of my pine distribution lists) into a To:, Cc: or Bcc: header of
pine, I get an error message of "bus error" or "memory fault" right after
the "sending message" notation but before the "message sent" notation --
and the message is, in fact, *not* being sent. Please advise.

This ought be obvious, but: how do I configure pine to look in $HOME/inbox
instead of /usr/spool/mail/$USER?  It seems to not look at the MAIL envariable
anymore (I've got 3.89).  The documentation and source code baffles me.
Help would be most appreciated.

The only time my INBOX is updated with new mail is when I do an
eXpunge.  VMS pine updates as new mail arrives on the server.
WinPine is using a remote INBOX.  Is it supposed to update or do
you have to quit and restart or eXpunge to update the INBOX?

Subject: PCPINE3.91 hanging - repost - fruzztrated
Date: 3 Mar 1995 14:53:15 -0500
Message-Id: <3j7s3b$gng@newsbf02.news.aol.com>


I'm using the ncsa packet driver for ne2000.  telnet works fine, so does
ftp.  The name server one the network seems to be functioning properly --
at least ftp uses it, and nslookup works.

So, config.tel seems to be ok, and configtel= is set properly.  PINE seems
to be using it.  When I removed configtel, PINE tries to BOOTP, which
fails.  Put it back, PINE comes up.

But, when I put the {host.domain} in the pinerc path to INBOX, PCPINE_P
can't open the inbox, (error 143, I think) .  If I then go into setup and
configure and change he path to {ip.address}, return and attempt to read
the inbox, pine makes
the connection, and things seem to be fine.

If I then exit PINE, and try to run it again, with the path set to
{ip.address}, it hangs at opening INBOX -- requiring a reset.   If I
manually edit the pinerc file back to {host.domain}, it will at least come
up, although, again, it can't find the INBOX until I go through setup,
etc., etc.

I'd appreciate any suggestions.

Here is my PINERC, and for good measure, my CONFIG.TEL.  I hope you can
see a problem.

Thanks for your time.

Hi!

Can someone tell me how to keep all of the names from showing up
at the top of the message when sending to a distribution list?
Also, is there a way in which pine will announce that mail has arrived besides
biff y?  Thanks,

--Luis Estrada

First look in the source code to see what your global pine 
config variable is called.  By default it is /usr/local/lib/pine.conf
The line in the source code can be found in pine/osdep/os-OSTYPE.h
Add the line 

printer=lpr -Pmyprinter

or whatever to the pine.conf file and voila!  All users' defaults 
have been now set.

Absolutely.  Or you can create a sendmail alias.

Some of my newsgroup folders in Pine 3.91 come up as "does not exist" and 
I can't delete them.  Is there a solution?  Thanks for any help.

Does this function allow PINE to sort incoming email in to specified

to a specific folder that is not the INBOX. Is this possible? Please 
respond via email. Thank you VERY much in advance!

I don't use PINE, but already I don't like it.  Some e-mail I sent to a PINE
user was just inadvertantly posted, by them, to a newsgroup because PINE is 
apparently stupid enough to assume its users want to post e-mail messages 
to newsgroups when the original was a reply to a newsgroup message.

You should change the name to PINEE, "Pine is not even elm"

	One of pine's printer setup options includes just printing to the 
screen.  That should do exactly what your people want it to do.

I have no problem adding to my address book but when I go to put one of 
the new address in to my distrib list I can't quite figured out how this 
is done.

I use a speech synthesizer for screen access and that is where my problem 
lies.  Could one of you all give me the keystrokes for updating a distirb 
list with already exsiting names and how to put a name directly in there?

Thanks nuch...

Go into your address book with an a.  ADd the names you want with the a 
command.  To create a list for the first time, use the s command. You 
will be prompted for the list's full name, nickname, etc.  Once the list 
is created, you add to it with the z command.  You must first cursor 
to the list you want before typing the z command.  Simply enter each 
nickname, pressing enter after each one.  When you're finished, simply 
press enter and you will be back in your address book.  If you're still 
having trouble with your screen access, write to me privately and I'll 
try to help you out.

It's not pine that's stupid, but your friend.  Pine is used as both a
mail and newsreader.  When it sees a newsgroup line, it will PROMPT
the user, and ask if they want to post the article.  Obviously, your
friend replied, 'y'.

No, Pine doesn't support filtering.  Try to use filter or procmail.

Bzzt.  You lose.  PINE is supposed to be a system that naive users can
use, and this is exactly the kind of error a naive user is going to make.
Any system that fails to meet the expected needs of its expected users
is a failure.  PINE was probably designed by programmers -- a fatal 
mistake in a system that is meant to be used by non-programmers.

Naive users are exactly that: people who don't have in-depth knowledge
of the systems they're using -- that's not stupidity, that's people who
have spent their lives doing other things, probably intelligently.

What is stupid is the "the user is an idiot" response that programmers
spew every time their systems fail to meet human needs.

Subject: Problem with pine and vi
Date: 5 Mar 1995 10:47:16 GMT
Message-Id: <3jc4rk$69g@dns.nctsl.navy.mil>

I use pine A LOT.  It's a great program.  The built in editor, pico, is
great but limited.  So I often use the alternate editor function to use
vi. 

About a week or so ago, this stopped working.  When I press ^_ to start 
the alternate editor, the screen displays a message "invoking alternate 
editor" and then "read 999 lines" or however many lines are in the file, 
but then it comes immediately back into pico and redraws my screen.

It seems that vi is either starting and then immediately exiting, or not 
starting at all.  The latter seems more likely.  No hint of vi ever shows 
up on the screen.

Here's what I've tried so far:

-- using various terminal emulators, to make sure I'm really sending a 
^_.  Same thing happens on all systems.

-- rename .exrc in my home directory to run vi without customization.  
Same thing happens, with or without my .exrc.

-- rename .pinerc in my home directory force pine to reconfigure 
itself.   Then make only two config changes in the clean .pinerc:  enable 
alternate editor and editor=vi.  Same thing happens.

-- in a "clean" .pinerc, enable alternate editor implicitly, to force vi 
always.  When you press return after typing in your subject line, the 
screen redraws itself and you are returned to where you started, at the 
end of the subject line.  Can't get to the text at all.

All other functions of pine work normally, and vi works normally when 
invoked from my system prompt.

My host uses pine 3.91 on a sun.

Thank you for your help.

Bashing at some piece of software you never used yourself is just too
easy. If you have a serious comment on its functionality, you can bring
up suggestions here and get a useful discussion out of it.

Anyway, I'll try to answer, based on experience working with Pine. Given
this specific case, Pine will ask you if you really want to post a followup
to the newsgroup, second it will ask if it should reply to all recipients
or just to the sender. IMHO these questions leave very little space for
making the wrong decision.

Actually, I found it very hard to do anything wrong by mistake using Pine.
You mentioned Elm: I've been using Elm for years with great pleasure, but
I've printed out numerous messages when I wanted to move up the the p)revious
message :-) Development of Elm has kind of come to a halt, that's one of the
reasons I moved to Pine. Another is that my users kept asking for it; I can
mention a few more reasons, but there's no intent here to start a religious
war over email user agents.

Yes, I have one compiled for IRIX-4.0.5F, but at the moment
imapd is not working correctly (denies any authentication).
If you have problems compiling by yourself (sure you will
have them - at least I had them ( (-: ) ), send me a mail.

I recently upgraded from Pine 3.89 to Pine 3.91 and now have a problem 
with attachments.  When sending or receiving an ascii file attachment it 
is displayed within the e-mail document itself rather than as an 
attachment.  With 3.89 the file was not displayed in the e-mail document.

How can I correct this problem?

What is more user-friendly than a program ASKING the user what it should
do?  I agree that if pine failed to ask whether a user wanted a newsgroup
reply posted, it would have failed in its user-friendliness. As it is,
however, the program asked the appropriate question, and if the user was
indeed DUMB ENOUGH not to choose Ctrl-G (Get context-sensitive help) when
faced with a question he or she did not understand, then there is NO
defense a program can take. 

Are you saying there should be two queries, the first asking what to do, 
and the second asking "are you SURE"?  A user could enter "yes" both 
times--this is not the solution.  Even in the best-designed program, a 
user can screw him/herself up (just as in everything).

I've been using pine for two years, and I think it is an incredibly
well-designed program, getting better and more flexible with each new
revision.

Subject: Pine Assuming Mailed Replies are News Articles - a solution
Date: 5 Mar 1995 23:54:57 GMT
Message-Id: <3jdj0h$pgk@srvr1.engin.umich.edu>

The authors of Pine thought it would be a good thing for Mail and News to
be treated the same way.  One result of this is that uninitiated users can
very easily post a followup article to a mail reply to a news article. 

This is because Pine assumes that everything that has a Newsgroups header
is a news article.  Anyone who has spent any time studying various news
user agents knows that this is not a valid assumption. 

The Pine authors can take one of two approaches to this problem.  (1) Say,
"If the lusers are too stupid to tell the difference between news and
mail, that's not our problem."  Or (2) come up with different criteria
with which to judge whether something is from news or mail.  I think one 
of these approaches is clearly better than the other.

I suggest that when Pine writes a mail message to an folder, it make a
note that it is mail and not news, and when it writes a news article to an
folder, it make a note that it is news and not mail.  One place to put
this note is in the X-Status line that Pine uses to tell if a
message/article is new, replied-to, etc.  Possible X-Status lines could
look like: 

  []              New mail or news -- fall back on the "Newsgroups" method
  [X-Status: ]    Read mail or news -- fall back on the "Newsgroups" method
  [X-Status: A]   Answered mail or news -- fall back on "Newsgroups" method
  [X-Status: M]   New mail
  [X-Status: N]   New news
  [X-Status: MR]  Read mail
  [X-Status: NR]  Read news
  [X-Status: MA]  Answered mail
  [X-Status: NA]  Answered news

I'm sure I've overlooked something (such as backwards compatibility--but
X-Status isn't a real header anyway), but I think this is a step in the
right direction.  If backwards compatibility is important, then
introducing an entirely new header (X-Is-This-Mail-Or-News) is a solution. 

(Of course if the authors of RFC 850 had choosen Article-ID rather than
Message-ID, it would have been very easy to tell the difference between 
mail and news.  Too late for that, I suppose.)

Hello.  I'm using version 3.91.  Can I use select (;) in the view index

There is a limit of 1000 on a single distribution list.  I'd forgotten 
about that until someone recently ran into it and found a bug.  There is 
a limit of 65000 (or something like that) entries in an address book.  
Both of these limits will be removed in the next version.

It seems to me that there used to be a prompt for the alternate editor in 
Pine 3.89, but there isn't now.  In other words, when I hit ^_, I used to 
get something like

	Edit using alternate editor: emacs

with the cursor positioned after the end of the editor name.  I really 
liked this, because it allowed me to switch editors depending on various 
conditions.  It would also be the easiest way to use ispell.

But now I just get automatic insertion into the alternate editor.  This 
seems to go against the principle of Pine asking you whether you want to 
do something unless you explicitly turn that reminder off.

Am I missing some feature setting somewhere?

We started seeing a similar problem on one our machines since we upgraded to
sendmail 8.6.10.  Our machine is a RS/6000 running AIX 3.2.5.  We are running
Pine 3.91.

I'm guessing that there is a buffer overrun in the new sendmail that is
happening under AIX.  (I haven't seen anyone in comp.mail.sendmail report
similar problems, so this is only a guess.)

Until we can track down the cause, we have been advising people to set their
smtp-server variable to one of our SMTP machines.  This seems to avoid the
problem for now.

Since the exact cause of this problem may be specific to your site, you
should probably contact your local support staff for more information.

Everything worked fine until I moved my installation to another drive.
Now pine v3.89 running on a linux box v1.1.94, gives me a message
"can't open folder lock, access is read only" and then "folder is
open by another process".  I ran ps and saw nothing using the folder.
The help file mentions this problem and suggests another pine is using
the mail folder, but this is not the case here.  My file permissions
seem to be ok.  Anyone else tried to move their installation?
Thanks for any ideas to fix this.

Matt,
I hesitate to perpetuate this thread, since the subject was exhausted 
previously, but nevertheless:

 o It's not the unification of mail and news handling that causes the 
   problem you describe; it has to do with lack of consensus on how the 
   newsgroups header should be used.  (Ex: when you FORWARD a News msg to 
   someone via mail, should the Newsgroups hdr be included in the 822 header
   of the mail message?  I certainly don't think so, but some folks 
   disagree, and many newsreaders do this, perhaps making the debate moot.)

 o Your proposed solution is unworkable because the primary problem has
   to do with message stores (e.g. Inbox) created by other programs, not by 
   Pine.

 o Pine 3.92 will have improvements in this area.

I am wondering if PC-Pine can be used in the following situation.

A LAN has only one Internet email address on a remote computer.  
The mutiple people on the LAN would like to read the list of email
messages saving locally only those that pertain to them while leaving
the rest for the others to read.

Can PC-pine store all Internet email messages in one network accessible
location and allow individuals on the network to save specific
messages from the "spool" to their local machines?

Thanks for your time and considerations

    A temporary (and very workable) solution was posted to
    news.software.readers not long ago.  If you use procmail to sort
    and process your mail, place the following in your .procmailrc as
    the first recipe:

:fhw
^Newsgroups:
| formail -R Newsgroups: X-Newsgroups:

    This will change the Newsgroups: header in any e-mail message that
    has one to X-Newsgroups:, which will prevent Pine from posting the
    reply to the group.  The more knowledgeable can turn on full
    headers with 'h' if they want to see this newsgroups line.

    (BTW, if you're thinking that Pine users couldn't possibly fathom
    procmail, let me assure you that I can't possibly be the only
    counter-example. :)

Justin, the message/question that pine asks is clear enough.  It runs
something to the line of "Do you want to post to the newsgroup?".  I'm
not sure what the default answer is, but if the user doesn't take the
time to read the prompt and just type away, how can you blame the
program.  It's not that the prompt was ambigious.

In-depth knowledge?  You don't need in-depth knowledge to read a line
off the bottom of the screen.  It's in the same place that elm would
ask whether or not you wish to purge the messages marked delete, etc.

>What is stupid is the "the user is an idiot" response that programmers

In this case, it seems justified.  If the user cannot take the time to
read the prompt before hitting <return> or entering their reply, who
are we to blame?  If you have "alias rm 'rm -i -r'" and do a rm * in
your home directory, not read the confirmation message, and just 'y',
are we to blame 'rm'?

I have recently downloaded the 'procmail' mail processing package and 
successfully got it to work. But, I have had trouble integrating any 
'split' mail folders that procmail has created into Pine - it doesn't 
register that any messages arrive! Could someone who has experience using 
both give me some pointers.

Thanks in advance

Subject: Mail, News and Folders?
Date: Sat, 4 Mar 1995 12:41:14 UNDEFINED
Message-Id: <noe.16.0051F10F@io.org>

Unfortunately, I now have 5 internet accounts and I'm trying to consolodate 
all my mail on one account.

I have one account with POP and IMAP servers so I can forward all my mail to 
this account and retreive it with a SLIP POP3 client at home and with PINE at 
the university. However, when I set my inbox to in pine it prompts me for a 
username and password.
I was hoping there is some way I can program PINE to enter my username and 
password automatically so I don't have to type them every time I check my mail.

I also have a similar problem with mail. The account I generally work from at 
the university doesn't have an NNTP server. I have another account that does 
have this but if I set up PINE for that NNTP server I am denied access. Is 
there some way to get pine to enter in a username and password for an NNTP 
server?

Finally, someone told me that you can set up PINE to automatically file new 
messages from a specific address to a specific folder (i.e. you can 
automatically save newslist messages to their own folders). Is this true, and 
if so, how do you do it?

Thanks for any help you can give me,

Well -- this problem has been a topic of discussion in comp.risks and 
alt.current-events.net-abuse, so I'll take that as pseudo-empirical 
evidence that PINE is failing a large number of its users, sometimes 
in ways that seriously compromise their privacy.

Worse -- it compromises the privacy of people like me, who don't use it.

>You mentioned Elm: I've been using Elm for years with great pleasure, but

.. I won't defend Elm.  I use it, but I'm rather a technical sort of person
and Elm meets my needs.  I think the problem with PINE is it is intended for
use by naive users, but makes some assumptions that are contrary to the 
nature of the audience (many naive users don't understand the difference
between e-mail and news, for example; or understand the implications of 
the word "post"). 

You can call naive users "stupid", but it won't save your product:  If you
expect your users to be stupid, your product is a failure unless it 
compensates for stupidity.

Why do people insist on asserting that software is logical and makes 
sense and is therefore OK, even though it is obviously failing its 
intended audience?  

The problem with naive users inadvertently posting private messages to
public newsgroups is so widespread that it has been discussed several
times in comp.risks and alt.current-events.net-abuse -- it's a clear
failure, and no amount of rationalizing will save it.

>...It's in the same place that elm would...

Elm wasn't designed to be used by naive users.  Well, not the same way
PINE was.  Elm work fine for me not because it doesn't suffer from the 
same problems as PINE, but because I'm one of the technical users the
designers of elm were imagining when they created it (or rather, enough
like the designers that the software they designed with no audience 
analysis works for me.)

The software is *always* to blame.  Really, there's no such thing as 
"human error" -- that's a crock made up by system designers so that they
don't have to fix their software to make it usable.

I am using pine to read news as well as mail, and I have a question I 
have not yet figured out. In some newsreaders, when new newsgroups are 
added to your .newsrc, a prompt appears which asks you whether you want 
to subscribe to them. Is there a similar feature in pine? How do pine 
users deal with new newsgroups added (i.e. how do you know they are 
there) ?

I have also seen positngs about FAQs on pine ... where are they ???

We are still using 3.89 due to limitations on our compilation machine.

Recently, the ^_ command has ceased to be recognised...."unrecognised 
command" it says :(  Where might I check in the source to see that I 
haven't removed something stupidly.  The debugs show that I have 
enable-alternate-editor-cmd and that I have an editor defined, but 
still....command not recognised...I'm confused.

Since, as you say, the problem is that the respondent does not
understand what the various options mean, I don't see how this is
going to help.
 
This problem needs fixing, urgently, by technical means.
Appealing to (I'm sorry) clueless newbies to behave properly
is not even a temporary solution, I'm afraid.
 
You may find this difficult to believe, but some people who have
been using email successfully for years have no idea what Usenet
is, and would not understand the meaning of the word "post" in
this sense at all.

This issue has been discussed to death on comp.mail.pine and
comp.mail.headers so I'll try to keep this short.  I agree with Justin
that Pine's interface and behaviour is wrong in this case.   But I also
understand where the Pine team is coming from.  The Newsgroups header
in a news article is well defined - it means this article was posted
to the specified newsgroup(s), but in a mail msg the Newsgroups header
is not well defined (I don't think it's discussed in RFC 822).  Since
Pine is both a mailer and a newsreader they interpret headers to mean
the union of the meanings of headers for mail (RFC 822) and news (RFC
1036).  So, Pine interprets a Newsgroups header as meaning that the
msg was posted and then Pine asks the user if she wants to post, mail,
or post and mail her response.  Problems arise because many
newsreaders, including the ubiquitous trn, tin, and nn, put a
Newsgroups header in msgs that were mailed only.  Now, this is not
necessarily wrong on the part of trn, tin, and nn since they are adding
an undefined header to mail messages, but in retrospect it would have
been better if these newsreaders had used a different header, maybe
something like "X-Originated-In-Newsgroups".  So, technically Pine is
behaving reasonably but IN PRACTICE Pine's behaviour is not reasonable.
Someone on the Pine team posted quite a while ago that a future release
of Pine will make it more clear to the user what the 3 options are
(post only, mail only, post & mail) and have the default be mail only.
In the meantime my recommendation to people who use trn, tin, nn or
any other newsreader that includes a Newsgroups header in mailed-only
messages is to include a note that says something like "This is a
private email message. Please do not post it."

Hope this is helpful,
Nancy

Another possiblility is this procmail recipe:

:0 fhw
* !^Message-Id:.*Pine
* ^Newsgroups:
| formail -R Newsgroups: X-Newsgroups:

which only changes the Newsgroups header in non-Pine messages.  Since
a Newsgroups header in a Pine message means that the message was
indeed posted, it's ok for Pine to ask about posting responses to
these messages.

this is the known behavior for current versions of client (Pine or
ECSmail) and server (PMDF IMAP). Basically to get at new mail messages in
VMS MAIL, the server has to close the folder, and reopens it again. This
is an expensive operation which when done automatically every 2.5 minutes
on a large mailbox with hundreds or thousands of messages is not very
"friendly". Pine does not close or reopens the folder explicitly, and the
IMAP server does not do it implicitly. So the folder is not updated. 

Currently if you eXpunge the folder, then the server is forced to reopen 
it so you do get the new messages. (this will still be true in the future)

Techincally, let's say I had 177 messages in my inbox, and 64 of which 
are NEW (RECENT or unread) when I opened it from Pine. Then I got a new 
message. On Pine, I pushed the down arrow at the last message, and 
Pine issues the NOOP command, to which PMDF's IMAP server 
responds with the number of RECENT (unread) messages, and the number of 
messages in the folder as
* 177 EXISTS
* 65 RECENT

the number of EXISTS messages is not changed because the server's internal
state of the folder is not changed. The number of RECENT messages is
something the server got from the VMS MAIL's newmail count, which is a
separately obtainable without having to close/reopen the folder. 
Apparently the answer is not enough to trigger Pine to know there are new 
messages.

I would imagine Pine will be updated to use the CHECK command when the 
user forces a new mail check. PMDF's IMAP server is updated in the next 
version of PMDF to close and reopens the folder when the CHECK command is 
received.

	Just curious, do you think a newbie or an unelightened email

What Pine is assuming is that the Newsgroups: header has the meaning
defined in RFC 1036--that it lists the newsgroup or newsgroups in
which the message belongs.  The problem is that various news user
agents sometimes use that header for a completely different purpose.

The primary difference between news and mail, their transport systems,
is but an implementation detail.  The two are fundamentally the same
thing and manipulate the same objects, modulo differing requirements
placed on the set of headers by the transport systems.

Pine is hardly the first user agent to combine news and mail, it is
certainly going to be the last.  In such agents, it is normal to have
a folder containing some messages received through the mail transport
system and others received through the news transport system.  It is
unreasonable to expect such systems to detect which messages are
"news" and which are "mail" in order to figure out how to interpret
any given header field.

The correct solution is to not make field-names context sensitive.
User agents should not create Newsgroups: headers that do not have a
meaning other than that defined by RFC 1036 or its successors.

I just have to jump in on this discussion.  Pine is fantastic.  It has
been a lifesaver in teaching newcomers how to use email.  I started out
last year with unix mail and it was so hard for me, who had never used
computers at all.  Pine was so much simpler, and yes, it is for naive
newbies.  

This year I have helped many new teachers and students on internet
learn to use pine.  It is a wonderful program.

Specifically, as several others have pointed out, it asks you
if you want to post to the newsgroup.  That is pretty plain for
even the most naive.  But just in case it's not, pine also warns
you, "posted message may go to thousands of readers.  post it?"
Surely anyone, if not sure what that means, would say no, if not
intending to send it to thousands of folks....

It seems to me, that you have been embarrassed by someone's "accidental"
post to a newsgroup (maybe it was intentional?)....and are taking it
out on the makers of pine.  Something new users around here are
often warned about is that email is NOT totally private.  Once you
send something, it may end up anywhere, and you should consider
that when you send it.

I not only love pine, but I love this newsgroup, because up until
this thread, it has been one of the most pleasant flame-free
newsgroups I have had a chance to read.

Thought I'd pass on a couple solution that I encountered while installing
PC-Pine under windows and with PCNFS:

Running under DOS with PCNFS: 
Problem: Unknown Host

I have managed to get PC-Pine for PCNFS to run under DOS, it was unable
to locate the remote host but I freed up some main memory - it now has 
5603k and it works fine (thanks to Clinton Bittel). 


Running under Windows with winsock.dll:
Problem: Hangs opening INBOX

Unfortunately, the Windows winsock version will not run. It hangs while
trying to open INBOX.

I upgraded the winsock.dll to Dec. 25, 1993  24576B and it no longer hangs.

You may want to try a more recent version, but I've got to worry about
whether it will work with my sqllink drivers.

I see four questionable assumptions here:

1. The meaning of the Newsgroups: header according to RFC 1036 applies
   to email.
2. News and email are fundamentally the same thing.
3. It is reasonable that software should discard useful
   out-of-band information.
4. Established practice means nothing.

We are a local ISP running BSDI UNIX and Pine 3.89. We are looking for a 
way to autoreply to requests for information, with the ability to capture 
the incoming addresses for future follow up. Three questions 1) what is the 
best program out there to do the process, and 2)does pine have a function 
to do this that we are missing. 3)is the source code available in case we 
want to hack somthing slightly different ourselves?
as always e-mail appreciated, over posts, but either will do. Thanks

 I see that you are on Netcom. I have the exact same problem. I have 9 
distribution lists of 90 names each. Since Mid December I have been using 
the lists to send my stock report each market day without major problems. 
Starting last thursday I began getting inquiries as to "what happened to 
the report??" .  Since I run batch files I was not aware of the error 
messages until tonight. I ran the lists one at a time and each time got 
either a "memory fault" or a "bus error" message.  I called Netcom 
earlier this evening and was told to try the NUGLOPS Pine "Vers 3.91"
They also suggested that I get on the Netcom computer with the lightest load.

  I tried this without success, so I aclled back.  I was told that 
someone who is failiar with Pine will call me back tommorrow. Like you, I 
am able to send small lists without problem.

Thankyou for reading my mail...

O.K. I wish to establish a .sig

I used pico to edit a file and I saved it   .sig   in my home directory.
It must be there..because I can control r (retrieve the file) manually.

So therefor I have created a file in my home directory called .sig


Now ..when I send a mail to myself...it does not pick it up..

What am I doing wrong or what have I not done..????


a bit of info..

Now in the Pine config....it says in the signiture bit...

<no set value> using ".sig"   (or something similar)

is that the right command,,or what should I have here..


Please,,, please   someone be kind enough to email me..

saratoga@pyromania.apana.org.au

And please remember I am a newbie...and I mean a newbie..
So real basic language please..

I appreciate anyone who trys to asisst me...

Thankyou for taking interest,

Sean Neylon.....

Or to delete the Newsgroups: header prior to mailing the response.  That
would be the only foolproof method, right?

Indeed, I might just make that patch to my already customized tin.
Remove inclusion of the Newsgroups: header, but include the References:
header.  That and get it to stop automatically including Followup-To:
headers that have the same contents of the Newsgroups: header.  And...
well, I'm rambling now.

Well, I could at least see your point up until that last one.  If
programmers aren't supposed to design it, then who is?  What is it
that you think programmers do, anyhow?  I'm not going to say that all
aspects of PINE are just peachy-keen, but I know a lot of non-programmers

very flat.

Design people maybe?

I'm a programmer, and honestly, I couldn't distinguish a good UI from a
bad one to save my life. I know what *I* like, but what I like and what
works for everybody are, more often than not, two somewhat different
things. The best programs are the ones that combine both. I think Pine
does a very admirable job in this respect (its handling of the Newsgroups
header notwithstanding), because I like it, *and* the non-technical people
here like it. 

I think one way to "fix" the Newsgroups problem is to allow disabling of
the news-posting capability altogether when I compile the program. (Is
this already possible?) That would at least cut down on its size *and*
circumvent this confusion entirely. Force the user to use a different
package to post news. That's what I would like to do when/if I install
Pine 3.91 here for general consumption. 

I disagree with Justin's point, but I can see very clearly where it comes 
from.

I wouldn't want to see it as a compile time option, but could see it
disabled as a default, and one would have to enable it thru setup.  But
in the interim, I liked someone else's suggestion of post, mail, both or
however it was actually worded.

Try renaming .sig to .signature.  That should do what you want.

Subject: PC_PINE/WATTCP.CFG hangs trying to open INBOX -  help!
Date: 7 Mar 1995 11:45:41 -0500
Message-Id: <3ji2jl$2k4@newsbf02.news.aol.com>



I'm using DOS 5.0 and the ncsa packet driver for ne2000.  ncsa telnet
works fine,
so does ftp.  The name server on the network seems to be functioning
properly --
at least ftp uses it, and nslookup works.  So, the network seems to be ok.

Having failed also with CONFIG.TEL,
I'm trying to use WATTCP.CFG.  PC_PINE hangs trying to open the INBOX.

I'd appreciate any suggestions.

Here is my PINERC and WATTCP.CFG.  I hope you can
see a problem.

Thanks for your time.

Now that the decwrl.dec.com gateway from Pine to newsgroups has been

another way, is it possible to mail to newsgroups from Pine and, if so
how do you do it, please?)

This happened to me, although with different network drivers, my solution 
was to make room in main memory. Shoot for 560k

Is there any way to attach a warning label for BCC messages, to
alert the receiver?  Currently, there is no such warning, and
the receiver may not "catch' the fact that he/she is being
blind-carbon-copied on the message.

An example of such a warning label would be:

-------------- BLIND CARBON COPY MESSAGE -------------


Thanks,

Got the archive from HP repository, compile and install work fine, but first
time I try to compose a note:

/lib/dld.sl: Unresolved symbol: vtinit (code)  from bin/pinebin

and it dies a horrible death?????

I played with the TERMIO defs in os-hpp.h but the default is as good as it
gets. Left it the default.

using hp-ux 9.04 and dld.sl:
	SMART_BIND
	Revision 1.126

This looks like it should be a very simple problem to fix, HELP!!!!!

Thanks,

Ignoring whether or not your solution is desirable, it certainly is not
feasible in practice and therefore cannot be a correct solution.

Date: 7 Mar 1995 14:02:10 -0600
Message-Id: <3jie42$t6s@pentagon.io.com>

How does Pine determine the distribution of messages posted to usenet?
This isn't exaclty an _IO_ question.  I am posting from pine at another
site, but the posts only show up in newsgroups at that site, not here
or anywhere else.  I tried adding "Distribution:" as a customized header,
but pine is stripping it from the outgoing messages.  It doesn't strip
X-Headers, however.

Any information is appreciated.

Greetings: I would like to get some information on Unix FAX software. 
I am looking for either commercial or shareware fax software that either
runs standalone or can be accessed thru Pine. My user wants to be able
to e-mail and fax people hopefully by entering their fax address in the Pine
address book.
Can anyone shed some light on available software or ideas?

Thanks

Precisely.  Even though news and mail are, at a technical
level, extremely similar messaging systems, those who use
them tend to treat them as oil and water.  It is imperative
that the tools used to handle mail and news be capable of
making an equally strong distinction; even though the user
may want to do many similar things to both media, it can be
catastrophic to confuse one for the other.

Of course.  It is not beyond imagining that perhaps the Pine
client could insert a header into each message describing
its original (and therefore default) disposition -- a
PINE-Status header, if you will, describing whether the
message originated from news or mail (or some other source).

In fact, the mail agent I currently use, MM, does rather a
similar thing in order to keep store MM-specific concepts in
a Berkeley-format mailbox.  And, oh! by some miracle of
coincidence, one of the co-authors of MM was Mark Crispin!
Fancy that.

Unfortunately, RFC 1036 defines headers for NEWS, but NOT FOR MAIL. In
a mail message, "Newsgroups" is undefined. It has NO meaning. At worst,
it has ONLY the meaning the agent who puts it in wants it to have.
Unfortunately, Pine's assumption about what other systems meant is not
correct, and it leads to problems, and the Pine people know this but
adamantly refuse to change or fix the program.

The objects they manipulate are fundamentally different, as can be
evidenced by the fact that people complain that their mail was posted.
If it's the same, barring transport mechanism, why do people complain?

You may use them for the same thing, and that is fine. I don't care if you
drive screws with a hammer, but that doesn't make a screwdriver and a hammer
fundamentally the same thing.

>Pine is hardly the first user agent to combine news and mail, it is

I hope so. At least, any that DO follow would do well to learn from Pine's
mistakes and know which headers are defined and which aren't.

That's silly. The agent put the messages in the folders, it can
remember how the message arrived. ("Gee, I used NNTP to fetch this
thing, I'll bet it's news.") Since some news headers are undefined for
mail, it really does need to know which is which.

Mail user agents are not bound by news user agent RFC. It would be nice
if "newsgroups" headers didn't show up in anything but news, but they
do and will continue to do so until someone goes to every site in the
world and replaces the software there. Are you volunteering?

What we CAN say about the correct solution is that it is NOT "screw
anyone who's mail software doesn't obey the news RFC".

Unless RFC 822 *prohibits* the word "Pine" from appearing in a Message-ID

No, they're using biff.  Type "man biff".  The Jargon File can explain

Subject: Reading WP 5.1 file into Pine
Date: 8 Mar 1995 02:24:51 GMT
Message-Id: <3jj4hj$hb0@everest.pinn.net>

I would like to know the correct way to read this type of ASCII text file 
into the body of a email message----I use (Pine 3.91).

When I put (^R) read rather long files inside Pine it gets to be a pain 
to have to move the cursor to the beginning of the text file and do a ^J 
format (justify) all the way down to eliminate word wrap, double spaces, 
control characters, etc. 

Is there a better way to do this?
 
TIA,
Thomas S. Cole

Subject: How to automatically expire listserv mail?
Date: 7 Mar 1995 18:55:10 -0500
Message-Id: <3jirou$k6@acmey.gatech.edu>


Hi,
	I asked alt.config to make alt.alumni.nc-school-s+m  for students
who went to the North Carolina School of Science & Math for 11th and
12th grade.  Well, they told me "no" and a listserv was the way to go.   Is
there another option besides a Newsgroup, listserv, WWW newsgroup?  

	If I go with listserv and GaTech and NCCSM won't do the listserv, 
is there a site that will support it?   I know procmail and filter can 
send the mail off to certain folders.

Can one get a listserv to act like a newsgroup in pine? 
Can one set up something that automatically deletes listserv messages
if read, too old, or the file gets too big?
Can we get Pine to not show read messages?

Or can we fool a news reader into thinking a listserv is a newsgroup?


Thanks....ListServ seems like a crappy choice for a "social" group,
Chris

If you are talking about Yehavi's port of PINE for VMS, from HUJI,
then please look for the file README.VMS and follow its instructions.
 
You'll need to get a couple of things right - default-fcc is another.
Read my other followup (posted yesterday) if you want more detail.

Try "ps agux|grep <insert your username here>" instead.  Hope this helps.

WADR, I think the point is that, where there is a need for BCC, there is 
a need for the BCC recipients to know that the TOs and CCs don't know 
that the BCCs have a copy.  

A couple of reasons we use BCC are:
-  Don't was TOs and CCs to know about the BCCs for CYA reasons
-  Don't want to provide a list of email contacts besides sender and 
   limited CCs.

If it is really important that the BCCs know they are being blind copied, 
we forward a copy of the message TO them, prepending a note explaining 
that the following message was sent... and they are being provided with a 
blind copy.

Today when I opened a previous read mail in Pine and went to reply to the

Any ideas?

Hello Pine-Info:

I saw this question on the list a couple of weeks ago, but don't remember 
seeing a response.  I apololgize for re-posting it:

I have users who are using a Mac Plus with no control key.  Is there an 
alternate keystroke?

Thanks,

Subject: Malformed news posting
Message-Id: <CMM.0.90.4.794677095.brennan@watsun.cc.columbia.edu>

A user of pine 3.91 on our system has got automated messages from a
site in Chicago claiming his usenet posts have malformed headers for
followup messages.  We don't know what the problem is.

Unusual factors: Our news system has had history file problems, and
disk full problems.  Because of the disk full problem, the messages
that ended up getting this warning were postponed and then continued
before posting.  Could the postponing lose the information that the
posting is a followup?

I wonder why no one else is getting the same automated message.  No
one else postpones and retries?  No one else tells us?  Unknown.

Hello, all
We have installed pine 3.91 on our SunOS4.1.x and it runs great.  The only
problem is when we try to run it on a pc with the wyse50 terminal emulator or
on a wyse50 terminal using the unix host, the look of pine changes. The arrow
keys don't work properly and some other problem as well.  Is  pine not suppose
to work with the wyse50 terminal emulator and if not is there a way around it.

Thanks so much for any respond....

-Sue

I'm a happy fxvision customer.  Very nice.  I've never tried to use it

I can think of a couple of things to try.  Format the document with 
margins narrow enough to avoid triggering the word wrap function.  Save 
the document as DOS text (this may leave you with double line spacing) 
before you insert the document into your message, and avoid the control 
and formatting characters (your message implied to me that you were 
working with the document in WP format).

After you insert the document, postpone the message.  My recollection is 
that when you resume a postponed document, you are placed at the 
beginning of the message.

I'm using the winsock version of pine and adding remote folders to 
folder-collections, I'm also enabling expanded folders. The folder names 
are displayed with their optional titles and designation as remote but 
they are displayed as empty lists. 

If I goto these folders they come up normally. Any ideas?

You can skip this step.  Just use ^W^Y to position to beginning fo file

Should it be?  Probably not.  But the relevent question is, "Is it
prohibited?"

In those cases, fall back upon the "Newsgroups method."  Or preferably, a
header that is less likely to occur in a mail message.  (How about Path?)

Good.  Now if my admins would just upgrade from 3.87...

This is probably a problem with your mail server.  It could be inserting
extra characters at the beginning of the second message ("new piece"
above) which cause Pine (IMAP, whoever does the work at that point) to not
recognize the beginning of a message.  The second message is seen as part
of the first message.  I can't solve your problem, but if you tell your
admins about it, maybe they can.

Wayne State University is considering using Pine as its mail agent for 
the entire student population (30000).  If there are other universities 
that have done this, we'd like to know about your experiences.  Feel free 
to email me directly, or post here.

Message-Id: <3jkfoe$hhi@newsbf02.news.aol.com>

If you have had success using the ncsa packet driver and NE2000 NIC with
PC_PINE, please let me know.  I would appreciate seeing your pinerc file
and your wattcp.cfg or config.tel file, whichever you are using, as well
as an idea of the free conventional ram your running it under..  I have
not been able to get them to work together.  I suspect it cannot be done
and I'm going to have to find another NIC.  This is sad as we already own
several NE2000 type cards.

BTW --- on the same machine, all the same hardware, running linux, pine
works very well, going to the same IMAP server.  I wish I could stay in
linux.  But I'm trying to set up a system for about 20 DOS/Windows users
and I need a solution for that side.  Any suggestions would be
appreciated.

	I don't have any ideas, as I have the same trouble, posted here, and
got the most audible silent response I've ever experienced.  I've written the
Pine development team (see reporting bugs in the docs), but only got an
automated response from their machine saying they did receive the message.

	If no one here has any idea what's going on, I'd send them another
email so they don't chalk it up to MY stupidity...

I'm using PINE3.91  under linux 1.0.9.  I am able to select a newsgroup

following sequence appears in the pine-debug file.

Post failed, continuing

-------------------------

I tried inews -h on the server.
It returned the message "Warning Can't connect to server -- Article will
be spooled"
Nothing appeared in syslog

-------------------------------

I did telnet 119 -- then mode reader -- then post, got an OK then entered
the headers, a body, and then ^D -- (several) -- nothing happened - then I
got a 503 timeout.  syslog had a message from nnrpd about a timeout.

I put the server into the hosts.nntp, no change.  nnrp.access has Read

Any suggestions?

You could ^R in the header (for rich header) and then on the
Bcc: (Blind Copy) line, put your list alias. This will send mail
to all people on list, but will not show who gets it.

I also got the "can't open folder lock, access is read only" and then
"folder is : open by another process" message.  I didn't have any
problems getting the process id, but nothing happened when I typed "kill
(number)" and I ended up waiting a week for the system to kill the
process.  What happened?

Do an

There will be a file called .sig, .Sig, .Signature, .signature, or

rm .filename

This will take care of that. Alternatively, you can edit the .pinerc
file and remove the reference to above file.

David,
It would be helpful if you included the folder-collections entry from your

That's ridiculous, since the context in which the
"Newsgroups" header is being used is electronic mail.  The
mail standards don't define any "Newsgroups" header at all,
so any agent which ascribes meaning to that header in a mail
message is playing a dangerous game.

Furthermore, given that it has been standard practice for
years to include a "Newsgroups" header in a private response
to a Usenet post, it is downright foolish for an agent to
apply a meaning to that header that differs from the one
commonly in use.  It makes Pine the Humpty Dumpty of mail
agents.

You may be right.  But we're stuck with it anyway, and
obstinately insisting that it's a bad idea doesn't change
the fact that we have to deal with it in a practical manner.
Pine doesn't.

Now that this is the third time around on this subject, I know it's
hopeless trying to change anyone's mind, so I'll just stick to 
correcting the factual error above: 

 Pine does not ascribe any meaning or make any assumptions about 
the meaning of a "Newsgroups:" header line. It asks the user what
he/she wants to do about it. ( And then it asks "are you sure..." )

 It is the fact that there is no standard context-free meaning for 
the "Newsgroup:" line that makes it impossible for Pine to make any
assumptions - which would be real useful, as it could then prevent
users from asking it to do the "wrong" thing ( or at least ask them
ONE MORE TIME: "are you sure..." ) 

 It is the fact that some news readers sometimes chose to use a 
non-standard usage and semantics for the "Newsgroups:" line that 
makes it impossible for ANY program to automatically ascribe a single 
meaning to the existence of that line. It's meaning is ambiguous: 
The message might be a News posting or it might be a private message
in reply to a public new posting ( or it might have been sent via 
both channels. ) So the only reasonable action for any program is to
ask the user to decide, based perhaps on other clues in the message text.
[ Which is exactly what Pine does - *it* does not ascribe meaning to that
header line - the user does. ] 


 REPEAT: Pine does NOT assume mailed replies are news articles.

Using the same field-name as a header defined in RFC 1036 for a
completely different purpose than defined in that document is an
extremely bad idea.  It is the root cause of this problem.

People complain because their messages were sent to places that they
did not intend (even though they responded "yes" to two prompts that
warned them this would happen).

The message did not necessarily arrive via NNTP, it could have been
fetched through, say, IMAP.  The user could have copied the message
from a "news" folder to one of their personal folders in a previous
session.  The user could have saved the message to a file and loaded
it back in somehow.

Is anyone volunteering to replace all the B News sites still out
there?  Anyone volunteering to replace all the software that still
generates 2-digit years in Date headers?

Just because a practice is widely deployed does not make it correct or
desirable.  It is not going to be feasable to build/maintain a Maginot
line between "news" objects and "mail" objects, a practice of using
the same field-names to mean completely different things in the two
contexts is going to cause many more problems than just the one being
complained about in this thread.

Date: Wed, 8 Mar 1995 21:27:06 GMT

I have been running Pine 3.91 on a SCO wide area network for several 
months.  It has been very successful .. the users love it and we have had 
no problems (implentation and utilization!).

Now, however, I want to integrate those users who operate in in an 
exclusively Windows environment.  They are tied to the net via winsock 
and have Unix accounts for receiving mail.

I have done several things so far.  I added the pre-compiled SCO imapd, 
ipop2d, ipop3d to my inetd.conf file.  Added the line 
inbox-path={host-name)INBOX to my local pinerc file. Ran PC-Pine and 
failed!  I get a connection refused error.  Trumpet reports "Task XXXX 
did not call WSACleanup" after it's report of gethostbyname.

I have printed out all the doc on imap from the pine distribution .. but 
it appears to be slanted towards persons *developing* additional 
capabilities.

Does anyone have a step-by-step "how-to" on configuring imap or an 
alternative.  The end product I am looking for is a Windows interface to 
the users mailbox on the UNIX host.

signed -- deeply frustrated

PS -- I have confirmed that winsock is talking to the net and more 
specifically *can* ping the host I have imapd activated(?) on.

Hey ... lookee this.  Yesterday I moved somebody's mail to their home
directory because they had like a 3 MB mail file.  Today I get a message
saying that they can't read their mail in pine (the inbox-path variable is
unset.) When moving their mail, we add a line like "setenv MAIL
$HOME/.newmail" to their .login file so that mailers can find their mail
file.  [Two questions arise from this ... #1: Why doesn't PINE look for a
MAIL variable? and 2: Why doesn't PINE do a 'ypcat aliases' type command to
find redirected mail?] So anyway, I decided to do a little experimenting.  I
don't have a $MAIL variable set (because I know how to delete and move mail)
and I set 'inbox-path=$MAIL' in my .pinerc file.  I exited pine and restarted
it, and it found my mail no problem.  Coolness, I say, I'll stick this in
/yachtlocal/lib/pine.conf (the 'global' .pinerc file.) I exit pine and
whenever I try to run it,

=>- cut -<=
sloop ccurtis 16: vi pine.conf
sloop ccurtis 17: cd  
/ketch_unison/users/undergrad/ccurtis
sloop ccurtis 18: pine


Bug in Pine detected: "Received abort signal".
Exiting pine.
sloop ccurtis 19: pine -r


Bug in Pine detected: "Received abort signal".
Exiting pine.
sloop ccurtis 20: pine


Bug in Pine detected: "Received abort signal".
=>- cut -<=

Removing this line from the file makes PINE work again.  To reiterate, it
only does this if the setting is in the global config file.  So I guess my
question is, when is Pine 3.92 coming out?  And, will Pine begin looking at
/etc/aliases and/or the $MAIL variable? 

I think I've asked this before, but gotten no response. 

Oh, and another thing, I sometimes get messages from people that were sent to
me and posted to usenet.  Apparently all they have to do is when posting the
message, add a CC: line to myself.  I've tried this in Pine, and it seems to
work, but it'd be nice to have pine ask "Would you like to send a copy
directly to the poster as well?" instead of me having to retype the address. 
Anyone else have any thoughts on this?

Bzzt.  By ``not correct,'' I have to assume that you mean ``not
something that I agree with.''

Eh?  I have a big system and messages arrive from all over the place,
more than just ``mail'' and ``news''.  They use a common representation
(the basic RFC 822 header/body separation, the basic RFC 822 mechanism
to separate the individual headers).  Differences are encapsulated by
those headers as they need to be.  Convince me that the difference is
truly important.

> What we CAN say about the correct solution is that it is NOT "screw

Another oversight.  By ``correct'' I have to read ``pragmatic.'' 
``Correct'' is a powerful word and it doesn't help to over-use it; it's
just inflammatory.

Who uses them as ``oil and water''?  Maybe some folks, sure.  But it's
not fair to go from a wishy-washy statement about ``those who use them
tend to treat'' to ``it is imperative.''

Let's cut the high-handed rhetoric.  This topic has had more than its
share of heat for its amount of light.  If there are technical points to
make, let's make them but leave the flame-talk at home.

I am using Pine 3.91 (in Norway)
I would like to use the norwegian characters æøå and ÆØÅ. (They might not appear
right, but should be oslash, aring, etc. (ae, oe, aa).
I have therefore configured Pine to use:

character-set          = iso-8859-1                                             

When i recieve mail from a person with these letters in his/her name, it
appears like this:

From: =?iso-8859-1?Q?Bj=F8rn_Ole_Fredrik_=D8deg=E5rd?=
     <olebj@hnoss.ifi.uio.no>

When i type these letters in the message body or receive mail containing them, they
do not appear at all on screen, but the  letters ARE there, because the recipient can
read them in mail from me, and when i export my incoming mail, they appear in the
text file.


Any solutions?

in that messages stored in this format are a fixed size, whereas 
Berkeley's can change size as they are read, replied to, etc.

I *presumed* that this would lead to savings in memory usage if Clever 
Things were being done to take advantage of this consistency in size.

So I doing some tests using Pine first with the mboxdriver (which uses
Berkeley format) and then the Tenex driver.  I performed these first on 
an empty INBOX, then on one with 78 messages totalling around 350Kb.

When Pine had finished opening the INBOX I used a "ps -elf" to check the 
total size of the process (the SZ value) and its resident set size (the 
RSS value - pages actually in memory).

For the non-empty INBOX at that early point (straight after the INBOX had
finished opening) the Tenex version was using *more* resident memory than
the mboxdriver/Berkeley coutnerpart (327 pages v 299 pages, where 1 page =
4Kb)

Could someone confirm whether or not there *are* advantages to using 
Tenex format, and if so what they tend to be (memory, disk I/O, CPU usage, 
etc)?

(I realise that the test I did were very simplistic and may well be giving
misleading results, but I'd hoped that they'd give a general indication of
memory usage.)

Tangential issue here.  How it arrived is irrelevant;  what it *is* is
relevant.  News is News so long as it is in the News spool area.  As
soon as a user moves it into his private collection, it has been
converted into email.  Replies to this email should be private.  A user
who wishes to participate in News follows up (not 'replies') to what is
News, not what has been converted into email.  A user who wishes to
reply (not 'follow up') to email may reply to email, but may also reply
to News.

It doesn't matter if it arrived via IMAP.  If it's in the News spool
area, it's News, and if it's in the users' private area, it's email
(possibly converted from email).

Let me say this again:

     Once a News posting is moved into a user's private files, it is
     no longer News.  It has been converted into email.  It should be
     treated accordingly.  Do not post any followups to it.

Oh, by the way, there are established terms 'reply' and 'follow-up'
that clearly distinguish between the two actions.  Let's not cause
confusion by calling everything a reply.

Not so.  There is nothing religious about this.  These things ought to
be decided on merit.

The people who claim that News and email are fundamentally the same
thing are looking at only part of the picture.  The people who claim
that News and email are different are looking at the whole picture.

The truth is that News and email have some commonalities and some
differences.  

The differences are rather critical.  If they were not, we would not
see so many complaints about email being accidentally converted into
News.  QED.

>How can we

Coexistence is not the problem.  The real problem is that pine is
discarding out-of-band information, and thus losing track of whether
a file contains News or email.  New and email can coexist quite
nicely -- if you keep track of what is what.

>1) Add a header which is a modal switch to the rfc822 format

This is technically the correct solution.  However, the 'type' header
should be added not by the sending software (which already knows the
'type', as does the transport protocol), but by 

   the receiving software
   
   at the point where it is about to discard the out-of-band
   information that distinguishes between News and email.
   
This out-of-band information can be converted to in-band information in
the form of a 'type' header.

Transferring out-of-band information into in-band information at the
destination is not a new idea.  Most email delivery agents already do
this for the envelope sender, by saving it as a Return-Path header, and
many email delivery agents do it for the envelope recipient, by saving
it in a Received: header, when doing so is known not to violate Bcc:
privacy.

Surely those who insist that News and email are the same thing would be
willing to use some of the mechanisms used by email (but not currently
by News...wonder why...) to achieve similar goals?

>2) Define a new header to mean "newsgroups from which this discussion
>originated".

Already have it:  It's 'Newsgroups:'.

>3) Define a new header to mean "although this was sent by email, it
>was also posted to the following newsgroups".

Already have this information:  Combination of out-of-band information
(type = News) and Newsgroups: header.

>4) both 2 & 3, and deprecate use of "newsgroups" in mail.

Requires change in established practice, and will take too long
to happen.  Not a good idea.

Disagree -- see response to (2).

This discussion accomplishes nothing positive.  I suggest that it be 
dropped.

The gist of the technical issue is this: there is no reliable way to
determine what is "news" and what is "mail" to establish modal behavior.
If there is anyone who in sincerely interested in the technical details, I
will be happy to explain. 

There have been a great number of suggestions on how to deal with the
problem, for which we are grateful; unfortunately some of these are
infeasible due to technical considerations.  We have already deployed
several of the feasible suggestions.  These will be in Pine 3.92.

We are also actively investigating certain others, including a clever
means (if it works -- not yet verified) of distinguishing between
non-posted email from tin (et al) and postings.  It isn't yet certain 
whether this will be in 3.92; the jury is still out on whether or not 
the particular trick in question will work.

Two very vocal individuals, at ORST.EDU and RAHUL.NET, seem to feel that
by filibustering newsgroups and mailing lists, they can eventually beat
those who disagree into submission.  They also seem to feel that sending
abusive email will give them their way.  I no longer read, much less
answer, mail from these individuals.

I have a number of old terminals that require a space on the screen to
represent video attributes. They are not able to use the
protected-mode reverse video trick that works on Wyse. As a result,
the cursor position is incorrect once highlight characters have been
used, and the screen is scrambled. Has anyone found a solution to this
problem? I've looked through the last year of pine-info, and seen
references to setting assume-slow-line, with the idea that this would
disable reverse video and replace it with an arrow. However, while
this can be done in elm, I don't see any effect in pine, nor any use
of the line speed affecting tty output.

I was wondering if there was a pine mailing list that just stuck to 
pine... help and better ways to use pine...

i'm not interested in buying a 1 gig drive from these fools, or someone's 
mountain bike.... the mkpgp posts were a little more to my liking.

if such a mailing list exists, please give me the address because I get 
so much junk mail from this one that i have had to send it all to 
/dev/crap until I get more time to read junk mail, which means that I might 
miss any useful posts.   [ln -s /dev/null /dev/crap]

I have gotten some good information from this list... i'm not trying to 
trash the list; just get less than 80 emails a day [almost half of which 
come from here.]

thanx in advance for any information you can offer.

The recent discussion have demonstrated that there are two religions:

1) News and email are fundamentally different.
  and
2) News and email are essentially the same.

It is clear that both models exist and likely that both will continue to
exist for some time.  Given that religious issues can't be resolved by
discussion, we should move on to solve the technical problem: How can we
make these two models co-exist with the least pain?

Solutions I've heard suggested are as follows:

1) Add a header which is a modal switch to the rfc822 format
indicating a "type" (news or mail), which changes the meanings of
other headers.

2) Define a new header to mean "newsgroups from which this discussion
originated".

3) Define a new header to mean "although this was sent by email, it
was also posted to the following newsgroups".

4) both 2 & 3, and deprecate use of "newsgroups" in mail.

Personally, I find (1) overly complex for implementors.  I believe (2)
is a reasonable solution.

If you consider these messages (which presumably include Usenet postings)
as just files with no semantics, then of course they are all the same
thing.  Likewise, /vmunix and /usr/man/man1/csh.1 are the same
thing --- just files.

Once you begin to consider the semantics of the data in these files,
and what people will *do* with them, and what they will *think*
while they do it, you begin to realize the differences.

Why is it considered a breach of netiquette to post private email
to Usenet? 

>Who uses them as ``oil and water''?  Maybe some folks, sure.  

How about:  Everybody who is complaining about private email being
posted to Usenet?  

If these complainers are such an insignificant minority of such little
importance that we can dismiss them with a comment like 'Maybe some
folks, sure', then why are we even arguing?  Ignore the problem and
that's the end of it!

I am new to this mailing list.  If this subject has been covered already, 
I apologize in advance.

I am running Pine3.91 on an SCO Open Server machine.  The implementation 
has been a wonderful success.  I am now trying to expand the 
implementation to include PC-PINE for winsock.

My winsock installation appears to be solid and functional,  but 
accessing my inbox on the SCO machine has proven to be no easy matter.  I 
have added the pre-compiled imapd (427500K Oct 21 11:00) that came with 
the pine-3.91.tar for SCO to my inetd.conf file:

	imapd stream tcp nowait root /etc/imapd imapd

The /etc/imapd file looks like this:

	-rwx--x--x 1 bin bin 427500 Mar 08 09:41 /etc/imapd

I have added it to my /etc/services:

	imap	143/tcp

then I rebooted the server.

My PINERC file has the line:

	inbox-path={indodt1}/usr/spool/mail/sinner

When I run PC-PINE I get:

	Can't connect to indodt1,143: Refused (10061)

then,

	No Inbox opened

Any help would be appreciated.  If I can get PC-PINE to interact with the 
SCO inboxes, I will make ALOT of users very happy.

On 8 Mar 1995 16:16:09 -0800, in comp.mail.pine, nashara@pepperdine.edu 
 (parading as Queen Bee) managed to electronically scribble:

% I also got the "can't open folder lock, access is read only" and then
% "folder is : open by another process" message.  I didn't have any
% problems getting the process id, but nothing happened when I typed "kill
% (number)" and I ended up waiting a week for the system to kill the
% process.  What happened?

Well, if you didn't immediately (or thereabouts) get a message saying
something to the effect of job killed, try 
kill -9 pid 
where pid is the process Id # of the process.

Christopher,

 o A patch has been posted a few times to deal with some initialization 
   problems in the global pine.conf file.  I don't know if that's the 
   problem you're seeing with the env. variable, but it would be worth 
   applying the patch anyway.  I've attached the patch again.  Please let
   us know if the problem persists.

 o In order to minimize unexpected surprises/side-effects of env vars,
   our goal is to allow env. variables to be used in the personal and 
   global pine config files, but to have them be referenced explicitly 
   rather than implicitly.  So 3.92 will not look at $MAIL implicitly.
   But what you are trying to do with $MAIL in the pine.conf is
   intended to work.

 o Re your last question: 3.92 will have the ability to "do both"

 o We don't know when 3.92 will be ready.

I was setting up a listserv on our system using the listproc version 
6.0c software, and I wanted to know which headers I have to preserve so 
that messages with attachments sent to lists will be seen by the 
recipients as messages with attachments instead of a lot of base64 garbage.

Pardon moi?

Can you explain this WWW option, are you saying Pine has Web browsing
capability??

And what about this telnet option, is this just shelling out and
then running telnet?

The last time Mark Crispin made such accusations, I asked for examples
and none came.  My guess is that if you disagree with Mark by posting
to comp.mail.pine, you are branded as sending abusive email.  (News vs
email confusion here.)  I would like to see either an example of
allegedly abusive email, or a retraction.

If Mark and others would stop attacking the established base of news
readers as being broken, and stop referring to UNIX users as 'weenies',
and making other equally incorrect or rude assertions, they would
cease to have any problem with abusive email (really Usenet postings
disagreeing with them).

Hmm...Sounds like Pine *is* assuming that the presence of a 
Newsgroups header in incoming email means that the user should be
asked if he wishes to post his email reply to Usenet.  Definitely
some assumption here.

True; 'context-free' is the key issue here.  Pine is not *required*
to lose the context, but does so because of some design decisions.

> It is the fact that some news readers sometimes chose to use a 
>non-standard usage and semantics for the "Newsgroups:" line...

I suspect we will forever go in circles about this.  In fact there are
very clear established meanings for the Newsgroups:  header.  In News,
it means something is being posted to the newsgroups mentioned in the
header.  In email it means this email is in response to such a
posting.  Until pine came into the picture nobody was confused about
these meanings.

Disagree;  the only reasonable action for any program is to
interpret the Newsgroups: header in the proper context.

Hello Mike -

I think that your test was fundamentally flawed, because you measured resident
memory instead of virtual memory.  The amount of resident memory is more an
artifact of how much the scheduler loves you than of any direct performance
measurement.

Bezerk/mbox format keeps every message in memory, in separate malloc() buffers
for each message.  In many implementations of malloc(), the size of a malloc()
buffer is a power of 2, thus you have to round up each message size to the
nearest power of two and sum that to get the total virtual memory consumed.
This is needed, because expunge and checkpoint operations require a copy of
the mailbox.  Many times, user's don't have the disk quota to do a disk copy,
and a disk copy is very slow anyway because the mailbox's inode needs to be
preserved (thus a disk copy would triple the amount of disk traffic!).

Tenex format uses a size count and reserved space for flags.  This permits
updates to be done in place (effectively, no checkpoints) and the source can
be used as a target for expunge (since you're guaranteed to be blatting data
down).

As a result, Tenex format does not keep message in memory.  It may read in a
single message for processing, but it'll never keep more than one in memory at
a time.

In general, Tenex format will be less memory hungry and faster than bezerk
format.  There is one exception; free text searches will be slower in tenex
format, since it actually has to read messages from the disk.  In bezerk
format, it'll do searches from memory, so that is faster.  Envelope/MIME
parses are potentially faster in bezerk format because of all the data being
in memory as well.  This is rarely much of an issue in actuality though.

If that is the cause, it isn't a general sendmail 8.6.10 problem - I just 
used pine to send to 35 addresses, and it worked fine...

Of course, it wasn't under AIX :-)

I am using Pine on Netcom.  I have discovered that when I get a

Is there any way around this restriction so that I have to send the

Hi, Mark -

That's what I had initially thought.  However I tried both Berkeley and 
Tenex tests 3 times each, and each time got *exactly* the same SZ (total 
virtual memory usage) and RSS (resident set size) for each type of 
instantiation.  As this seemed so constant I started wondering if the 
test might be valid.

Interestingly, if you run with what still may prove to be a flawed test 
for a while, the SZ value for Berkeley format was 782 pages (1 page = 
4Kb), and 820 pages for Tenex.  This is an even bigger difference than 
the 299 v 327 RSS values! :-}

This is very useful information too.  The implication is that the point I 
was measuring memory usage at is not the maximum, certainly for Berkeley 
(*WHY* can I never spell that right first time!!) format.  Hence apparent 
initial differences (if my test was valid, which I'm now doubting) are 
probably misleading for general use of the program.

On the whole I am being very tempted to go with the Tenex format for the 
INBOX.  I'm not overly worried about the free text searching, etc, which 
are used relatively infrequently.

I'm glad you said it is generally faster... I had thought there was a 
slight speed increase and wondered if I was hallucinating it.

Oil and water is actually an excellent analogy.  They're both liquids;
they can be measured and poured with the same tools.  But they are used
for different purposes, and if you mix them, if you lose track of which
is which, people will complain.

This is certainly not the case since I've publicly disagreed with
Mark and the Pine Team on a number of different occasions and I've
always received intelligent, well thought out responses.  On the
other hand I've received plenty of flame responses from people not on
the Pine Team.

You could postpone the message, suspend Pine, and edit the header of
postponed-mail.  It's a pain, but it works (at least it does in 3.87,
which my site's *still* using).

I used info given by you to succesfully installed Winsocks pcpine (I had=20
received the same error message before) with one exeption --- according=20
to comments in my inetd.conf it is necessary to use name of service from=20
/etc/services as the first word of inetd.conf line---seems to me you=20
used a name of the daemon. So for HP it works using:

imap stream tcp nowait root .........

Try imap instead of imapd. I hope it helps (and thank YOU for your help)

    Pine presently uses rsh for IMAP with no possibility to specify a
different username on the IMAP server (rsh -l user ...)
    I imagine it is on the List, as it is mentioned in the source code
comments.

    It is possible to add some code to the source to do this, and I have.
It works well, but not perfectly.

    The short answer is that no, you cannot save a remote IMAP login
username into your .pinerc, and that Pine does not support pre-specification
of a different IMAP login at this time.

  All you do is make a text file, like with dos edit or something, then 
upload it to your account, then rename it to .signature or .sig, 
depending on yoru setup.

  If you're using dos edit, you need to dos2unix the text file before you 
upload it.

  One of my problems, which i put to this newsgroup to answer, is this:  
When i include the message i'm replying to so i can edit and quote it, my 
signature always goes before the quoted message.  This is very annoying, 
as i have to then delete my sig since it looks silly at the start of the 
message.  how do i fix this?

Not Necessarily. It can/will mean this if the Emailed message is ONLY being
sent via Email (ie: It is a Reply-Via-Email). 

OTOH, if I am reading a News Article and create a Reply to be Posted and I
also [with the same upload] send this reply via Email (Cc is one way to do
this via a Header) then the Newsgroups header in the Emailed copy mean NOT
those that the message I am replying to was [cross-]posted but where the
Posted copy of this Email'ed Cc is being [cross-]posted. I am not even going
to get into the issue of Followup-To headers which also cause problems for
users who reply to Email'ed (or ML/NG Gatewayed) Messages/Articles <g>.

The real problem is that Pine who KNOWS how is is routing a message/article
when it creates it but REFUSES to correctly Document this information so
that when it sees an Incoming Message/Article it knows how set the default
reply method. 

How hard it is to add the Following types of documentation Headers

 "X-Also-Emailed to:" to the Posted Copy of an Emailed&Posted Article
 
 "X-Email-Replied-From:" (listing the Newsgroups that the Article being
Email Replyied to Appeared in) to the Email'ed Copy

 "X-Also-Posted-to:" (listing the Newsgroups that the Posted Version is
going to) to the Email'ed Copy of an Emailed&Posted Article

while leaving the Newsgroups for Backward Compatibility? Then when the user
is Viewing an Email'ed message copy with these headers, PINE can know if
this is an Email Reply or a Cc of a Posted Article and offer the Correct
Default Reply Addresses.

I suspect the problem is at netcom, since I dial in, use my computer as a

What should I tell them to change back the way it was before?

Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9503091816.G10977-0100000@poseidon.ifctr.mi.cnr.it>

After having spent some 15 min to press "down arrow - S - Alt-E - P" to 
sort some 300 mails I had of a correspondence of a project over the last 
three years into three separate folders one per year (the above sequence 
on my dxterm with Pine is "next message - Save - recall the edit menu - 
paste the folder name from the cut buffer") I wonder whether in a future 
version of Pine one could have features like :

  - possibility of selecting multiple messages and saving ALL of them
    into a folder (specifying the save operation and folder name just once)

  - having the "Save" command prompt you with a default folder name which
    is not "saved-messages" but the name of the LAST folder used (so one
    just presses return to save to it)

  - even better, given that I keep mail in folders arranged by project
    (topic) and not by pure chronological order (saved-mail-jan-93 ...),
    and usually by year (I rename the folder at Jan 1 manually), would
    it be possible to assign to folders a "maximum length" (number of
    messages) forcing one to rename the folder when this length is
    exceeded ?
    (VM Rice Mail had a feature like this for NOTEBOOKs) 

PS I am using 3.89, I do not plan to upgrade until 3.92 is out, but please
   do tell me if it will have some of the above features, thanks

The answer to that depends on which "religion" you belong to. If you
think that things are the same, then there cannot be any pain in
treating them the same, and your question is ridiculous. 

If you think there is a difference, then any move to force them to be
the same will be painful, and you will not see how there could possibly
be any pain in treating them differently. 

Now, there really is an answer to your question. It's not that
difficult. Here it is:

	They two models can coexist without pain IF those on
	both sides DO NOT ASSUME that their model is the only one.

That means that those who write the tools must accept that there are
those who think they differ, and they must write the tools to allow that
difference to be maintained.

The problem right now is that those writing the tools (Pine, e.g.) are
steadfast in their position that there is no difference. They have
written the tool to ignore any difference. This forces those who use the
tools into either accepting the "no difference" paradigm, or not using
the tool.

There is nothing stopping those who want to treat their mail and news as
the same thing even if the tools are able to, but when the tools cannot
differentiate those who want to treat them differently cannot.

There is only one header whose meaning would change. If the flag says
"mail", then "newsgroups" is undefined. It's that simple.

>Personally, I find (1) overly complex for implementors. 

If adding a header was overly complex, there wouldn't be the plethora of
X- and otherwise undefined headers there is today.

Semantics derive not only from the transport mechanics but also for the
organization/presentation of the material for the user.  There are
systems (databases of messages) that integrate lots of information from
all kinds of sources.  The designers of those databases and their
navigation tools aim to provide the best access possible for the users
of the messages.  That doesn't necessarily mean that netnews has to wear
a big ``netnews'' badge in those navigation tools, and that the
one-true-way to present it is to run an approved newsreader that
mediates all, and only, the news accesses.  Open your mind just a little
to allow for the possibility that the world is bigger than a few
programs that specialize in netnews, and that more ambitious tools still
do their darndest to play by the rules when it comes to the transport
issues.

There's no inherent reason to reflect the transport details to the user,
as long as the concepts that ARE reflected to the user can subsume the
transport details.

The current version of Pine, 3.91, has this.  You need to enable it in 
the Configuration screen by setting the "enable-aggregate-commands" option.

This then adds: a Select command (;) to select messages by various 
criteria (From, Subject, Date, etc); an Apply command (A) to apply 
commands such as Save to all the Selected messages; and Zoom (Z) to 
restrict the messages shown in the Folder Index to just the selected ones.

Again, in Pine 3.91's configuration screen there is an option to do just 
this.  Set "saved-msg-name-rule" to "last-folder-used".

Nope.  Not available in Pine.

Pine 3.90, and subsequently Pine 3.91, have been around for ages.  It 
really is worthwhile upgrading.  I don't believe anyone has seen a date 
mention for 3.92 other than "soon".  Don't cut off your nose to spite 
your face... "even" 3.91 is worth upgrading to! :-)

This nonsense merits correction. 

I sent Mr. Crispin one piece of email, which was a response to mail he
sent to me. 

What Mr. Crispin is really complaining about, and complained to my admin
about, was the comp.mail.headers gateway to the headers-people mailing
list.  While Mr. Crispin chose to send personal copies of every article
he sent to that mailing list to me by mail directly, I did not choose
to have the gateway send him anything. (In fact, had there been a way to
tell the gateway to limit what Mr. Crispin received,I would have used
it. There was no such option. Mr. Crispin signed on to the mailing list
for a penny, he signed on for a pound. On the other side, Mr. Crispin
refused to stop choosing to send me the mail he was.)

Now, just what is the "submission" I am trying to force upon people? 

One thing. Open your world view to accept that there are people who do
not view mail and news and the same thing, and who do not use mail and
news for the same thing, and write the tools to allow the distinction to
be made. That is, simply, accept that "same thing" is not the only
viewpoint. Nobody is saying that you must accept "different" as the only
way, just accept it as A way. A tool that allows users to differentiate
can be used in non-differentiating mode, but the obverse is not true.

The argument "people don't believe news and mail are different" just
won't fly -- there are people here telling you they believe they are
different. How you want to treat them is your business. Just understand
that some people DON'T believe they are the same.

Why don't you get the binary from uwash and install it in your own account?

    I'm seeing this on a US-ASCII-only terminal, but I think they're right.
They seem like the correct 7-bit equivalents to me for the 8-bit ISO 8859-1
characters, not a regional variant of ISO 646.  (I see f, x, and e.)
I'm also posting this with a newsreader which does not make use of MIME
headers or Q-P encoding, so I know several people will not see the correct
information.  Bear with me in spite of this, please.

    Pine does not at present decode this MIME header information, specified
in some RFC which escapes me -- been away from the qomputer too long.
Don't worry, this will be supported sometime, though I have no word as
to whether it will make it into 3.92.

    This is weird, that you can see them in exported mail, meaning you have
the correct font, but not within Pine -- usually you'll see things properly
with Pine so long as you have an appropriate font.
    Is there any other information you can give?  Like, perhaps, you use
Pine on an X terminal, in a separate window (and thus a different font) from
the window you view the exported mail?  Do you see a space where the special
characters should be, or are they just missing (Bjrn Ole Fredrikdegrd, for
example, in the From: header you quoted above)?  Give a bit more information
about the specifics of your setup to help track down what's failing, please.

Apologies if this is an old/standard question...

Is there a way in pine to edit a message before saving it to 
a folder?  I've been told that the only way to do it is to
forward to message back to yourself, whence you get an 
opportunity to edit the message (using pico or whatever).  Is
there way of using pico on incoming messages before saving
them?

Thanks!

In Pine 3.91 I am able to perform selected file operations:

First, you have to enable-aggregate-command-set in the Setup-Config screen.
Then:

Use the ; key to enter the Select menu.
You are prompted for a select criteria (All, By Text, By number, et cet).
If you select Text, you get a sub-select choice to further define your 
select criteria (ie. From, Subject, et cet).
The selection is now complete.  In order to do anything with these 
selected files, you must use the Apply command.
Choose Apply, and you will be given another menu of choices for the Apply 
cmmand.  Save is one of these, choose Save and specify the folder to Save 
to.  All selected files will be saved to that folder.  Done.

For Example:

In my network, the automated backups send notifications to me every night 
of their results.  I want to save these messages in my "bu" folder for 
prosperity.  I do this:

1)	;
2)	Text
3)	From
4)	root
5)	Apply
6)	Save
7)	bu
8)	Xpunge

My INBOX is cleared of all messages from root and my bu folder contains 
all of these messages.  12 or so keystrokes, not 36-40!

<nitpick mode on>

The meaning of the "References" header would change too.  This isn't
likely to matter in practice though (except when the stupid software
does choose to let the user post a follow-up to an email message, in
which case it must not treat the References header of that message as
RFC 1036 References).

Select the message and choose the "F"orward option.  Put nothing on the 
To: Cc: or Bcc: lines, and change the Fcc: line to be the folder you want 
to save to.  Then edit away and "send."  Note that this is only a 
workaround with the side effect that the message will be From you, not 
the original sender.

The point of news and mail is to help people communicate, not to save code
size, etcetera, etcetera. People use news and mail in completely different
ways. People say things in email they would never say in any broadcast
medium.

Mailing lists are sort of a hybrid, yes, and they mix the issues... but
mail to an individual needs to be dealt with separately from broadcast
mail, no matter whether that broadcast is via a mailing list or netnews.

User interfaces that hide where a message came from, or make assumptions
about where a message should go, are a bad idea.

Agreed. Since RFC822 doesn't define the meaning of "Newsgroups" any user
interface software expecting RFC822 should consider it commentary. Any
user interface importing netnews should convert it to RFC822 first.

This is technically correct, not so? You wouldn't expect to read in any
other type of non-RFC822 document without converting it.

If it does this conversion by converting "Newsgroups" to "Newsgroups" then
it needs to do something else with the non-RFC822 "Newsgroups" line it gets
in mail.

There is no proper meaning of the "Newsgroups" header in email. User interface
programs should neither put it in email, nor should they ascribe any meaning
to it if they receive it in email. Both Pnews and Pine are broken here. Both
should be fixed.

It's clear to me that both Pine and Trn, and other newsreaders that do this,
are at fault here. All should be fixed.

I am in the process of modifying Trn where I have it installed to send mail
with X-Newsgroups unless the mail was Cc-ed from a followup. The fix is very
easy... just change the definitions of MAILHEADER in common.h.

Anyone else interested in protecting their customers should do the same
thing. In addition, Pine should still be modified to either ignore or in
some similar way flag Newsgroups in incoming mail as something not to be
processed.

If we can come up with some common name for this header it would help. I've
used X-Newsgroups simply because it's a minimal change. Possibly something
more descriptive would be better. I'm open to suggestions.

Hi Mike -

I did a similar comparison test between two identical 89 message mailboxes,
differing only in format.  The tenex version is 616,679 bytes, the bezerk
version is 619968 bytes (the difference being in the internal data headers).

On a DECSYSTEM-5000 running Ultrix, the tenex version was 1772 SZ, 400 RSS;
whereas the bezerk version was 2608 SZ, 1260 RSS.

It is theoretically possible that the malloc() on SGI may be doing something
bizarre, such as free() being a no-op... ;-)

Hi,

I'm trying to run PC-Pine 3.91 (same with 3.90) on a PC with PC-NFS v5.0
(have also tried v4.0a), and am having problems opening the INBOX on the
unix host.

But it's strange: the first time I configure the pc-pine program, everything
works fine!  It will ask me for a inbox path & I type in:

{myhost}INBOX

and pc-pine goes on to open it and shows me my mail.  The NEXT time I try
to run pc-pine it complains about not finding that host!  (This time it has
read the inbox path from the file PINERC):

Host not found: myhost

So I deleted the PINERC file from the configuration file and started the
process again, but I get the same result!  Works the first time, but not
after that.

I've gone through the Pine news archives for the last three months, and have
noticed other people having the same problem, but no solutions.  Seems like if
there is a PC-NFS version of PC-PINE, someone must have got it working...please
share your solutions!  Thanks!

This goes just one tiny step too far.  Absence of a 'proper' meaning
has never been a good reason for omitting a header.  The best one can
say (if that) is that Pnews should have used X-Newsgroups rather than
Newsgroups -- and even that would be questionable as a rigid
assertion.

A News or email client can include any headers it wishes.  The News or
email client of the person reading the email or posting can ignore any
headers it wishes.  The problem occurs only if conflicting meanings get
established, and that is not the case here.

That last paragraph sounds like religion to me.  I'd say that people
who claim news and email are fundamentally different are locked into a
view of the world created by having separate UIs/message-stores, and
can't see the savings in code size, user training, software
development and GUI design that come from unifying the technologies.

The only difference that is currently causing problems is that the
"Newsgroups" header is ascribed different meanings in different
objects.  I consider this a relatively trivial difference, and one
that should be overcome.

Please use technical arguments rather than simple assertions.  I
dislike this solution because it requires decoding software to parse
the headers twice -- once to find the "type" and a second time to
process the headers.  This is a lot of extra complexity just for the
sake of retaining the current-practice context sensitive nature of the
"Newsgroups" header.  In addition, there would still be a need to
define a new header meaning "in addition to being sent as email, this
message was also posted to ...".

Please point me to an Internet document defining "Newsgroups" in that
way.

It would be fairly simple to define a new header like
"Discussion-From:" which would list newsgroups from which the
discussion originated.  Such a header would be useful in news (to
indicate migration of a conversation from other newsgroups) as well as
email.  As new newsreader software adopted this practice, users would
get more functionality and shared message-store technology would
become easier.

Not true.  You have argued that the Newsgroups header has two
different meanings based on the transport system.  How can I get the
RFC 1036 meaning of "Newsgroups" in an email message under your model?

This may be the best compromise solution between the two religions.  I
have a feeling we will never reach concensus on the proper meaning of
the "Newsgroups" header in email.

In my local News software, when something gets automatically reposted
(to a local newsgroup), the original Newsgroups header is transformed
to Orig-Newsgroups.  (Likewise with some other headers.)

I like Orig-Newsgroups.  It tells the reader that something was in a
certain newsgroup before but might be elsewhere now.  It could also be
used when a follow-up is posted to a different set of newsgroups, to
let the reader know where the original posting was to which the
follow-up is being done.

>...unless the mail was Cc-ed from a followup....

Never, I hope.  Posting a follow-up and also sending an identical copy
in email confuses the recipient into believing he or she is getting a
private message.

I've had this exact problem and posted a tips message on solving it. You may
not have found it because I refered to it as Unknown Host rather than Host 
not found. Sorry. Anyway see below for my solution and let me know if you 
still have problems.

Subject: Tips: Windows PC-Pine hangs, and Unknown Host

Thought I'd pass on a couple solution that I encountered while installing
PC-Pine under windows and with PCNFS:

Running under DOS with PCNFS: 
Problem: Unknown Host

I have managed to get PC-Pine for PCNFS to run under DOS, it was unable
to locate the remote host but I freed up some main memory - it now has 
5603k and it works fine (thanks to Clinton Bittel). 


Running under Windows with winsock.dll:
Problem: Hangs opening INBOX

Unfortunately, the Windows winsock version will not run. It hangs while
trying to open INBOX.

I upgraded the winsock.dll to Dec. 25, 1993  24576B and it no longer hangs.

You may want to try a more recent version, but I've got to worry about
whether it will work with my sqllink drivers.

The 'bus error' in Pine that happens when you have more than 25
addresses in a 'To:', 'Cc:', or 'Bcc:' field is due to a bug in
sendmail.  We recently upgraded sendmail from version 8.6.9 to version
8.6.10, and this bug only occurs in the later version.  Our system
administrators are looking into the problem, and hope to resolve it
soon.  Until then, and in general if you want to send email to more
than 25 addresses at once, we recommend using the 'massmail' program.
You can find out more about this program from the manual pages.  Type:

man massmail

at the netcom prompt.  

If you continue to have problems or questions, please email us or call
us at (408) 983-5970 (open 24 hrs./day).

Two simple rebuttals:

1. When standard practice conflicts with an RFC, the RFC is wrong.
  (Trust me on this one.)

2. The standard practice in question does not in fact violate RFC 1036,
   because it is outside the scope of this RFC.

I fairly often send BRIEF messages to a fairly large mailing group (about
20 people).  Right now I send them using 4 separate lists to keep the
header from vastly exceeding the message.  Is there any means by which I
could send to the whole group at once, but repressing addresses (in other
words, the way a mailing list is sent -- "multiple recipients of" format)? 

I assume the answer involves some use of BCC: but am not sure how to make 
it work.

Thanks in advance!

But the existence of integrated databases and software cannot possibly
imply that I am wrong when I admonish software authors:

     Don't discard useful information.

Whether something is News or email is useful information.  This
information is definitely available until software at some point
chooses to disacard it.  No database, however, integrated it might be,
should discard this information.

Hey, mrcoolhacker, can the art and control chars in your sig.  Notice they
get eaten by the news transport anyway, so they are just irritating.  Your

That is absurd.  RFC1036 defines the format of usenet messages.  It

Your interpretation makes no sense.  Again, keep in mind that RFC1036
is defining usenet formats.  It is not defining email formats.

The lines you marked were not intended as a specification.  They were
a statement of design philosophy.  The usenet standard was based on
the assumption that software tools designed for email could process
usenet messages.

If this was a specification, then it was specifying what is allowed
in usenet.

>I also note that this states that USENET is a set of _extensions_ to

RFC1036 indicates that it is stricter than RFC822.  How can it be
an extension if it is a restriction?

>RFC-822.  Does it make sense to have two different extensions to

RFC822 deals mainly with syntax.  The argument of pine's use of
"Newsgroups:" is about semantics rather than about syntax.

My email agent uses the following semantics for "To:"

	If the message is being composed, it is to be sent to
	the addresses on the "To:" header.

	If the message is being read, the contents of the "To:"
	header is informational.

That is, a single mail agent can already deal with apparently
conflicting semantics for "To:".  Similarly, pine should be able to
use alternative semantics for "Newsgroups:".

The philosophy seems to be:

  It is too difficult to change pine to be consistent with all of the
  other software and all of the human users.  Therefore we should
  keep pine the way it is, and change all of the other software and
  the humans who use that other software.  The tail is trying to wag
  the dog.

Hallo,

I'm a newbie in pine and I've a problem with the editor.
I will utilize the alternate-editor option. How can I do this ?

in hp-ux:

- setenv EDITOR /usr/bin/vi
- in pine-setup-menue        set enable-alternate-editor-cmd
			     set enable-alternate-editor-implicitly
			     editor = /usr/local/bin/pico

What is false ??? The change in pine from pico to alternate editor vi
isn't o.K. (Unknown Command: ^_)

Thank you and sorry for my bad english

Kathrin

The problem started on March 3. I have e-mailed netcom repeatedly but 
they just ignore me. I called them and was told they are weeks behind in 
reading e-mail from subscribers. Pine on netcom creates this error with 
anything more than 24 addresses. It was not like this until March 3. 
Please e-mail netcom over and over until they respond to this problem.

Apologies if this an old/standard question...

Is it possible to edit a message in pine, *before* saving it
to a folder?  I've been told that the only way to do this
is to forward the message to yourself whence you get an
opportunity to edit the message using pico (or whatever).  
Is it possible to use pico on incoming mail before saving
it to a folder?

Thanks!

Apologies if this is a familiar question but...

I would like to be able to edit incoming mail messages before
saving them to a particular folder but I have been unable to
work out how to do this in pine.  Is there any way to do this?

Thank you!

Yes,  you can forward your mail by leaving a ".forward" file which contains 
your forwarded address. For example, my alternate account has a .forward 
file in my home directory. File has only one line 
     "mkamal@site.gmu.edu" (without qoutes) 
and I pick up all of my mail from site.gmu.edu account.

Well - at my site, it's not Pine that is discarding any information,
but trn that is responsible. It saves messages locally to what looks
like a MAIL-box. Perhaps some other gateway software is loosing other
information, but I've never seen Pine throw away or ignore any 
usefule information. And in fact, most of your complaints have been
about the fact that Pine attempts to *alert* the user about information
which *could* indicate that a message *may* have been sent both by mail
and also posted to a newsgroup. This is very useful information to 
know. ( Other people have complained that when someone CC's them a
copy of a publicly posted message as a courtesy, that they find it 
anoying to not know that information - and sometimes send a private
reply before the discover that is the fact. ) 
 The lack of any standards for indicating this, however, makes it
an uncertain determination - which is why pine asks you (twice)
for confirmation, if you decide to reply with a public posting.

Is there a way to set the username to something other than the default on

I really think you must write: <No value set: using ".sig">
If you have .sig in a different directory, then try it adding a path.
 
Excuse me if you don't understand me.

Subject: Please help - pine for VMS
X-Vms-To: SMTP%"pine-info@cac.washington.edu"

I've been trying to install the VMS version of PINE on an alpha for some
time now. The problem I am having involves creating folders. When
I try to send mail, I get a message that says:
	Folder "mymail" doesn't exist. Create? Y
	[Can't create mailbox SYSmymail: mailbox already exists]

When trying to create a folder named TMP, I get a message that says: 
	Can't create mailbox SYStmp: mailbox already exists

even though there is no such mailbox. I believe the problem has to do with
the assignment of the "folder-collection" variable. I've tried the suggestion 
of the README file that came with PINE, and tried reading the text at the 
HTTP site. All to no avail. If anyone who has had success with the installation
of PINE for vms could tell me how they specified the folder-collection path,
it would be greatly appreciated.

Message-Id: <3jrart$kmf@canopus.cc.umanitoba.ca>

I would like to be able to send a mail 'package' to another person 
consisting of an attached file. No problem if I where to start Pine and 
simply create an email and attach a file.  However, I would like to be 
able to do this from a command line, similar in nature to the elm command 

elm -s subject address <filename

The problem with elm (I think) is that is can only transfer files this 
way by encoding them within the body of the message.  I would prefer that 
the file attachment be external (binary) thus allowing the receiving 
person to also use Pine to receive without having to bother with un 
encoding it.  Can Pine do this???  If so how???  If there is an FAQ that 
would help me in this regard please point me in that direction.  Thank you

Jim

Look at your incoming-folder collection via the Setup/Config screen and 
see if there is an entry that needs deleting.

I am using PINE on Netcom.  I have discovered that when I get a 
distribution list of over about 50 names, I get a shell bus error from 
Netcom.  I have had to break the list into two pieces and send the 
message two individual times.

Is there any way around this restriction so that I have to send the 
message only once?

Please send any guidance by E-mail to the above.

messages will appear again.

	Recently, my host has upgraded the PINE mail system to version 
3.91, which includes the ability to view, and post to, the USENET 
groups.  It is a great system, but if I previously ran across an 
interesting post that I'd like to reply to after reading it with the RTIN 
newsreader, when I enter PINE to find the article, it's gone...and I 
don't know how to view previously read articles so I could reply to them.

	Could someone please help me find the commands, or proper 
program SETUP in PINE, to all the viewing of all articles -- whether 
previously read or not??   Thanks very much, in advance.

My config screen doesn't show an incoming folder collection.  And I still 
can't delete the name of the nonexistent folder, whether the incoming 
folders option is enabled or disabled.

Hello.  Is it possible to have pine automatically default to saving
news messages into a folder which somewhat resembles the name of the
newsgroup?

Thank you in advance.

I assume this is the version from Israel?
but I believe the answer is still true.
In VMS MAIL you can not have empty folders, so there is no way you can 
just "create" a folder.

The only way to "create" a folder is to put a message in there.
There are several ways to do this, one is to copy/save a message there, 
another is to use an external utility which puts a dummy message in a 
folder and thus creating it. The second is what will be in PMDF's Pine 
3.91 implementation when you choose the "create folder" command.
The external utility works in the current PMDF's Pine 3.89 when you use 
fcc. (the external utility is part of PMDF and is not generally available)

Most Mac telecomm software allows users of older Macs to remap some 
other key (usually the Command or Option key) to act as the Control key.  
Pine will interpret a double-Escape as Control, but unfortunately the 
older Mac keyboards dont have Escape keys either...

The 'bus error' in Pine that happens when you have more than 25
addresses in a 'To:', 'Cc:', or 'Bcc:' field is due to a bug in
sendmail.  We recently upgraded sendmail from version 8.6.9 to version
8.6.10, and this bug only occurs in the later version.  Our system
administrators are looking into the problem, and hope to resolve it
soon.  Until then, and in general if you want to send email to more
than 25 addresses at once, we recommend using the 'massmail' program.
You can find out more about this program from the manual pages.  Type:

man massmail

at the netcom prompt.  

If you continue to have problems or questions, please email us or call
us at (408) 983-5970 (open 24 hrs./day).

I agree that you get bizarre results if folder-collections is not
defined correctly, but once I had set it to the value laid down in
the README (i.e folder-collections=SYS/[] ) it worked fine on VAX/VMS.
 
I will check with my contact who's using it on DEC ALPHA on Monday
and let u know if he found anything different.
 
You have definitely got a MAIL.MAI file, haven't you?  People who
never used VMS MAIL before will not have this mail database.
He told me that he had to turn his VMS MAIL forwarding off and send
himself a mail to create his MAIL.MAI before his first success
with VMS PINE.
 
I'm sure you'll get it sorted...it works for us.
 
Perhaps you'd email your .PINERC (and PINE.CONF, if used) files
to me and I'll tell you if I see anything wrong.

Giving users a unified model of news, mail, etc. and saving them the
need to train to use N different client interfaces helps them
communicate.  

I certainly don't use news and mail in completely different ways.  I
say the same sorts of things in email mailing lists and netnews
newsgroups.  

I use the same client to both read and send to personal email, mailing
lists, netnews, and local bboards.  In this system, unmoderated news
(anybody posts, nobody writes, everybody reads) and "personal" mail
(anybody posts, only I write, only I read) are but two extremes of a
wide range of possible access control restrictions that can be placed
on any given hierarchically named collection of messages.

Mailing lists are a counterexample to your claim that people use news
and mail in completely different ways.  Mailing list addresses are
indistinguishable from "personal" email addresses.  How is a UA
supposed to deal with the two separately?

There are people working on extensions to NNTP to support
authentication, permitting access control on netnews newsgroups.
A netnews group access-restricted to five users is not a "broadcast
medium" in the sense you use.  Any user intending to post to such a
group and finding their message on a big-7 group is going to be just
as upset as these Pine users with misdirected replies.

By this argument, using the contents of the From, Reply-To, To, CC,
Newsgroups, or Followup-To headers when deciding where a responding
message should go is a bad idea.

Since RFC822 doesn't define the meaning of "Content-Type", any user
interface software expecting RFC822 should consider it commentary.

RFC 1036 messages conform to RFC822, modulo a nit concerning
destination headers.

Certainly all should be "fixed", in the name of pragmatism if nothing
else.  Neither just fixing Pine nor just fixing Trn is going to fix
the problem in both the short and long term.

In-Reply-To is one posssibility, that header allows random junk.

If you ask the user, then you are assuming it has some meaning. Since it
has none in mail, Pine is making an incorrect assumption. Does Pine ask
the user what to do about every undefined header it finds?

There is no standard context-free meaning to anything. This fact does
not make it impossible for assumptions to be made.

No, there is another reasonable action: keep track of the source of the
message. If the message is mail, then remember that. If the message is
news, remember that. Whether that "remembering" comes in the form of a
Pine-specific X-header, or some other method, is irrelevant. Pine can
know "I got this message out of the user's inbox -- it's mail. I'll put
a tag on it so I can remember that, even if I put it in a folder
somewhere and look at it later." Or, "I had to ask NNTP for this
message, it's news."

The only thing stopping that "memory" being implemented is that the
people who write the code for Pine don't want to accept that some people
view mail and news as different tools. 

>ask the user to decide, based perhaps on other clues in the message text.

The user shouldn't be forced to guess at information that Pine had and
threw away, based on "clues" that usually aren't there. 

(Quick, just based on the body of this article, did I mail it to you or
did I post it? Mark Crispin couldn't tell the difference. How will you?)

It's actually doing the right thing:  converting the Usenet postings
into email format, so they may be later treated as email.  Once a
Usenet posting has been moved into your private collection, it should
be treated as email.  Post no follow-ups to it.  Usenet is a game
played in context.  Please see another posting from me expanding on
this idea.

This is truly the problem:  Taking an email message and creating doubt
in the reader's mind that it might be a Usenet posting.

It absolutely does not matter if the same email message might also have
been posted to Usenet by its author.  If what one has in one's mailbox
is what arrived by email, treat it as email.  If one wishes to post a
follow-up, one posts a follow-up to the specific copy that's in the
News spool area.  Please see more about this in the aforementioned
separate posting.

Agreed with everything else you said, and the above too, but I will add this:

     Once a Usenet posting has been transferred to the user's private
     area, treat it as email.  Post no follow-ups to it.

And to add more context, here is a saved posting.

This is a *very* elegant statement.

After some thinking, I have come to realize that

     - Newsgroups: header in email
     - Offer to post a reply to Usenet
     - News == email or News != email

are all side issues.  The real issue is this:

     Usenet followups should be sent only when reading Usenet news
     "live", i.e., when a freshly-obtained posting (which you "get")
     is being viewed.  After you have "gotten" it and saved it, it
     becomes akin to email and no more Usenet followups should
     be derived from it.

I'm reminded of a number of sports in which the ball is "alive" (in
play) from a certain moment to a certain moment, and one may score
points during that time.  After some amount of play, the ball is "dead"
and no more points may be scored until it becomes alive again.

Well, Usenet is like that.  One does not followup to a "dead" Usenet
posting, one that has been plucked from the Usenet context and put into
one's personal folder.  Usenet is a game played in context.  One
follows up only to a "live" posting, one that has not yet become
"dead".  Nothing arriving by email is a Usenet posting (though it might
be a "dead", i.e., saved, copy.)  Nothing in one's personal files is a
Usenet posting (thought it might be a "dead", i.e., saved copy).

Pine wants to score points after the ball is dead.

That's an unfortunate point of view that would preclude offline readers
from posting followups.

So long as offline reading of News is equivalent to a type of caching,
it will have no adverse effect on the result.  As soon as ofline
reading of News becomes a synonym for treating everything as email,
either no followups are permitted or we have very confused users.

Wrong.  Mailing lists are a counterexample to the claim that "all people

There's no need to deal with the two separately.  You shouldn't post
messages you got on a mailing list either.

I don't want to add to this already long and boring thread. But,
after all these post about how broken Pine is, I feel the need to tell
the development team that I like what Pine does. Please, do not change
it in a restrictive direction. It is *MY* business how I will treat
news and email, or saved news messages. I hate the idea that a computer
program decides what I do. The program is only a tool. It should give
me as many options as possible and *I* will decide what I will do.
Pine just does that now, and I am happy with that.

Keep up the good work,
Selcuk

It may be standard practice, but it violates RFC 1036:

<    all USENET news messages must be formatted as valid Internet mail
<    messages, according to the Internet standard RFC-822.  The USENET
<    News standard is more restrictive than the Internet standard,

<*   message.  In any situation where this standard conflicts with the
<    Internet standard, RFC-822 should be considered correct and this
<    standard in error.

The use of the "Newsgroups" header for different purposes in mail and
news effectively violates the sentence I've marked with "*".  In
addition, it clearly violates the spirit of this paragraph.

I also note that this states that USENET is a set of _extensions_ to
RFC-822.  Does it make sense to have two different extensions to
RFC-822 which use the same header for different purposes, particularly
if one of those extensions isn't even published?

Hi,

Have I missed something obvious, or isn't it possible to save into your 
.pinerc what usercode you want to use for IMAP (or rsh IMAP for that matter)?

That's one of the purposes of MIME's quoted-printable,
to exchange documents between consenting 8-bit platforms in
a way that will not be harmed by 7-bit data paths.
 
It stands to reason that if your platform does not support
the character glyphs in question, then you cannot display
them, directly.  But it is not completely clear from what the
poster wrote that their terminal or terminal emulation is
fundamentally incapable of displaying these characters: maybe
they have simply failed to set it up correctly (as happens if
I set my terminal emulator up for UK-ASCII and tell PINE
wrongly that it is set for US-ASCII).
 
Check the manual for your terminal (or terminal emulation
software) to find out how to put it into ISO8859-1 mode.
it's no use configuring PINE to use ISO8859-1 unless the
terminal does the correct thing when receiving this code.
 
In general, if you and your correspondent both have
proper compliant platforms, you have every right to want to
interchange mail using all your available characters, and PINE
(with MIME encoding) is an excellent way to do that,
 
Don't expect it to work on usenet, though.  MIME compliance
is a rarity, so far, in news reader software.
 
As for the poster's comments about national characters
being included in email addresses.  What is legal in
email addresses is laid down by RFC822.  I don't suppose you
are allowed to have national characters as elements in email
addresses.  This part of the mail interchange is not included
in the MIME encoding.

PINE with MIME do this perfectly fine.  PINE switches into
quoted-printable, declares in the header that it's using
ISO8859-1, and represents our pound-sterling sign as =A3.
 
LB is definitely wrong, by the way - that's for pounds
weight, not Pounds Sterling, which is best abbreviated as
GBP (GB being the ISO code for United Kingdom), although
UKL is also understood by those with a little classical education.
However, I digress.
 
At the receiving end if the platform is compliant it displays
the pound sterling.  If it does not support MIME it displays
=A3 (the hexadecimal escape code for the ISO8859-1 code point).
If it supports MIME but does not support ISO8859-1 (for
example, it only supports US-ASCII), PINE displays a warning.
 
Your advice about avoiding national characters is still valid
for many situations.  Comp.mail.pine is one of the few places
where this advice can be deprecated...    ;-)

Take that to its logical conclusion:  Pine should always ask whether you
want to post a followup article whether the original discussion took place
in mail or news.

You will not get much support for that idea.

You need to do this because the files you are retrieving
with ^R contain long lines. They have likely been created
in a word processor, which when saving as ascii or DOS text
has not put a carriage return at the end of each screen line,

Actually, I make sure all my text is less that the 79 or 80 
characters I can display on screen. If I prepare a document 
with a word processor, I save it as ascii, then finish
formatting it in a text editor (memacs) in a width like you
see here. It is also easier to read on-screen.

I make sure all files in my /home directory are formatted 
properly when I place them there. When they are retreived 
with ^R, they fit in perfectly, with no reformatting (^J)
needed.

Subject: 0.0 About this Article

Q: How can I have my incoming mail messages automatically put into an 
   appropriate folder?

This is one of the most frequently asked questions about email.  This article 
is the first release of an FAQ that addresses this question.  This version 
gives basic instructions for how to set up either procmail or Elm's filter 
to filter incoming mailing list messages.  Future versions of this FAQ will 
include instructions for doing other things like automatically replying to 
certain messages.

If your system has both procmail and filter installed then you should use 
procmail which is *much* more robust and powerful than filter.  This 
recommendation is almost universal; even the Elm and filter developers
recommend procmail over filter.

Subject: ... 0.6 Reading the Plain Text Version of This Article

If you are reading the plain text version (i.e., not the hypertext version) of 
this FAQ it is in RFC1153 digest format which means each subject is formatted 
as a mini mail message with its own Date, From, and Subject (and sometimes 
 Followup-To) headers.  Some newsreaders and mailers make it really easy
to jump to a subject in an article that is in digest format.  Here are 
instruction for some newsreaders:

* NN's default is to split a digest and present each digest item on the 
  menu.  If you have changed the default by putting ``set split off'' in 
  your ~/.nn/init file then you can split an article that is in digest 
  format by typing G% while viewing it.  This will present each digest item 
  on a submenu.  You can then read, followup-to, save, print, etc. individual 
  digest items.

* In trn (and its relatives like rn and strn) you can type ^g (Ctrl key 
  and g key pressed together) to skip to the next line that begins with
  "Subject: "

* In emacs GNUS, C-c C-n will skip to the next digest article (C-C C-p will
  go back to the previous digest article).


If your newsreader or mailer does not have a built-in command that allows
you to easily read a digest you can pipe the article to ``formail -ds''
which will split the article into separate mail messages, and then you can
use your mailer or newsreader (if it can read mail folders) to read the
folder.  For example, here's what you would do in Tin while viewing
the article:

Type...                           In order to...
-------                           --------------
|                                 Pipe
a                                 Specify the article is to be piped
formail -ds >> ~/mail/faq.split   Split the digest into individual
                                  messages and put them in a file named
                                  ~/mail/faq.split.  (Replace ~/mail
                                  with your folder directory.)
pine -if faq.split                Use Pine to read the newly created folder.

For more information see the formail(1) man pages.

Subject: 1.0 Naming Your Incoming Mail Folders

For my incoming mail folders I use names that start with ``IN''.
For example, I put mail sent to the procmail mailing list into a
folder named IN.procmail.  I do this so that when all my folders
are listed alphabetically the incoming folders are together and
near the top.  They are near the top because Unix is case sensitive
and upper case letters come before lower case letters in an ascii
sort.

Of course, you can use any names you like for your mail folders.

Subject: 2.0 Procmail

Procmail is a powerful mail processor that can be used to process your
mail messages either as they arrive or after they are in a mail folder.  
This version of the FAQ describes the basics of setting up procmail to
filter incoming mailing list messages.

To find out how to process existing mail folders see the NOTES section
of the procmail(1) man page.

------------------------------

Date: 17 Nov 1994 23:02:10 GMT
From: Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: ... 2.1 Setting Up Procmail

1] Find out if procmail is on your system and what the full path to it is.  
   If you are using csh type:

     which procmail

   Or if you are using sh or ksh type:

     type procmail

   If neither ``which'' nor ``type'' are on your system try ``whereis'' and
   ``where''.  If your system doesn't have procmail ask your system 
   administrator to install it.  If your sys admin isn't able to do this,
   use a different mail processor like deliver, mailagent, or filter 
   (described in part 2 of this FAQ).


2a] Create ~/.procmailrc.  (Note that throughout this article I use
    pico for editing files.  Replace ``pico'' with your editor.)

     cd
     pico .procmailrc

  
2b] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.procmailrc.
    Note that lines that begin with # are comments and are ignored by
    procmail.

     #Set on when debugging
     VERBOSE=off
 
     #Replace ``mail'' with your mail directory (Pine uses mail, Elm uses Mail)
     MAILDIR=$HOME/mail
     
     #Directory for storing procmail log and rc files
     PMDIR=$HOME/.procmail
     
     LOGFILE=$PMDIR/log
     INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/rc.test
     INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/rc.folders

3] Create the directory where you will store your procmail log and rc files 
   (this is $PMDIR that you set above).

     cd
     mkdir .procmail


4a] Create an rc (run commands) file for testing:

     cd
     cd .procmail
     pico rc.test


4b] Enter the following in ~/.procmail/rc.test:

      :0:
      * ^Subject: .*test
      IN.testing

    Note that the first line contains a zero (0), not the letter "oh".
    For now, don't worry about the meaning of this recipe.  It is
    explained in the subject "Explanation of Test Recipe" below.


5a] Create a ~/.forward file by typing the following. (Pico's -w flag tells 
    pico not to auto wrap lines.)

     cd
     pico -w .forward



5b] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.forward:


     "|IFS=' ' && exec /usr/local/bin/procmail -f- || exit 75 #nancym"


    == IMPORTANT NOTES ==
    * Make sure you include all the quotes, both double (") and single (').
    * The vertical bar (|) is a pipe.
    * Replace /usr/local/bin with the correct path for procmail (see step 1).
    * Replace ``nancym'' with your userid.  You need to put your userid in 
      your .forward so that it will be different than any other .forward file 
      on your system.
   
    * Do NOT use environment variables, like $HOME, in your .forward file.
    * Do NOT expect ~ to mean your home directory in the .forward file: If 
      procmail resides below your home directory write out the *full* path.


5c] Note that on many systems you need to make your .forward world 
    readable and your home directory world searchable in order for the
    mail transport agent to "see" it.  To do this type:
   
      cd
      chmod 644 .forward
      chmod a+x .


6] Send yourself two test messages: one with ``test'' in the subject
   and one without ``test'' in the subject.


7a] Start your mailer (pine, elm, etc.) and check that the messages
    were delivered correctly.  The one with ``test'' in the subject
    should be in the folder $MAILDIR/IN.testing and the one without 
    ``test'' in the subject should be in your inbox.  If these were
    delivered correctly go on to step 8.


7b] TROUBLESHOOTING
    * If the two messages were not delivered correctly look at your
      $LOGFILE (~/.procmail/log) to see if you can determine what
      the problem is.  

    * Check these three files for typos:
        ~/.forward
        ~/.procmailrc
        ~/.procmail/rc.test

    * Check the file and directory permissions of your .forward (set in 
      5c above).

      Type...          In order to...
      -------          --------------
      cd               Go to your home directory.
      
      ls -l .forward   Check the permission: it should say -rw-r--r--
      
      ls -ld .         Check permission of home dir: it should say drwx?-x?-x
                       The ?'s may be r's or hyphens or one of each (i.e.,
                       drwx--x--x, drwxr-xr-x, drwxr-x--x, drwx--xr-x).
      

    * If none of these turn up the problem edit your ~/.procmailrc so
      that it contains:

        VERBOSE=on

      And repeat steps 6 and 7.  If you are still having problems see the 
      subject "Troubleshooting: Alternate .forward Files for Procmail" below.

   
8a] Once you have successfully tested procmail in steps 6 and 7, create 
     rc.folders for filtering incoming messages into mail folders.
  
      cd
      cd .procmail
      pico rc.folders


8b] Enter a modified version of the following in ~/.procmail/rc.folders

     :0:
     * ^TOwww-talk
     IN.www-talk

     :0:
     * ^TOprocmail
     IN.procmail
     
     The first recipe filters the www-talk mailing list and the second recipe
     filters the procmail mailing lists  The meaning of the first recipe is 
     as follows:

     Notation      Meaning
     ========      =======
     :0            Begin a recipe
       :           Use a lock file
     *             Begin a condition 
       ^TO         Match ``To:'' ``Cc:'' or other synonyms for To at the
                   beginning of a line, followed by any or no characters,
                   followed by....
          www-talk  ``www-talk''
     IN.www-talk   If successful match, put in folder $MAILDIR/IN.www-talk

  
     Create a recipe for each of your mailing lists.  Make sure that you
     use ``^TO'' with no space between the caret (^) and the word ``TO'', 
     and that both letters are capitalized -- if you don't it won't work.

     Note that ^TO is not a normal regular expression.  It is a special
     procmail expression that is designed to catch any destination 
     specification.  See the MISCELLANEOUS section of the procmailrc(5)
     man page for details.  For examples, see procmailex(5) man page.
     

9]  Repeat steps 6 and 7 to make sure that things are still working.


10]  Comment out the rc.test line in you .procmailrc file so that it looks 
     like this:
          
       VERBOSE=off
       MAILDIR=$HOME/mail
       PMDIR=$HOME/.procmail
       LOGFILE=$PMDIR/log
       # INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/rc.test
       INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/rc.folders

     Note that it's useful to leave the rc.test line there for future testing.

Subject: ... 2.2 Tracking Your Incoming Mail

There is a useful script, which is part of the procmail package, for 
checking your procmail log file called mailstat.  Check to see if it is 
on your system by typing either ``which mailstat'' or ``type mailstat''.  
If it's on your system type:

  mailstat $HOME/.procmail/log

This displays a concise version of your log file and moves your log 
file to log.old.  You may want to put the above line in your .login so that 
each time you log in you will see a listing of how many messages you've
received since the last time you ran mailstat, and what folders these
messages were delivered to.

You can get a mailstat listing of log.old by using the -o flag:

  mailstat -o $HOME/.procmail/log


If mailstat is not on your system ask your system administrator to
install it.  It is located with all the other procmail tools at:

ftp://ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/pub/packages/procmail/procmail.tar.gz

Subject: ... 2.4 Troubleshooting: Alternate .forward Files for Procmail

If the .forward template in 5b above doesn't work the following alternatives 
might be helpful:

In a perfect world:
	"|exec /usr/local/bin/procmail #nancym"
In an almost perfect world:
	"|exec /usr/local/bin/procmail USER=nancym"
In another world:
	"|IFS=' ';exec /usr/local/bin/procmail #nancym"
In a different world:
	"|IFS=' ';exec /usr/local/bin/procmail USER=nancym"
In a smrsh world:
	"|/usr/local/bin/procmail #nancym"

These formats can be tried in different combinations, the leading "| can
be tried as |" instead, or vice versa.

Some systems do not need a .forward file (i.e., having a .procmailrc file 
suffices if procmail already is the local delivery agent).

Subject: 3.0 Filter

Filter is part of the Elm package of tools.  Note that you can use filter
to filter your incoming mail even if you are not using Elm to read your mail.

IMPORTANT NOTE
==============
If your system has both procmail and filter installed then you should use 
procmail which is *much* more robust and powerful than filter.  This 
recommendation is almost universal; even the developers of Elm and Filter
recommend procmail over filter.  IT IS POSSIBLE TO LOSE MAIL MESSAGES
WHEN USING FILTER; this is rare but it has happened.

Subject: ... 3.1 Setting up Filter
Followup-To: comp.mail.elm

1] Find out if filter is on your system and what the full path to it is.  
   If you are using the C shell (csh) type:

     which filter

   Or, if you are using the Korn shell (ksh) or the Bourne shell (sh) type:

     type filter

   If neither ``which'' nor ``type'' are on your system try ``where'' and
   ``whereis''.  If your system doesn't have filter ask your system 
   administrator to install it; or even better ask her to install procmail.


2] Note the full path of your home directory by typing:

     cd
     pwd


3a] Create ~/.elm/filter-rules.  (Note that throughout this article I use
    pico for editing files.  Replace ``pico'' with your editor.)

     cd
     mkdir .elm
     cd .elm
     pico filter-rules

  
3b] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.elm/filter-rules

     if (subject contains "test") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.testing"
   
   Replace /j/nancym with your home directory path (see step 2).
   Replace /Mail with the name of the directory where your mail folders are
   stored.  Pine and Berkeley Mail use /mail (lower case m) and Elm uses 
   /Mail (upper case M).
   

4] To see what the filter rule will do type the following at your Unix 
   prompt:  

     filter -r


5a] Create a ~/.forward file by typing the following. (Pico's -w flag tells 
    pico not to auto wrap lines.)

      cd
      pico -w .forward


5b] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.forward:


     "|/usr/local/bin/filter -o /j/nancym/.elm/filter-errors"


    == IMPORTANT NOTES ==
    * Make sure you include the quotes (").
    * The vertical bar (|) is a pipe.
    * Replace /usr/local/bin with the correct path for filter (see step 1).
    * Replace /j/nancym with your home directory (see step 2).
   
    * Do NOT expect environment variables, like $HOME, to work in your 
      .forward file.
    * Do NOT expect ~ to mean your home directory in the .forward file.


5c] Note that on many systems you need to make your .forward is world 
    readable and your home directory world searchable in order for the
    mail transport agent to "see" it.  To do this type:
   
      cd
      chmod 644 .forward
      chmod a+x .


6] Send yourself two test messages: one with ``test'' in the subject
   and one without ``test'' in the subject.


7a] Start your mailer (pine, elm, etc.) and check that the messages
    were delivered correctly.  The one with ``test'' in the subject
    should be in the folder IN.testing and the one without ``test'' 
    in the subject should be in your inbox.  If these were delivered 
    correctly go on to step 8.


7b] TROUBLESHOOTING
    * If the two messages were not delivered correctly look at your
      ~/.elm/filter-errors to see if you can determine what the problem 
      is.  

    * Check these two files for typos:
        ~/.forward
        ~/.elm/filter-rules

    * Check the file and directory permissions of your .forward (set in 
      5c above).

      Type...          In order to...
      -------          --------------
      cd               Go to your home directory.
      
      ls -l .forward   Check the permission: it should say -rw-r--r--
      
      ls -ld .         Check permission of home dir: it should say drwx?-x?-x
                       The ?'s may be r's or hyphens or one of each (i.e.,
                       drwx--x--x, drwxr-xr-x, drwxr-x--x, drwx--xr-x).
      

    * If none of these turn up the problem edit your ~/.forward so
      that filter will be verbose with it's output (use the -vo flag).

        "|/usr/local/bin/filter -vo /j/nancym/.elm/filter-errors"

      And repeat steps 6 and 7.  After you get filter to work you 
      will probably want to change the ``-vo'' flag back to ``-o''.

   
8]  After you have successfully tested filter in steps 6 and 7, edit
    ~/.elm/filter-rules so that it contains a modified version of the
    following:

     # if (subject contains "test") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.testing"
     if (to contains "www-talk") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.www-talk"
     if (to contains "hopos-l") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.hopos"

     Replace /j/nancym with your home directory path and
     /Mail with the name of your mail directory.  Replace the mailing 
     list string (e.g., "www-talk") and the name of the mail folder
     (e.g., IN.www-talk) with text for your mailing lists.

     Note that ``to contains...'' means either the To or Cc header contains...

     Rather than deleting the test line, it's useful to just turn it
     into a comment (by preceding it with #) so that you can easily
     use it for future testing.

Subject: ... 3.2 Tracking Your Incoming Mail
Followup-To: comp.mail.elm

You can get a short summary of filter's activity by typing:

    filter -s

For a longer summary type:

    filter -S

Or you can look at the log file itself, ~/.elm/filterlog.

You should regularly look at ~/.elm/filter-errors to make sure things 
are working.  You can automatically check filter-errors each time you
log in by putting the following in your .login:

    tail ~/.elm/filter-errors

Also you probably want to regularly delete filterlog and filter-errors so 
they don't fill up your disk space.  To get a summary of the filter log and 
clear it type:

    filter -cs

Thank you Flavell and Portia for responding to my message. I was able

VMS from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (ver 3.91). I am using the

Very existential.  But it is a bad idea for a user agent, especially one 
targeted at inexperienced users, to encourage bad netiquette.

But what if you need to do some research before you respond and your
site expires articles quickly?  What I do is save the article in a
folder named ToRespond and then use ``nn +ToRespond'' to open the
folder and post my response.  I have been burned many times by
flagging an article (using nn's l command) and then going back to
post my response and discovering that the article has expired.

What you say is correct - but if I attempt to create an (empty)
folder by using the A(dd) command from the L(ist) screen, nothing
happens - it does not give me the error message that "lray" is
reporting.
 
As one can see by looking in VMS_MAIL.C, there are several
PINE commands that are not supported when addressed to local
mailboxes - not all of these limitations are mentioned in
the README.VMS.  The commands are still needed, since they could
be addressed to remote folder collections (but we are not dealing
with that situation here).
 
I repeat, the correct values for folder-collections and
default-fcc are stated in the README.VMS (I am posting this from
an EBCDIC-based mainframe with erratic representation of square
brackets so I'm worried about trying to type it in here.)
I got bizarre results (not too different from the symptoms
reported here) when they were not set up correctly.

Yes, the VMS "MAIL" command could do that (unless you have set
it to FORWARD all messages).  But there is no need (apart from creating
the initial MAIL.MAI base if the user does not have one), because
VMS PINE is quite happy to S(ave) a message to a folder name that
does not exist, and will create it and add it to the folder list,
at least, that works for me.  (I suppose it's possible that there's
some problem that only occurs on DEC ALPHA Open/VMS and not on
VAX/VMS where I was installing it).

Just a minute, you say this happens when you try to _send_ a
mail.  Have you made sure to explicitly set
default-fcc=""
as required by the README.VMS?  The Fcc feature does not work under
VMS and has to be turned off like this.
 
I've made a few changes to my Web page, take a fresh look:

good luck

If netcom has another user agent available (such as ELM), check and
see if you get the same error with that software.  If so, the problem
isn't related to pine, but to other factors on the system.  At that
point, you need to talk to your system administrator.

On the other hand, if the other user agent is successful at sending
messages through that large of a distribution list then you're
probably better off using that mailer for the infrequent (at least I
hope it's infrequent) times you need to send to that large of a
distribution list.  It's probably not worth the effort to fix, unless
that fix simply involves updating the software to the latest version.

In a sense it already does. If there is no Newsgroups header then there
is no default groups to post a followup. But, I can always press ^R and
manually enter any newsgroups name to post the reply if I choose to do
so.

I don't need any support. As I said before, it is MY business to decide
what to do with email coming to me. Nor pine nor you nor anybody else can
tell me what to do. As a corollary to this, I am solely responsible for
the consequences of course.

Incorrect. The syntax for the contents of the header is more strict in
news than in mail, but the meaning is the same.

But wait! That is an admission that mail and news are not technically
the same thing. If they were, you could use a mail references header in
news.

P.S. There is at least one other header that changes meanings between
mail and news: Path. Since it has no use in outgoing messaging, nobody
cares what it contains.

Another incorrect assumption. You didn't have to assume what you
assumed. You could have assumed that I wrote what I meant. 

By "not correct", I meant that Pine's assumption is not the meaning that
the other system used.

Well, an admission that news and mail can be different for some people.
Progress is being made.

Yes, in nn you can do this by putting this line in your init file:

  set mailer mynewsmailer

And create a script called mynewsmailer that contains this:

  formail -R Newsgroups: Originated-In-Newsgroups: | /usr/lib/sendmail -t

After you characterized my statement about the difference between between
mail and news as elegant, I hate to have to mildly disagree with you here.
Using nn (I refuse to read news with a mail tool), I frequently save
articles to my local saved news folders and go back to them a day or so
later and (f)ollowup to them after they have been taken out of play.
Occasionally I (r)eply to them as well.  The nice thing about nn's behavior
here is that I have to take an explicit positive action to put the ball back
in play.  The difficulty with pine's approach is that it asks me convoluted
questions that I may be confused about the correct answers to.  One slip and
the ball I was fondling on the sidelines rolls onto the court and the
referee declares a foul against my side.

No, it's not trn that's responsible for this, it's you. 

On my system, trn saves things in individual files in a directory
structure that makes it clear that the source was news. In addition,
each file contains a Path header (which mail does not), and, even if I
somehow get confused as to the source of the data in the file, even
with all the clues I already mentioned, I can look at the first line of
the file where it says "Article nnnn of news.group.name:".

I chose that method. You chose the method you use, even if it was a
choice not to read the man page to find out how you could save things.

This would be quite forgiveable.  But, like the man said, if you find
the article expired on every Sabbath, then it would be wise to
fill up the ditch.

(Or at least have distinct folders mail-torespond and news-torespond,
such that news-torespond is just a cache for the common News spool
and has a longer expiration time.)

Can you imagine:

    User of integrated package types command to set alarm clock for
    11:50 am.

    Software prompts:  
    
       Would you also like to subtract $11.50 from your bank balance?

Default answer to question is of course 'no', but if asked enough
times, users will sometimes accidentally reply 'yes'.

The point being that there are some questions that are best left
unasked.  If the user wants to debit his balance, let him give the
appropriate command in a separate step.

This is one I send to my daughter-in-law who won't believe
my tales about how big the pigs are in the midwest....

Most ascii art is created painstakingly by the owner of       
the signature.                                                
                                                              
I make drawings, and also sketches quite frequently, always   
using a text editor (memacs) rather than a word processor.    
                                                              
Sketch your design first, You can use graph paper and allow   
one space for each character. Then begin drawing it with      
appropriate characters from the left of the screen, gradually 
working to the right. That way you won't have to adjust       
text that gets bumped over too far when new characters are    
added.                                                        
                                                              
My computer doesn't support overtype mode, but if yours does  
it is easy to go in and change characters without damaging the
already completed parts of your ascii art.                    
                                                              
There are a couple of excellent sources that I cannot         
access while in Tin Newsreader. Email me if you want          
me to look them up. Or you may have better luck with          
a search of some kind. use the term ascii art.                
                                                              
One is a newsgroup for ascii art. It is populated by very     
creative ascii artists who want to outdo each other and       
will rise to the challenge if you ask for a specific          
design. I recommended it to a net pal who needed a floral     
bouquet near valantines day.                                  
                                                              
Another is a big FAQ file of ascii art that someone has       
put together It was deep in one of those big internet         
directories. Some were worth copying for your own use.        
A lot weren't impressive.                                     
                                                              
Hope this helps

Please, read what I wrote.  I can set up my terminal emulator for UK-ASCII
(it is in fact identical to 7bit US-ASCII with the exception of the
hash codepoint, which in UK mode displays as pound-sterling).  This has
nothing to do with MIME charsets or PINE configuration parameter values -
neither MIME nor PINE had been invented at the time this misbegotten
7bit code was defined.

My $.02:
The best art in signatures is compact (4 lines max).  Any art longer than 
that gets to be tiring and a waste of space.

In general, short signatures are best for that reason, whether or not 
they contain art.

Sending art for art's sake is fine.  I enjoy seeing the clever creations.
BUT, keep the sigs short.

This may be the same problem we had here when the new version of sendmail was
installed.  Sendmail 8.6.10 on our AIX 3.2.5 machine caused what sounds like
the same problem with Pine 3.91.

The workaround was for Pine users to set their smtp-server variable to one of
our local SMTP hosts.  You could do the same using an appropriate Netcom
host.  (Sorry, but I can't suggest one.)

The solution was in the sendmail source code.  We removed the code in util.c
that generated the POSSIBLE ATTACK messages and fixed two problems: the Pine
distribution list limitation and the bogus log messages.

I can certainly understand your being frustrated with the situation, but I'm
not certain I would suggest mail bombing as helpful.  Just my 2 cents.

Good luck.  -dcb

    Hmmm, to my knowledge there is no such MIME charset defined as UK-ASCII.
Maybe a version of ISO 646 that goes under a different name...

This got me thinking, remembering that very old Pines would display any
characters not covered by US-ASCII as an underscore if you did not configure
Pine with the same character set with which the message was tagged, unless
you specifically told Pine to display all characters.
    I don't know if this might have been the problem, and I hope most
sites would have upgraded to 3.8* or 3.9* to eliminate this problem,
but I know there are some which haven't.
    The original poster wrote that the characters were visible when
viewing the mail *outside* of Pine, but not while in Pine, which is what
I find peculiar -- the later Pines pass all data to the display regardless
of your charset emulation; the worst they do is display a warning.

    You may include non-US-ASCII characters in headers, in the manner
quoted in the original post.  This is covered by MIME, and there is a
particular RFC whose number I've forgotten which describes this.  (Could
it be RFC1522?)  But no 8-bit data may appear in a header, so it must
be encoded in a manner similar to Q-P or BASE64.  I believe Eudora is one
of a few mailers which do this.

Nope, it isn't.  An 822 References line contains message-IDs of (or
plain-text pointers to) "other correspondence which this message
references."  These referenced messages need not necessarily be
precursors of the current one.  A 1036 References line however may only
contain backwards references, i.e. message-IDs of articles in the same
branch of the thread tree.  Son-of-1036 defines a new "See-Also" header
that has the same meaning as 822's References.

Of course they're not, and I never claimed they are.  I'm all for
keeping them apart.  This doesn't mean the user has to learn two
different interfaces (I have written a user agent that handles both news
and mail, with essentially the same interface for both, except for the
concepts that are unique to either), but I think it's important to keep
them seperated, and to make it clear to the user which is which.

Note that "absence of a 'proper' meaning" is not quite the same thing
as "there's no defined meaning".  Having no defined meaning for a
header actually makes it very safe to use -- it becomes just a comment
for the human reader.  "Absence of a 'proper' meaning" allows for
the presence of a fuzzy meaning, which is a little more risky -- but
no adverse effects have been obsered (in the non-pine cases).

Not so!  Please don't forget the context.

No conflict between Rnmail and Pnews, given that one is sending
email and the other is sending News.  The respective meanings of
the header have caused no trouble (in the non-pine cases).

Hi.

I'm a newbie with PINE 3.89 on Linux. I have a UUCP connection to my 
Internet provider and oddly enough, I can receive Internet e-mail but I 
can't send e-mail from my BBS to my Ineternet Provider. My e-mail message 
bounces almost immediately when I try to send:
	uux: otheruucphost: Sytem not found
	554 muhammad@u.washington.edu  ... unknown mailer error 1

Oddly enough, I can send e-mail to a local user on my BBS but not to 
internet. Any idea as to why this happens?

it's been driving me crazy for the past 2 weeks.

Thanks.

Muhammad

Why not?  I think it is.

Nowadays there are so many newbies on the net who don't really know what
they are doing, and who don't bother to read about netiquette either.  I
think it is definitely a Good Thing for a user agent to prevent users
from doing things they are not supposed to do, like posting a public
followup to a private email message.

Jason's script looks like it will be a big help to many of us who would 
like to make file distributions automatically.

I would like to add that not all users will be able to get access to a 
MIME mailer and that munpack can be used to decode saved, MIMEd files.

I can't say for sure where to find mpack/munpack, although I think I got 
mine at an ftp server at cmu.edu.

In the Setup, Config menu page down to editor and select C (change)
change editor to 

   	/usr/bin/vi

It looks like you have actually told pine to use pico (the default editor)
rather than vi. It also looks like you have told pine to use vi as your
default editor (enable-alternate-editor-implicitly). This means that
whenever to compose or reply to a message vi will be used rather than pico.

If you want to activate it depending on the situation, de-select
enable-alternate-editor-implicitly. Then when you are composing/replying 
you can type ^_ (this is Ctrl+Shift+Minus).

Hope this helps,

Forcing them to guess which medium the message they are reading came
from, and thus how they should respond, does not help them communicate.

That's very nice. How you operate doesn't define how others do.

Can we please stop thinking in a "sometimes means always" mode?

Sometimes there is no screwdriver available. Sometimes all you have is
a phillips and you need to drive a flathead. So, sometimes, people use
mail and news in the same way. This proves NOTHING AT ALL about how
they use it "all the time"; it does not prove that I use
non-mailing-list mail the same way I use news, nor does it prove
anything about how anyone else uses news and mail.

>A netnews group access-restricted to five users is not a "broadcast

If you are going to use a five-user mailing list as an example of
broadcast mail, then you need to accept five-user newsgroups the same
way.

The reposting of articles from one group to another is a different
issue. There are people who are upset when their articles get stolen,
umm, "reposted" from one group to another already.

Most of it does. On the other hand, "content-type" is, as I recall, a
defined extension to the mail standard.

RFC 1036 messages conform to a subset of RFC 822. However, part of the
conformance comes only because RFC 822 says that undefined headers can
be ignored. "Newsgroups" and "Path" are two of those.

The first step to the fix is to get people to stop saying "I don't treat
mail and news as different things so nobody has a problem."

I can understand that non-English speaking people might have trouble
with directions in English, but that would be true with any program,
not just pine.

Pine is SIMPLE to use.  I had absolutely no trouble with it as a 
newbie and have trained CHILDREN and adults with absolutely no
problems.  All questions are very simple to understand.

I can't imagine someone being dumb enough to say "yes" to doing
something if they didn't know what it was.  I can understand them
hitting y by accident or by habit.  However, there is that second
chance with the warning about thousands of readers.  Sheesh, anyone
can understand that.

Personally, I wish all of you who hate pine would just get off this
group.  No one is convincing anyone else.  This newsgroup used to
be a friendly, helpful group until this stupid thread started.
This morning I had 19 messages and 12 were from this thread.  

Now that I have aired my frustration with it, I intend to delete
without reading any further posts about this topic.  I hope
it dies quickly.

a NEWBIE who LOVES pine as it is....

 You can't do that from within .pinerc. However you can recompile the code
 and change the prefix value to ":" in the file "reply.c".

Hi,

I have a severe hearing impairment and mail/news is my lifeline. I am 
forced to work at home generally, but reading my mail and news on-line is 
via a 2400 line which is too slow.

Is there ANY way (pine or other) that I might be able to in effect read 
mail/news off-line? eg for mail using the folder directly or exporting to 
a big text file, for news I guess I'd have to export. But how can I deal 
with these big text files - is there a program (PC PINE?) which can 
'handle' them?

Thanks for any help with this one,
Paul Lunney

1) Save this patch into a file "pine3.91.diff" and remove my ramblings
2) Get a clean copy of pine (or remove any changes you have made)
3) Type
   patch < pine3.91.diff
   which will apply the patch to the appropriate files in the directory
   pine3.91.  All of them should succeed without intervention.
4) cd to pine3.91 and type "build sol".  There will be some warnings but
   it will compile (at least using gcc 2.6.3 - no promises if you are using
   Sun Compiler)

Perhaps the Pine developers would consider melding these tweaks into the
distribution.  Also, I would appreciate it if they would make solaris an
ANSI compile, instead of non-ANSI, as both the Sun compiler and gcc are
ANSI compliant.  Thanks.

This is mostly a matter of syntax.  822 and 1036 already treat headers
differently in that they use different sets of headers (notably To:,
In-Reply-To: vs. References:, and of course Newsgroups:).  You might
use an 822 parser on news headers, but not something like mailx that
interprets them.

Probably the best argument against Pine's behavior is that a large
installed base of software sends Newsgroups: headers in email.  Even if
this is against the RFCs, it's desirable for Pine to avoid making it
routine to post a reply to a message received by mail.

I am sure this a FAQ, but how would one change the reply character in 
Pine from the > to another char - such as a colon :.

This is fine except for one thing... it obviously doesn't say "you received
this message as private mail" in the same question. If it did, people would
not be so surprised to hear that the message they quoted to the net hadn't
been intended to be public.

In such a case it is a breach of netiquette to reply at all. Or at least it's
counterproductive.

Do not use them. Use only the standard character set for
your terminal type, based on an old mainframe terminal.

They do not recognize more modern character sets, and will
not print them properly.

I always adapt. If I am talking British money, I write
out 'pounds sterling' or use # or LB that most people there 
would understand. Their pound sterling symbol is likely not
to print or display on the receiving end.

Time will tell -- I am not sure.  I reinstalled sendmail here to be
8-bit transparent, and nobody noticed except the users who had
requested this change.

For a real-life example I refer you to the battle of Apple vs MacTCP
users.

This thread is not pine-specific, so follow-ups are set to
comp.mail.headers.

So we should just send 8-bit characters in SMTP since everybody knows
that they're just ISO-8859-1?  Even though RFC 821 says not to?  We all
know that that was just a historical mistake because old PDP-10
computers used to pack characters in 7 bits.  And lots of folks are
sending 8-bit ``RFC 821'' SMTP right now and like it that way.

They really should be setting Followup-To: poster and summarizing.

Personally, I wish there were a standard header that meant a message had
been both mailed and posted, because some people do this as a matter of
course, and I'd like to be able to easily tell procmail to throw such
messages away.

Oh, good golly. Someone, at some point, knew it was news. Whether it was
NNTP or IMAP or reading the news spool directly.  The point is the same.
Someone is throwing that information away, and they should not be.

If it was news in a news folder, it would be news when they copied it to
a private folder. Again, someone is throwing that information away.

I guess the answer is "no". So, I guess that means that an existing
application will continue to do what it has done.

It does say a lot about the concept of "interoperability", which is

Why not?

Why should Pine EVER ask a user about posting a reply to what it knows is
mail?

Hi,

I think this question has been asked before, but I am wondering if 
somebody's gonna tell me again.

On a mailing list, Pine shows a plus sign before an email which is Cc'd to
keviny@somewhere.else, when my email address is keviny@hk.super.net and
keviny@hk.linkage.net.  Why?  Does Pine only match the username and 
ignore the domain name?  Thanks a lot.

It is true that "folder collections" and "news collections" are defined 
separately.  It is also true that the former are read/write (can be read 
or have messages saved to folders in them), whilst the latter is read-only.

Note that the operative words are "folder collection", *not* "mail 
collection".

It is quite possible to save any item (e-mail message or News article) to
a folder in a folder collection.  Indeed this is a very valuable way of 
keeping important or interesting News articles so that they do not 
disappear when the News server expires and deleted them.

Whilst it would therefore presumably be possible to interpret the 
presence of an item in a news-collection folder as "this article is News" 
it is *not* possible to interpret the presence of an item in a 
folder-collection folder as meaning it MUST be an e-mail message.  It is 
quite possible to be a News article that was saved there.

I would  be worried by the prospect of separating folders into two 
"types": mail (only) and news (only).  I find Pine's integrated approach 
very useful, and many of our users are happily using Usenet News who 
would, I believe, otherwise have got to grips with it.

In view of all the hoo-hah about private e-mail/posting to News I have 
taken the step of modifying (mending?) our (supplied but not supported by 
us) Tin newsreader so that it does not include the "Newsgroups:" header 
line when mailing an article.

I realise this only affects people receiving articles mailed _from_ our 
Tin, but would expect on the whole to cover most situations.  (I suspect 
most of our users find an interesting article and then e-mail it to a 
friend here.)

If more people took the time to make such changes to their newsreaders 
rather than spouting off here perhaps the problem could gradually be 
eliminated? (Rattles cage and prepares to stand back pronto! ;-)

do we have to do something during compile time to activate the -w

There is obvioulsy no easy and correct solution to this thread. May I 
suggest that those interested in continuing it, do so directly. This list

In comp.mail.pine, dbrenner@nemo.weeg.uiowa.edu (Doug Brenner) says:

    You may also consider upgrading (again) to BSD sendmail 8.6.11, which
was released a few days ago and corrects these POSSIBLE ATTACK messages.
I don't remember whether the official fix solves the problem with lists,
or whether this is even mentioned in the release info, but if what you did
worked for you, I would imagine the official release is the same.

    Just to make it clear, this problem is NOT a problem with Pine, but
rests with the mail transport agent (sendmail).  You won't get results by
posting in comp.mail.pine about it, but you might get results by asking
your SysAdmin to quickly upgrade from sendmail 8.6.10.

    If anybody wishes to ask whether sendmail 8.6.11 does indeed solve
the problem with large (more than 20 or 30) lists of recipients in mail
from Pine, the place to ask is comp.mail.sendmail.

Yeah, right. I spent yesterday morning teaching Pine to some beginner
Unix users. I thought Pine would be a suitable program for them because
it shows a lot of help on screen and asks for confirmation before users
can do anything stupid.

But it seems that I was partly wrong. My experiences yesterday seem to
indicate that Pine might not be the best e-mail program for those whose
native language is something else than English. Some of my pupils, who
actually speak and read English, the Pine menus and prompts were just
too much to comprehend (for example, a few had problems telling 
apart the "Folder Index" and "Folder List" functions). The reason might
bee the load of too much new vocabulary in a new situation. I think the
same might apply to an english-speaking net newbie.

After yesterday I don't wonder too much for somebody not knowing 
what "Do you want to post to the newsgroup?" means.

I don't have any problems with what you suggest above. But, I think Pine
already does that. I wonder if you ever used Pine yourself. But, when
you hit R, Pine asks you if you want post a followup to the Usenet. The
default is NO. If you hit the return button your answer goes only via
e-mail. Even if you press Y. After you are done and ready to send it again
says this time "this might go to thousands of people do you want to do
that?" If you find these messages cryptic and have better suggestions go
ahead it's fine with me. Also, it is not very difficult to know if a message
has arrived from news or email with Pine. I don't know all the possible
setups. But, here, my incoming folders, private folders and news folders
are clearly separated. The only time I might be confused is when I save
a news message to a private folder and forget where it came from. Ok, that
part can be enhanced and again no problem.

Now, for the etiquette: there are some very hot groups. Sometimes, somebody
gets very angry with what you have said there and sends you an email with
threats and/or curses. In such a case, I don't think that it is a breach
of netiquette to reply on the Usenet.

If I get mail with the following header:

 Content-Type: application/pgp; format=mime; x-action=signclear; x-originator=71FB29E1

pine tells me (I don't have pgp installed):

  [Part 1, Application/PGP  1.2KB]
  [Can not display this part. Use the "V" command to save in a file]


If I read the same message with elm, I get:

This message contains data in an unrecognized format, application/pgp,
which can either be viewed as text or written to a file.

What do you want to do with the application/pgp data?
1 -- See it as text
2 -- Write it to a file
3 -- Just skip it


I find the elm behaviour much more helpful, as I know that in this
case I can chose option 1 and be able to read the text. Is there some
option in pine which allows me to do that? If not, would the pine team
consider implementing something similar?

(Yes, I know, I could install pgp, but that is a different discussion)

A friend of mine asked me this question, and I can't figure it out either.
I would think this would be simple...

The question:
By the way, Pine is great.  Is there any way you can mark what you've
read in a newsgroup with Pine?  I like the interface much more than
nn, but it doesn't remember what messages I've read, and I can't figure
out how to make it work.

If you know this, please email.

Thanks,

Date: 14 Mar 1995 06:07:08 GMT
Message-Id: <3k3bqc$hnu@kernighan.cs.umass.edu>

Hi,

I am looking for a mail program that runs under plain DOS and can 
deal with a unix mbox format mail file (like /usr/spool/mail/user).

The mailer should understand MIME, and should be able to launch
applications for body-parts of specific MIME types automatically.

To send outgoing mail, perhaps it could make a mbox file,
or whatever. I could add in dial-up and file-transfer scripts 
to take care of the rest.

Essentially, I am trying to help a user who wishes to use MIME on 
an offline PC running plain DOS. None of the QWK readers seem
to know anything close to attachments and launching applications.
I thought PC-Pine should do it, but unlike unix pine, pc-pine insists on
going on-line over to an IMAP daemon.

Thanx in advance ..

When I first set up my pine mailer to view newsgroups, it had 
automatically subscribed me to a kazillion groups, a zillion of which I 
have no interest in. How do I unsubscribe to them all quickly so I can 
then subscribe to the ones I want? It is so slow removing them one at a time.

Mpack and munpack are utilities for encoding and decoding
(respectively) binary files in MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extensions) format mail messages.  For compatibility with older forms
of transferring binary files, the munpack program can also decode
messages in split-uuencoded format.  The Macintosh version can also
decode messages in split-BinHex format.

In short, munpack is the MIME equivalent of uudecode/binhex.

Versions are included for unix, pc, os2, mac, amiga and archimedes
systems.  The canonical FTP site for this software is

This is weird:

With PC-Pine (Winsock), when I compose a message and read in a file using 
the file open dialog from the floppy drive I lose my sentmail folder. 
Pine says "sentmail doesn't exist, create one ?" When I cancel out of 
compose and list my folders I find that only the inbox folder remains. 
The savemail folder is missing too.

It works if I read in a file from the C: drive or don't use the 
file open dialog (via ^T) and just type the file name and path (A:) at 
the pine prompt.

Anyone run into this?

Yes Pine developers, please make the above changes!!! Also, while you are
at it, please don't hard code /usr/local/... into any of the code or documentation
files. Not eveyone wants to install pine, or it's libraries in /usr/local/.... You
could add code to either the main makefile or the build script and let the user
say where they want to code to be installed.

Subject: check for new mail in mult. folders
Date: 14 Mar 1995 18:14:21 GMT
Message-Id: <3k4mdt$ljt@news.rain.org>


I have been using procmail to filter my incoming mail into
different inbox folders in pine.  Everything works fine, 
except, I can't tell if I have new mail in these folders.

When I use frm or nfrm from the elm package, they
erroneously report that I have read mail in these folders
when there is new/unread mail in them.

If I try to us the from command (SunOs 4.1), I can's seem
to be able to specify my folders with the -e argument.

Please help, as I am growing tired of having to run pine
every time I want to check if I have new mail.

Might I suggest that you think carefully about what you are saying here.

It is extremely poor etiquette to post personal mail to the net. However,
it is not the place for a user interface program to *enforce* this sort
of behaviour. On the other hand, it is a bad thing for a user interface
program to *encourage* dangerous behaviour.

Would you accept Pine making a note that a message was received via mail but
is a reply to a news posting, and asking if you would like to post a response
to news instead of sending private email. You would be able to continue to
use Pine in an antisocial manner, if that's what you want (it's not clear that
this is the cause, mind you... I am not accusing you of violating acceptable
behaviour) but people would no longer be accidentally doing so.

Sure it is. If there's no defined meaning for a header then it's likely to
be used in incompatible ways by different programs. As is the case here.

If a program doesn't expect a header to be used, it should mark it somehow
as commentary lest some other program latch onto it and use it. The X-
convention is a reasonable one here (or is there software that reads and uses
X- headers? In that case perhaps something like "X-TRN-Newsgroups" should
be used).

> The problem occurs only if conflicting meanings get
> established, and that is not the case here.

That is exactly the case here.

Rnmail uses "Newsgroups" to mean "Note -- this message is a reply to a
message posted in the following groups". Pnews uses it to mean "This
message is posted to the following groups". Pine uses it to mean "Post
this message to the following groups".

I agree, it's annoying and confusing, but sometimes people ask for this:

	"I do not read this group, so please Cc me in any responses"

which is also in some cases annoying, but an appropriate use of Cc in a
followup.

Unifying the model is useful. Unifying the *messages* is not. If you want to
extend the system, or unify it, you need to make an effort to let people
know what the limitations of the distribution are. You especially need to
keep track of what the communication channel normal responses should be sent
to is.

TRN, for example, does a very good job of letting people know what the
distribution restrictions on a message are: it displays a message prior
to posting describing the expected distribution of the message in plain
english (this organization, many machines, this country, the whole world)
and gives the user a chance to back out. It could do better (This message
is cross-posted to misc.test, it is likely you will recieve dozens of
messages from automatic response programs, for example) but at least it
makes an effort.

It isn't. The mailing list manager has already marked the response address
correctly, so it doesn't have to.

Yes, you can argue that perhaps it would be nice if you had some flags to
indicate the message was to a mailing list (nationwide newsgroup) but that
doesn't excuse discarding that information.

A netnews group restricted to a local server is not broadcast either. And
TRN lets you know when your message is going to be distributed outside that
channel, when you post it.

If they use TRN, they won't have that problem. If they have Pine, they will.

This is supposed to be an argument *for* unification?

Only if you don't tell the user where it's going in understandable terms,
and you don't add default destinations that the originator didn't intend.

Certainly. MIME is a later standard. A program that doesn't expect MIME
should certainly make no assumptions about the meaning of MIME headers.

That's true. That's why I'm recommending fixing both.

It's going to be difficult to get Pine fixed, though.

There's more than one consistent subset of the actions.

You mean to me as an author of news/mail handling software they aren't
important?  That I can ignore the difference?  Then what's the

``Correct'' in this context is simply inflammatory.  Just what I was

This is diatribe, not dialogue.  My earlier post tried to persuade the
news/mail strict-dichotomists that there's another way to look at the
world, not that the other way was the ONLY way.

Thanks to:

Vladimir Solnicky <vs@utia.cas.cz>
Ramon J Hontanon <ramon@template.com>

for their instrumental advice (name used in /etc/services must match name 
used in /etc/inetd.conf).  The initial stage of reading UNIX inboxes from 
PC-PINE at my site was a success!

To those who requested the "Big Secret" if and when I got it all together 
.... here is what I learned:

=========================================================================

Setting up PC-PINE to allow reading an INBOX located on an SCO
machine


This step-by-step assumes:

Proper installation of winsock.
tcpman.exe as the PC-tcp element.
The user has an account on the SCO machine.
The email system on the SCO machine is functional.
You are using the pre-compiled SCO code for Pine3.91.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1)   Place imapd (found in the pine3.91/bin directory on the pre-
     compiled SCO distribution) in the /etc directory with the
     mode and ownership as follows.

-rwx--x--x  1 bin  bin    427500 Mar 08 09:41 /etc/impad


2)   Edit /etc/inetd.conf to include the following line:

imap   stream  tcp    nowait   root   /etc/imapd    imapd


3)   Edit /etc/services to include the following line:

imap   143/tcp


4)   Issue a SIGHUP (kill -1) to inetd's PID in the process table. 
     This will cause inetd to re-read the inetd.conf file (no need to
     reboot).


5)   Edit your PINERC file (related to the PC-PINE installation). 
     Note: PINERC will not exist until you have attempted to run
     PC-PINE the first time.  Required fields for remote access of
     your INBOX are:

user-id=
smtp-server= <------ Needed to COMPOSE mail
inbox-path=<------ Needed for accessing INBOX
incoming-folders=
default-fcc=
postponed-folder=

The user-id field needs to contain the logname of the individual
who's INBOX we are accessing.

The smtp-server field is the name of the server that has an smtp
channel setup for email.

The inbox-path is how you latch onto the imapd server.  The
syntax is: inbox-path={machine}/usr/spool/mail/logname
where machine is substituted for the hostname of the server you
configured imapd on and logname is the users login name.

The incoming-folders, default-fcc and postponed-folder are
optional.  If you plan on maintaining one set of folders, you will
have to use syntax similar to the syntax used in the inbox-path parameter.

This method of configuration will require the user to supply his
UNIX password to gain access to his inbox.  In my particular
scenario, this is OK.  You may try the rimapd concept to alleviate
the need for password provision (?).  The rimapd concept is
discussed in the distribution documentation.

I'm curious, once you set up your folder-collections, are you able to view
the folders in PC-Pine properly?

I've found, although I'm using Solaris imap, that the folders drop the two
first characters in the pcpine (winsock or pcnfs) display.

I was told that it was a bug that had been corrected in a recent release of
imap and today I've installed the March BETA release but it hasn't made a 
difference.

There is definitely a religious issue here, and frankly I'm sick of it 
eating up so much space in my mailbox. I was going to write a long 
message about how I came to this proposal, but I've decided, in the 
interest of getting people to actually read this message, to get right to 
the point. 

My proposed solution?

Make posting news a completely different keystroke (for argument's sake,
Ctrl-?). Then ask once or twice whether they are sure, and if there is an
email address in the To: line, ask if they also want to send an email to
that person. 

Scenario: I am composing an email.
  Result: No change. I type my message and hit Ctrl-X. Message gets sent.

Scenario: I am composing a news post.
  Result: Slight change. I type my message and hit Ctrl-?. Message gets 
          posted to newsgroup.  

Scenario: I am reading email and want to reply. (No Newsgroups: header)
  Result: No change. I type my reply and hit Ctrl-X. Message gets sent.

Scenario: I am reading news and want to post a followup. 
  Result: Slight change. I type my reply and hit Ctrl-?. Message gets 
          posted to newsgroup.  

Scenario: I am reading email and want to reply via email to a message which 
          was sent as a reply to a news post. (Newsgroup: header exists)
  Result: I type my reply and hit Ctrl-X. Recipient gets message. I am not
          asked if I want to post the message anywhere because I did not hit
          Ctrl-?.

Scenario: I am reading email and want to post my reply to a newsgroup.
          (Newsgroup: header may or may not exist)
  Result: I type my reply and hit Ctrl-?. Message gets posted to 
          whatever newsgroups are on the Newsgroups: line (to which
          I may add or remove newsgroups while replying). If there
          is a recipient in the To: line, I am asked if want to also
          send the message to that person via email.

This way, news never gets posted without an explicit news-posting
keystroke, and if I know nothing of news and get a message in my box,
reply and hit Ctrl-X, I won't be bothered with news issues at all. It is
just as easy to post news as it was before, just a different keystroke. 

Questions? Comments? I'm sure I forgot something, but I think this is 
workable, and it sidesteps the religious issue rather neatly, I think.

Message-Id: <3k4cvu$ilk@sat.ipp-garching.mpg.de>

Until a few days ago I confess that I was running PINE 3.05.  Now I am
running PINE 3.91.  The problem is that the new version doesn't see all of
my old mail folders.  That they are still there can be demonstrated by
running the old version.  How do I make the new PINE recognize the old
folders?

My folders retain their integrity .... names and all.

I *have* found trouble in addressbooks, however.  Not every address in 
the list seems to function properly.  They all appear to be OK 
(visually), but when you use the nickname, it does not always pull up the 
address.  Even if you use the ^T keystroke and pull it right off the 
list!  Still, no joy.

Not all addresses are problems, but certain ones are (consistently).

The address book is a _copy_ of the system wide globaladdress book.

What is electronic mail? 

Electronic mail is similar to postal mail.  You
create a message, address it, and send it on its way.  Pine is a simple,
easy-to-use electronic mail program that runs on the multiuser systems
FALCON, LARK, KUHUB, STAT1, and UKANAIX.  After you successfull y login to
your multiuser system account you may access the Pine e-mail program. 
Message are created in Pine using the Pico editor, which is similar to
most popular word processors.
	For more information on the Pine e-mail program look in KUfacts,
the campus-wide information system, under Departmental information ->
Academic Computing Services -> Online Documentation or open the URL:
http://kufacts.cc.ukans.edu/cwis/units/acs/documen
tation/General/writeups_index.html
   
Your e-mail address 

Like a postal address, your e-mail address is made up
of several parts: username@hostname.domain Your username is the name you
use to login to the multiuser system.  Suppose for example your username
is joe.  The hostname is the name of the computer where you have your
account, in this case falcon.  The domain name is the same for everyone
using Comp uting Services systems: cc.ukans.edu The e-mail address for joe
would be: joe@falcon.cc.ukans.edu

How to get started 

Start the Pine e-mail program after you have logged into your account on
FALCON, KUHUB, LARK, STAT1, or UKANAIX, by entering the following command
from the system prompt:  pine
	If this is the first time you have started the Pine program, a
Welcome to Pine screen is displayed.  Press any key to go to the Main
Menu. 

Read messages 
If you have new electronic mail, you are notified after
login to your multiuser account. To read new mail messages: 

1.	From the Main Menu in Pine, press I (or i, Pine is not case sensitive) to open the INBOX folder.  New incoming e-mail messages are numbered in the INBOX folder according to time received and are indicated by an N next to the message number.  
2.	Use the up- and down-arrow keys or type the message number to select a message, then press <enter> (or <return>) to view the message.
	Press <spacebar> to read the next page of a multi-page message.  Press the hyphen key to go back to the previous page.  Press <tab> or N to read the next unread message.
To return to the index of mail messages press I.
To return to the Main Menu press M.

Reply to a message

The Reply command allows you to send an answer directly to the person who
sent you an e-mail message. 

1.	View the original message. 

2. 	Press R to Reply to the message.  To include the original message text,
press Y in response to the prompt. 

3.	You do not need to enter the e-mail address of the person in the To: 
field.  The Subject: field is filled in as: Re: (the original message 
subject line)

4. 	Enter your reply into the Pico text editor.  Pico is a full-screen
editor, which means you may use many features such as cutting and pasting
text and a spell checker.  To find out more about Pico commands, press ^G
for help or see the in BriefÑPico: A
 simple text editor on the KU multiuser systems. 

5. 	When you are finished press ^X to send the message.  You return to the
message screen. Note: The ^ character refers to the <ctrl> key on a PC
(IBM-compatible) or the <control> key on a Macintosh.  To execute commands
requiring the <control> keys, hold down the <ctrl> or <control> key and
press the required character. 

Delete a message

Delete erases a message from a folder.  In order to conserve disk space
delete messages you have read and do not want to save.  (To save messages
in another folder see the in BriefÑElectronic mail on the multiuser
systems: Pine, advanced commands.)

1. 	View the message to be deleted or highlight it in the index of
messages. 

2.	Press D to Delete the message.
	Press U to Undelete a message.

Compose a message

Compose allows you to write and mail a message to any electronic address on the Internet. 

1. From anywhere within the program, press C to access the Compose Message
command.  You are now in the Pico text editor. 

2. In the To: field, enter the e-mail address of the person you are
sending the message to then press <tab>. 

3. If you would like to copy others on the message, enter their addresses,
separated by a comma, in the Cc: field then press <tab>. 

4. To attach a file to the mail message enter the file name in the
Attchmnt: field. (See the Advanced Pine in Brief.) Press <tab>. 

5.  Enter a one-line description of the message in the Subject: field. 
Press <tab>. 

6. Enter your message in the Message Text area. 

7. Press ^X to send the message, and confirm by pressing Y.  Cancel the
message at any time by pressing ^C. 

Print messages

You may be able to print messages directly to a printer attached to your
desktop computer.  To print messages you must ensure that your Pine
printer setup is configured properly.  To check your printer setup: 

1. Go to the Main Menu from anywhere in the program by pressing M. 

2. Enter an S to access the Setup command. 

3. Enter a P for Printer. 

4. Enter a 1 to direct the messages to your local printer,
attached-to-ansi. 

Note: Read the information in number 1 to determine if you can print. 
Some attached printers may not work with this command.  If you dial-in,
whether or not you can print may depend on the terminal emulation or
communications program you are using. 

5. To Print a mail message, view the message on the screen and press Y. 

Quit Pine

To Quit Pine press Q from anywhere within the program.  If you deleted
messages from folders, you are asked to confirm the deletions.  If you
moved messages from folders, you are asked to confirm the move. 

Notes and hints 

¥ Dial-in users may experience problems with garbage
characters on the screen and keyboard malfunctions when using Pine.  This
may be caused by Pine not recognizing your terminal type.  If you are
having problems on KUHUB, enter the following command from
 the system prompt:
	pico  login.com
Add the following line:
	$ set terminal/device=vt100

On the other multiuser systems, FALCON, LARK, STAT1, and UKANAIX you need
to determine which UNIX shell you are using.  If you are unsure which
shell you are using from the system prompt enter the command: 
	echo  $SHELL

The letters ksh indicate the Korn shell, csh indicates the C shell.
	If you are using the Korn shell add the following line to the file
.profile: 
	export   TERM=vt100

If you are using the C shell add the following line to the file .login:
	setenv   term  vt100  
		To edit the files using the Pico text editor, from the system
		prompt enter the command:
		pico  filename
	where filename is the name of the file you are editing.

Save messages in folders

Mail messages may be moved from the INBOX folder and organized by topic in
message folders.  When considering which messages to save remember that
disk space is limited so please save only those messages you need.  To
save a message to a folder: 

1. View the message on the screen. 

2. Press S to Save the message. 

3. Enter the folder name and press <enter>.  If the folder does not exist
you will be prompted to create the folder. 

4. If you would like to save to an existing folder and have forgotten its
name, press ^T to see a list of existing mail folders. 

Save messages as text files

An e-mail message may be saved or exported to text file in your home
directory or a subdirectory.  The file can then be copied, moved, edited,
or printed.  To Export a mail message to a text file: 

1. View the message on the screen. 

2. Press E to Export the message. 

3. Enter a file name for the message and press <enter>. 

The message is now saved as a text file. 

Including text files

Text files created in another editor or on your desktop computer may be
included in a mail message.  If the text file was created on a desktop
computer it must be saved as a ACSII (or DOS) text file.  It may be copied
to the home directory of your multius er account in one of two ways: 

¥	If you dial-in to your multiuser account using Kermit or some other
communications program that supports the Kermit file transfer protocol,
follow the instructions in the Kermit in Brief for the commands to copy a
file from your home computer to your mu ltiuser account. 

¥	If you dial-in via a SLIP or PPP connection or have an on campus
Ethernet connection, you may use one of the shareware ftp programs, WS_FTP
or Fetch to transfer the file from your desktop computer to your multiuser
account.  See the appropriate program documentation. 

To include a text file in a mail message:

1. From anywhere within the Pine program, press C to Compose a new mail
message.  Enter the e-mail address and subject line. 

2. Position the cursor in the message area where the text file is to be
inserted and press ^R. 

3. Enter the name of the file and press <enter> or to view a list of all
the files in your home directory press ^T and select the file name from
the file list. 

Attaching files

Files located on your multiuser account may be Attached to a mail message
as a separate file.  An attached file may be of any file format, i.e.,
text or binary. An attached file is encoded in the MIME format.  For
someone to decode the attached file, they also must be using a MIME 
compatible mail reader, such as Pine, to read their e-mail.

1. From the Main Menu press C to Compose a message. 

2. In the Attchmnt: field enter the name of the file.  To see a list of
all the file name in your home directory press ^T.  Highlight the filename
and press S to select the file to attach.  The file name appears in the
Attchmnt: field of the mail header. 

3. You may attach more than one file, by seperating the file names with a
comma and no spaces. 

Signature files

A signature file is a text file containing your name, affiliation, mail
address, and anything of interest you would like to append to every mail
message you send.  By convention, signatures are not more than 5 lines
long.  Pine checks for a file in your h ome directory called .signature
(or on KUHUB .sig) and appends it to outgoing mail messages. 
	To create a signature file using the Pico editor:

1. Enter the following command at the system prompt:  pico .signature (or
.sig on KUHUB). 

2. Enter the text of your signature file.  Press ^X to save the file. 
When you Compose, Reply, or Forward using Pine, you see the signature in
the Message Text area.  It may be deleted (^K) if it is not needed. 
Address Book

Your Address Book organizes e-mail addresses and allows you to assign each perosn a nickname.  When you Compose, Reply, or Forward a mail message you enter the persons nick name instead of full e-mail address.  To add entries to your address book you may 
either copy them from incoming e-mail messages or enter them into the address book manually.  To copy an e-mail address from an incoming mail message to the address book:

1. View the message on the screen. 

2. Press T to Take the address and place it in the address book. 

3. Enter a nickname to refer to the person. 

4. Enter the full name of the person as last name first, followed by a
comma then a space, and the first name. 

5. Enter the e-mail address of the person.
	The entry is added to the address book. 

To retrieve an e-mail address from the address book: 

1. From the Main Menu press C to Compose a new message. 

2. Enter the nickname of the person in the To: field. The nickname expands
to the full name and e-mail address. 

Distribution mailing lists

In the address book you may create distribution lists to send e-mail to
people with similar interests, such as members of an organization or
department.  To create a distribution mailing list: 

1. From the Main Menu press A to access the Address Book. 

2. Press S to Create a List. 

3. Enter a long name for the list. 

4. Enter the nickname for the list that you will use to refer to the list
by in the To: field of Compose. 

5. Enter the e-mail addresses of the persons on the mailing list.  If the
person is already in your address book, enter only the nickname you refer
to them by. 

6. When you have entered all the addresses enter a blank address to
finish. 

To use the distribution mailing list, enter the nick name of the list in
the To: field of the Compose, Reply, or Forward commands. 

Forward your mail

Your mail messages may be forwarded to another computer system on the
Internet.  On FALCON, LARK, STAT1, or UKANAIX create file called .forward. 
To create the file using the Pico editor, enter the following from the
system prompt:
	pico  .forward

Enter the address where your mail is to be forwarded.  For example:
	student@kuhub.cc.ukans.edu

Press <enter> after the address and exit Pico by pressing ^X.
	On KUHUB, from the DCL prompt ($) enter the command: mail

At the Mail> prompt enter the new address: SET FORWARD
"IN%""username@host.domain""" (those are double quotes, and there are
three at the end of the command.)

Quit Pine

To Quit Pine press Q from anywhere within the program.  If you deleted
messages you are asked to confirm the deletions. 

Applying a command to several mail messages

There are many times when you would like to apply one command to several
mail messages at once.  For example, you might want to Delete or Print
more than one message at a time.  The Select command allows you to select
messages and the Apply command performs an action on the selected
messages.  To select messages: 

1. Go to the folder index by pressing I. 

2. Press the semicolon (;).  You may select messages either one a time, or
by some type of criteria.  The criteria you may use includes: 

¥	All the messages in the open folderÑpress A.

¥	Only the current messageÑpress C. 

¥	Certain messages by numbersÑpress N and enter a comma-delimited list of
message numbers. 

¥	By message dateÑpress D and enter On, Before, or Since (O,B, or S) and
the date. 

¥	By a text string in the Subject or From fieldsÑpress T and enter the
text. 

3. Continue to Select messages until all the required messages are
selected. 

To Apply a command to selected messages:

1. Press A to access the Apply command. 

2. From the Apply menu choose one of the following commands: D to Delete,
R to Reply, F to Forward, Y to Print, T to Take the Address, S to Save to
a messages folder, E to Export to a text file, * to Flag as important, and
| to Pipe to a UNIX command.

Use `pico -w filename' - I think it can handle lines up to 256

It was asked before - by me - but I never saw a definative answer.  On my
system the problem is actually the opposite of yours:  Mail addressed to
user@mail (i.e. from someone on the same machine) always gets the plus
sign, but mail addressed to user@mail.bcpl.lib.md.us sometimes does and
sometimes does not. It's very frustrating to users whose personal mail is
buried among hundreds of mailing list messages, since they can't count on
the plus signs to make their personal mail easily identifiable. 
 
The only pattern I can discern (but can't guarantee 100% reproducability) is:
 o Mail to user@mail from a sender on the same machine always shows up 
   with a plus sign.
 o Mail to user@mail.bcpl.lib.md.us from a sender on the same machine

Help.
Ok, I'm a LINUX new user and have tried to get the answer to this 
question from too many people... No luck in man pages or sysadmin.

Is there anyway to configure Pine to automatically place mail from 
certain users is their folders?  I.E. Mail from Bob@bob.net would be 
automatically put into folder BOB.

Email response is preferred, but a followup is fine; you all are doing me 
a favor, I'm not gonna complain.

Thanks alot,
Jon

Yes... in the Setup/Config screen find:

"saved-msg-name-rule" and set it to "by-recipient"

Note that this setting is also handy for saving newsgroup messages into a 
folder of the same (newsgroup) name.

This has been a puzzle to me ( I haven't thought about an automatical
way of doing it.) A person asked me if we could return the unwanted
e-mail to the original sender and make it as if is from the 
mail damond. I feel funny and say why don't you just delete 
it and return a mail saying that you don't want to receive mail from
the person!

Any way of doing it?

If you select the "news-approximates-new-status" feature, Pine will use
the last message you mark as deleted as the "high water mark" for what 
you've seen, and show everything after than with an "N".

The -w option disables word wrap, (automatically moving words at the end
of a line to the next line).  It doesn't stop pico from splitting lines
that it thinks are too long when it reads in a file. 

Maybe you could modify the pico source (disclaimer: I've never even seen
the pico source) to allow lines that are long enough for your purposes.  I
doubt you'll be able to get pico to allow lines of arbitrary length
without rewriting it.

Hello.  This isn't a bug in Pine; it's a bug in your Solaris C compiler
environment.  Solaris gleefully permits you to compile programs as SVR4 
software, but link them with the BSD libraries -- all with absolutely no 
indication to you that this has happened!

We've tried zillions of things, but what works for some people doesn't 
work for others.

Inserting -lc in the LDFLAGS of the pine/imap/imapd Makefile is one 
workaround that seems to work for many people.

Or, you can just use the pre-built binary from ftp.cac.washington.edu, 
file pine/unix-bin/imapd-bin.solaris .  We test the Solaris binaries to 
be sure they built right before putting them on the FTP server (or at 
least, we do now that we're aware of the problem).

*I* like that idea; I've always objected to calling following up
"replying" -- it's not replying, it's following up.  But the Pine authors 
want to treat news and mail as similarly as possible.

Also, the Pine authors anguished over changing the print keystroke to ^Y; 
there's no way they're going to change the send/post keystroke.

I think that Pine's antisocial behavior can be corrected without making
the users learn new keystrokes.  All that is needed is to figure out a
better way to tell whether a message/article is from mail or news than the
existence of a Newsgroups header.  Pine 3.92 is supposed to have
improvements in this area.

This could be a problem with my PC but I need to know for sure

message:

Bug in pine detected: "out of free storage"
Exiting pine

pcpine for LWP used.

My setup:
DOS 6.2, LWP on IBM token-ring card (4 mbps). LWP functioning well.

seems to contact IMAP server ( asks for password), then quits with the 
above message.

Suggestions (even if trivial) are welcome.

case 2:

The above setup does not work with packet driver setup using an 
ibmtoken.exe. The configuration works fine for CUTCP utilities. pcpine 
cannot find imap server. Please suggest

Pine does not *automatically* subscribe you to any newsgroups (unless, of 
course, your local system administrator has *substantially* changed the 
Pine program :-)

However Pine *does* use the same ".newsrc" file that other newsreaders 
use.  It is quite possible that you have used some other newsreader in 
the past which has automatically subscribed you to all the groups.

In fact I know from experience that this can happen accidentally:

Whilst Pine is our preferred/recommended mailer and news reader here we 
also provide (unsupported) Tin.  When Tin starts up for the first time it 
sends a "list subscriptions" command to the news server for a list of the 
newsgroups to automatically subscribe you to.  Unfortunately if the news 
server does not support this command you get an error.  Tin ends up 
subscribing you to ALL the newsgroups.  Sigh.

Anyway, the easiest way to unsubscribe from *everything* is to delete the 
file called ".newsrc" in your login directory (I'm assuming you're using 
a UNIX system).

Don't worry if you can't see this file when you give an "ls" command (Unix
normally hides files whose names start with a ".");  give the command "ls
-a" to see *all* the files and you should then spot the ".newsrc" file.

You don't.

Pine is a program for reading electronic mail that has been sent to you.  
It can also be used for reading Usenet News articles and also posting 
your own to the Usenet News system.

Pine is not a World-Wide Web browser (a thing which lets you view pages 
from the Web), nor is it an editor (which you normally use to create such 
pages yourself).

You should probably be using an editor to create your Web pages, and 
check them using a Web Browser such as Mosaic or Netscape (for X 
workstations, micros, etc) or Lynx (terminal screen based without the 
fancy graphics).

If you need more help try asking in the comp.infosystems.users Usenet 
News group.

I wonder why you would say this.  I read news offline and post follow
ups offline -- Does what you say apply to me? If it does, then I will
not be inclined to do anything different because no one has said
anything that explains what you say applying to me.

Unless I missed a message I think Terry missed out one important thing...

To tell Pine you have seen (finished with) a news article use the "D" 
command to "delete" it, just as you would an ordinary e-mail message.

Because news articles are actually held on a read-only server this 
doesn't *really* delete the article, but simply excludes it from the 
index shown to you.  (It also gets noted in your ".newsrc" file for 
future use by Pine and other news readers.)  You can see the entire list 
of available messages again by using the "Unexclude" command (&).

If you have the "news-approximates-new-status" option set in the Setup 
Configuration screen then Pine endeavours to add "extra value" be deciding 
whether undeleted messages have been seen or not (the latter being 
flagged as "New" with an "N" in the index screen).

This ios done by looking at the highest numbered deleted article.  Pine 
then *assumes* that previous (lower numbered) articles you have already 
read but not deleted and so shows them with " " status.  Higher numbered 
articles it assumes are newly delivered, and so marks with an "N".

This *is* a guess (hence the "approximates").  Pine has only one bit 
available to it to store three possible states (an impossibility, hence 
the guesswork).  This is because most newsreaders have only "New & 
included in index" and "Seen & excluded from index" message states, as 
against Pine's three: "New & included in index", "Seen & included in 
index", "Seen & excluded from index".

This is because of the Pine Team's idea that news articles should *not*
automatically disappear from the index once they are read.  Instead the
user must take some deliberate action to exclude it.  I think they have a
good idea here; I have found the "read once and it's gone"  approach of
other news readers to be their most confusing attribute (both personally
and in others). 

So the upshot is simply to use the D command to "delete" each article 
when you have finished with it.

You'll probably ask this at some point next, so here's a pre-emptive 
answer...

You can mark all the articles in a newsgroup as "seen" (deleted) by first 
using the Select command (;) to choose them All (A), then Apply (A) a 
Delete command (D) to them.  That is, type ;AAD

Note that for the Select and Apply command to be available you must have 
the "enable-aggregate-command" option set in the Setup Configuration screen.

Hi folks,

    Althought this is my first message to pine-info, I've been a
long-time user of Pine.  Pine 3.91 finally convinced me it was okay to
toss out Elm.  ;-)

    I grabbed the entire pine-info archive on the FTP site and noticed
a few people were having problems compiling or running Pine on a
FreeBSD machine.  I'm running the 950210 snapshot of FreeBSD 2.0 and
Pine 3.91 compiles and runs very nicely with only a couple of tweaks
and building it as BSD/OS ("build bsi").

    My mail comes in through two remote IMAP servers (one down the
road and the other on the other side of the globe) and news is through
a local NNTP server.  Reading/sending/posting messages all work
properly AFAIK.  If there are any other FreeBSD folks out there having
problems, post about it and I'll try to reproduce/fix them.

Subject: Problems compiling pine 3.91 with gcc on Sol 2.3.
Date: Mon, 13 Mar 95 16:21:19 GMT
Message-Id: <3k1rso$3lh@cwis-20.wayne.edu>

I just got done compiling pine 3.91 using gcc on Sol 2.3. This was one of
the biggest pains I've been through! First of all, none of the makefiles, or the
build script was set up for gcc, so I had to make many changes to get it to
compile. Second, the source code has hard code path locations (/usr/local/...)
all over the place, and we install code in locations other than in /usr/local, so I
had to make changes for that.

I've been installing programs for Unix for about 6 years now,  and I've never
had to make so many changes to makefiles and source code as I did with pine!
There isn't any reason why pine has to have these problems! gcc is a popular
cc compiler, so I don't know why it wasn't set up for it. And why would anyone
hard code path locations in a program?

pine is nice, but I'm not sure if it is worth all of the problems (when new versions
come out). If anyone is thinking about making any new changes to pine, I would
suggest making it more portable. Maybe using Configure or IMakefiles and removing
the hard coded path locations.

Well... I've been futzing around for a day or so and am prolly
missing something real obvious here, but below is a log of what 
happens with addrbook.c when I try to compile Pine.  Our system is
running solaris 2.4.

Anyone out there who might be able to lend an idea as to what I'm
doing wrong?

    Have you tried building TeX/LaTeX2e/xdvi/dvips with the kpathsea
library from scratch yet?  ;-)

    Pine should stick with a top-level Makefile that passes CC,
CFLAGS, LDFLAGS, etc. down to the lower Makefiles.  Making a single
change in ./Makefile then propagates down to imapd, pico, pine, etc.

    Examples?  I grepped through *.[ch] in the pine/ subdirectory and
didn't find any occurrences of "/usr/local" that specified a pathname,
except in os.h.  There are four hits in helptext.c and two in init.c,
none of which affect where Pine looks for support files.

    I might compile 3.91 on our Solaris 2.4 system some time soon, if
the real admin doesn't get around to updating it from 3.89.  I'll post
about any problems I encounter.

Take a look at the help page by selecting help on feature: 
enable-incoming-folders: (an excerpt)

NOTE: Pine does not do "delivery filtering"; this is the province of other
programs such as "filter" or "procmail".  Pine's Incoming Message Folders
collection provides a convenient way to access multiple incoming folders,
once they are created by other programs.  It is also useful if you have
accounts on multiple computers. 

Some of the other more experienced piners might care to comment...

Try using the Bounce command (you may need to enable this feature first) 
then from within the inbox message listing type B.

I agree.. I vote for a Macintosh version of Pine... a
PowerPC native Pine would be neat too!

love it and want to make it avaiable to all our users. However, we do not 
want them to have access to the setup/config option from the main menu. 
We are looking for a way to keep our regualr users out of this option, 
but yet leave it open for us system administrators. I might add that we 
are rather new to AIX, at the upper Novice level. Any help that we could 
get to solve this challenge would be appreciated.

    How on earth would one benefit from a native PPC version of Pine?
MIME messages don't take *that* long to decode!  :)

For Windows, there is Embla (formerly known as PC-MM), by ICL Pro Systems
in Sweden (Linkoeping). I think they're getting ready to move it to the 
U.S. market now (or have done just recently).

I've used it in v1.0. I think it's good, but it had some v1.0-ish 
"features" ;). Don't know what's happened when they renamed it, but 
if some of the bugs are gone, it might be a real nice reader.

I think you might find info if you mail a request to info@li.icl.se.
Hope the e-mail address works ...

Message-Id: <3k66ii$g6g@hpscit.sc.hp.com>

Hi:

I am using Pine 3.91 on HP-UX 712/9.05. Whenever I send a mail to multiple 
addresses, for eg., 
	To: someone@some.where, someone@some.where
my sendmail daemon complains that it is under POSSIBLE ATTACK - "there is a
newline in strings "someone@some.where,     someone@some.where". 
The sendmail log file does n't show a newline between the addresses.
BTW, this is happening after installing latest sendmail patch from HP.

Does anyone faced this problem before? Any clues what is really happening 
and a possible solution.


Thanks in advance,

Best regards,
- sreeni

Raymond,

If you set "character-set=ISO-8859-1" in your .pinerc file and assuming your
terminal or comm software supports ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) characters, Pine will
accept the accented characters.  Note that the recipients of your mail will
need MIME-aware mail readers... 

Thanks for the request!

One of my users, who was adding folders by ftp under Pine's nose (or 
behind its back!) would like a feature to refresh the list of folders 
without having to leave the folder list and reissue the L command. It 
would seem logical that ^L should do it.

Well, I just want more applications for PowerPC! :)

I like PowerPC Macintosh over all other systems.

Alas, no.  The religious issue *is* that News and mail commands should
be the same.

Suppose I have a high-powered Sun machine that gets, oh, 6 incoming
newsfeeds totalling a couple of hundred megs a day.  If I read or
post news on it, am I reading or posting offline?  (Probably not, you
might say.)

What if I cut it down to, say 2 incoming news feeds and 50 megs a day?

One incoming newsfeed and 3 megs a day?  A sporadic incoming newsfeed
that's rather selective based on my tastes, a couple of hundred
kbytes a day?

Just what is meant by offline news reading?

I don't know if you can prevent users from getting into the Setup .... 
however .... you can place entries in pine.conf.fixed which will prevent 
those entries from being overridden by individual users.

I guess you could make *every* entry a pine.conf.fixed entry!  So even if 
the user _did_ get into the setup ... he couldn't change anything!

However, one of Pine's targets was to be an easy to use & learn mail/news
reader for beginners. ( Since they've added aggregate commands, it's also
quite usable for non-beginners who get tons of mail. ) I have *yet* to see
a beginner who knew what "followup" is supposed to mean.  I get lot's of
questions about how to post messages in trn, as well as a few from those
who "reply" and then want to know why their message never got posted. 
They have often looked at the help screen, but since "followup" doesn't 
mean much to the non-computer literate: they skip right past that entry
until they see something that sounds suggestive (in plain English) of 
what they want: "reply". 

You're 100% correct in maintaining that distinction in Usenet-English,
but Pine's "misuse" of the language is one reason WHY I steer the confused
newbie's to it. They find it a much less frustrating tool.

Since Rahul's Rules seem to get more baroque and complicated with
each post ( I waiting for him to outlaw laptops, next! :-), I don't
think I have to argue further. He will eventually supply his own
reductio ad absurdum.

PLACE YOUR PERSONAL AD THROUGHOUT THE UKRAINE & WESTERN RUSSIA

Several months ago I placed a personal ad in the papers of the
Ukraine.  Following a two week run, I received letters and
photos from 25 SWF between the ages of 21 and 29.

I have purchased addresses through Family Intl as well as
other matchmaking companies and have found better success
meeting women through my own personal advertisement.

Olga Kosmina is willing to post your personal ad as she did
for me. She asks $50 for which your ad will run 2 weeks in
such publications as Viso Express throughout the Ukraine as
well as areas of western Russia.

Olga does not have e-mail, but you may reach her by sending a
letter of inquiry or if you wish, $50 and your personal ad to:

Olga Kozmina
Dekabristov Str, 5 - 178
Kiev 253121
Ukraine 

Olga is an honest woman, has my complete trust and has asked
that I post this advertisement for her business.  I am not
leaving my e-mail address because of the flames and revocation
of my account for having posted this.

Best Wishes,

George and Olga

Just goes to show you how much I've been skimming these messages. 

I was under the impression this whole time that the problem was that Pine
treated email with a Newsgroups: header as a potential news posting, and
that the makers of Pine didn't want to change the current behavior of the
program, asking someone if they wanted to post to a newsgroup a message
that came in via email and was intended to be an email in reply. 

I had not realized when I wrote the email that the makers of Pine had 
already decided that a different news-posting keystroke was out of the 
question. It seems that they are putting the "news is the same thing as 
email" philosophy ahead of everything else, even at the expense of making 
it confusing as to whether your message will be read by one or 
potentially millions. This would appear to go against the "easy for the 
newbie" philosophy, wouldn't it?

I personally think of news and email as two almost completely separate 
entities. I realize I am in the minority on this one, but hey. I used 
Pine as a newsreader at my school account, and I found that it made 
navigating around much more confusing, and I consider myself to be a 
reasonably experienced email and news user, having been doing both for 
over five years. 

Here's another (partial) solution: 

Put the newsgroups you are posting to in the To: line in the user
interface, and then move them to the Newsgroups: line behind the scenes
after the user hits Ctrl-X. When a user replies to a message and there are
entries in the Newsgroups: line, ask the user before they start typing if
they want to post to those groups. The behavior of "F" and "R" in the
newsgroup area would be identical, except that "F" would put the
newsgroups in the To: line. 

I realize this sounds silly at first, but think about it. I won't do 
another scenario-by-scenario rundown on paper, but I think everything's 
covered here. You could even perpetuate the Newsgroups: header in email 
in this scenario, if you desired. *ducks rotten vegetables* The fact that 
the newsgroups are in the To: line make them much more visible, I think.

There is still the danger of a user ignoring the pre-reply question, not 
realizing that the newsgroup is in the To: line, and misinterpreting the 
post-reply question, but I think this might cut down on that a little 
bit, and it preserves the Ctrl-X keystroke.

    If your posted articles are not injected into the news stream ASAP
after posting, but are spooled to disk for later transmission (e.g.,
because you do not have a permanent TCP/IP connection), then I would
say you are reading offline.

The attached email was unsoliciated, since I posted to Usenet and did

(I will address the actual issue in comp.mail.pine.)

    Full agreement here.  "Followup" simply isn't obvious or intuitive
to Usenet novices.  "Reply" makes far more sense.  I had written a
mail/news reader a few years ago that could distinguish between e-mail
and a Usenet posting.  I stuck with the rRfF convention introduced by
rn.  One suggestion I heard often from my users was a single command
that would intelligently redirect a response to either mail or news
depending on the original message.  Of course, being the feature-crazy
programmer that I am, there were about 5 preference settings related
to that one feature.  ;-)

Just a note to say that I just compiled pine under 5.3, and all is fine
except that pine code expects "syslog.h" to be in /usr/include when it 
is in fact in /usr/include/sys.

Subject: defunct arrow keys
Date: 16 Mar 1995 00:07:16 GMT
Message-Id: <3k7vfk$26n@jaws.cs.hmc.edu>

I am running pine 3.91 on a decstation 5000 with ultrix and a number
of users login using pathworks (pain in the ...).  I find that I have
to set the environmental variable "set term=vt100" to get things to work
because pathworks leaves the terminal type defined as "network."

This makes things work fine for all but one user.  On his machine 
the arrow keys do not do anything.  I read the tech notes about this
(page 47 in the ps version), but do not really understand if there is 
a quick fix and how to proceed.  


Any suggestions would be helpful and appreciated.

Subject: pine or general mail wrapper
Date: 14 Mar 1995 20:19:45 GMT
Message-Id: <3k4tp1$821@news1.halcyon.com>

I often suspend pine and do other things and then accidentally type
`pine' at the unix prompt.  I want to write a pine wrapper that will
check to see if pine is already running and if it is just restart the
already active pine.  I'm thinking about using the `jobs' and `fg %n' 
commands but I wanted to find out if someone already has a great pine
wrapper that I could use as a starting point.  I'm also interested in
other mail wrappers that people use, e.g., for mail or elm.

Thanks much,
Nancy

To anyone who can help:

	I've been having problems when sending mail.  When I send mail, a 
few seconds later, it comes right back to me.  However, at least some of 
the mail IS getting through.  One of my friends is receiving the same 
mail that I am receiving back.  It's very strange.  What's up with that?  
How can I tell if my mail is being sent or not?  I would really 
appreciate some insight into this problem.

Subject: "Reply-To" Address Field?
Date: 16 Mar 1995 01:10:24 GMT
Message-Id: <3k8360$8p0@usc.edu>

I'm trying to use pine on my home PC running Linux to handle my mail.
However, I can't find anywhere how to set the "Reply-To" field in address
headers.  

Since my mail-address account is on another machine, I've used the
"Reply-To" header field to put the correct return address in my mail when
using emac's rmail.  I haven't found anywhere in Pine to set such a field,
and since the local user name is different than my mail address, the "From"
field has the wrong address.

How can I set a "Reply-To" field in Pine?

                Thanks,
                Ev

Accesing News files across a network is common.  I don't believe this
much affects the current debate.  (I personally happen to access files
via NFS, so my machine doesn't have any News spool area of its own
either.)

As I've noted in the past messages in this tread, Pine is "broken" in that
it does not bother to designate on its CREATED messages how it is treating
them. There would be much less finger pointing at it if it were to mark the
messages and articles that it creates as to if they are outgoing Email
Messages or Outgoing News Posts (including if the fact that this is a dual
Email/News set and if the original copy being replied to was from Email or
News). If it did this, then when it processes Incoming Email or News (that
was created by another Pine) it would be able to TELL if the message was
Email or News. This is not it GUESSING but it seeing a Header that was put
there to DOCUMENT how the message/article was created and thus delivered.
Doing this would reduce all the screaming that is going on as well as
allowing Pine to know how to process the information in the Newsgroup Header
(or the superseding Documentation type Header).

    Ah, I did not know that pine-info was gated to comp.mail.pine.
How does this work?  Does everything that show up in pine-info get
sent to comp.mail.pine, and vice-versa?  If so, then I'll unsubscribe
since I get the newsgroup anyway.  As for Dhesi, I'll answer him in

Consider the above. Collecting articles (using rn) in a file
and using a mail-reader (PINE 3.91 in this case).

BUTTTT... when I go to this file (i.e. folder or whatever)
all articles have been collected into one giant file/item!!!!


This happens randomly, but not always....

Does anybody know why does this happen?
Bad and/or incompatible headers?


Please no flame as why I use rn and not xrn/trn/tin/etc/etc....

Ok, now back to the original issue:

I would say that offline reading as defined above has no effect on the
argument.  In fact in the early days of Usenet, almost every user at
every site did offline News reading and posting.  Only with the coming
of dedicated connections and nntp protocol did people even begin to
make a distinction between 'offline' and 'online' reading.

So long as you have a logical view of some place being the 'News spool'
are and some place being an 'email folder', my argument stands.  Post
News in the News context, and do not post a News followup based on
email.  A News posting saved in an email folder is now akin to
email and should be treated as such.

Message-Id: <3k7405$pdq@pioneer.uspto.gov>

We have just installed Pine 3.91 on our network and we are trying to setup
the news option.  I have our nntp-server correct and since we are using
Unix, we should not have to define the smtp-server.  We are using sendmail
though.  When I bring up the folder list, the news-collection is there. 
When I select one of the news groups, Pine tells me it is trying to open the
news group and then I receive [421 SMTP connection went away].  What does
this mean?  Is there a error manual or something for Pine?  Any help is
greatly appreciated.

Thanks!

Message-Id: <3k875i$5fr@news.sas.ab.ca>

I subscribed to a digest mode of a mailing list.  When I get the digest 
it says that it contains quite a large file, but I can't find it.  If I 
use "v" it says that there are no attachments to view, only the body.  I 
have contacted the list and asked them to respond to me privately 
(because obviously I can't read the list) and I can't get a response.
Any ideas would be appreciated since I am really new at this.

Hello.  I have a question concerning pine391.  How does one send
multiple carbon copies?

Thanks in advance.

Talking about that: Is there any mail reader that supports all MIME types

work without a POP account? Enlighten me :-)

I have a similar problem in that when a message of that magnitude is 
in the INBOX pine hangs while building the index. Does anyone have any 
suggestions?

I am new to this list and hope this is not a FAQ. I did look around in the
Pine home page, the FAQ page and the pine-info archive and didn't see
anything.

It is my understanding that e-mail of that size is frowned upon; although 
I have successfully sent 2MB+ files before being politely warned.

What you can do is to split (UNIX split command) the file into bite-sized 
pieces (200K or so) and email each in a separate message.  I just ran
  split filename.ext
Results in 
  xaa   285k
  xab   160k
Since the orignal file was about 445k.  You can specify the output file 
names and max size, but I didn't look that up.  Check the man page for 
more info.

The recipient will have to save each file and recombine using cat:

  cat x?? > filename.ext

Be sure to minimize your problem by first zipping, gzipping, compressing, or
otherwise making the file as small as possible.  There are probably easier
ways, but this will solve your problem for now.

Subject: INBOX Refresh

I'd like to keep Pine up and running in a window while at my
workstation.  I notice that there is a lag between the time I get
new mail and the time Pine refreshes the inbox.  How to I
increase the refresh rate?  Is this an option?  If so, where
do I set it from?  I've looked in the help and on the web but
can't find anything that addresses refresh of the INBOX.

Thanks in advance for any help,
David

That's a good point. However, my problem is with *receiving* such files
and the resulting hangup in displaying the index. My organization
routinely gets large, unsolicited mail messages as part of our journal
publishing operation. It wouldn't be practical to ask the senders to split
their files. 

The standard Unix mail programs (e.g. ucb/mail or its System V workalike
mailx) seem to work but we would much rather use pine. Is there anything
that can be done to improve pine's handling of large incoming messages? 

Thanks,
Pete.

This might be due to a bug in Pine 3.91.  Apply the attached patch and
rebuild Pine to see if that is the problem...

Message-Id: <3ka6jl$14k@jaws.cs.hmc.edu>


I am just now trying to turn on the news capability of
Pine, and have done so by just providing the nntp
address.
On one machine, where pine has been running fine, this worked.
On another machine, where pine has been running fine, this
did not.

I get the message:
        [ ** Empty List **  Select Here to Try Re-Expanding ]
when trying to list the news groups.

both machines are using the same server, both are running 3.91.

The debug file reads:
    ---- FOLDER SCREEN ----
IMAP 12:7 3/16 mm_log babble: news.claremont.edu InterNetNews NNRP server INN 1.
4 20-Mar-93 ready (posting ok).

ANY HELP WOULD BE APPRECIATED.  THANKS

Subject: Environment variables in .pinerc 3.91
Message-Id: <D5JHqK.MBo@news.cern.ch>
Date: Thu, 16 Mar 1995 15:30:19 GMT

We've recently moved from pine 3.89 to pine 3.91. Some 50 people are using 
their old .pinerc files, in which there is a line like

printer=a2ps -p -F10 -ns -f -Hmail | lpr -P"$PRINTER" -l -Jmail    

This was working fine with 3.89 running under AIX 3.2.5 on RS/6000 machines.
With 3.91, however, the double quotes surrounding environment variables are
interpreted differently, as is shown by the response on the prYnt
command:

Print message 1 using command "a2ps -p -F10 -ns -f -H"mail" | lpr -P" -l -Jmail -?

Is this a bug or a feature?

Don't ask why, but I spend a great deal of time reading mail through
a connection over which I cannot send a ^X.  I would like to start using
pine, however I would also like to continue to be able to "send" mail ;)

I've been looking through the source and I can't seem to find where the
keys for that area are mapped.

Can anyone give me a hint as to what part of the source to look at?
(or any other fix to my problem)


Thanks,

MAYBE the pine version using function keys would be useful (I read it=20
does exist---consult the pine manual). I think there will surely be a=20
function key equivalent of ^X in it.

Wish you'll be successful.

Hi,  I used to have the same problem.  it all depends on your connection 
to the machine running pine (in my opinion).  for example, I was dialing 
into a Xyplex terminal server then telnet'ing to my Unix box.  I had to 
give the following commands at the Xyplex end before I telnet'ed over to 
the Unix workstation:

Xyplex> set port ansi
Xyplex> set telnet type signal request disabled

or something like that.  apparently the Ctrl-X and some others were being 
stripped out by the Xyplex until I issued those "set" commands.  use the 
"help" feature on the Xyplex to get more info on that second set command 
since I'm not exactly sure how it goes.

You have to trick elm utilities into considering new mail to be new in folders
other than the default system spool mailbox.
You can do this by adding a fake "Status:" field to every incoming mail
before filing it.

This is absolutely wonderful, no sarcasm intended.  

Let them send private replies until they are no longer beginners.  Let
us not make it too easy for people to post something that will be
propagated around the world.

No person who has not yet read enough of the manuals, or read enough of
the postings in news.announce.newusers and news.answers, or otherwise
acquired a knowledge of Usenet, to understand followups, should be
posting to Usenet.

When 'T'aking a name from the inbox, and attempting to add it to a
distribution list (I tried with an empty list and a non-empty list), Pine
gives an "Error updating addressbook: Pine Bug" message.  

It asked me if I wanted to replace the list with the address taken from the
inbox.  Ideally, IMHO, Pine should either automatically add the name to the
list, or present an option to do so.  The error occurred after I indicated
that Pine was to replace the list with the new name, and I accepted the
default values for the ensuing prompts.  The message appeared at the point
where Pine usually adds the name to the addressbook and writes it out to
disk.

Sorry if this bug has been reported before -- I've been less than religious
in reading the mailing list.

Hello, everyone.

Somewhere in pine's documentation, I read that one could customize 
pine's behavior so that it could automatically place email in a particular
folder based on that letter's address.  Can someone please direct me
to the section of the docs that discusses that feature?

Thanks for all help.

Yes, there is a gateway between the pine-info@cac.washington.edu mailing list
and the comp.mail.pine newsgroup.  It is operated at psg.com and managed by
Randy Bush <randy@psg.com>.  Specific questions about the gateway should be

Pine handles MIME pretty much transparently.  You don't need to configure
anything unless you want to set up viewers for special MIME types, etc.

In Pine 3.91, go to the Setup/config screen, find "customized-hdrs" and Add
"Reply-To:  Everitt Beers <ebeers@nunki.usc.edu>".

Subject: Remote IMAP, Passwords
Date: 16 Mar 1995 21:24:41 -0500
Message-Id: <3kart9$rgv@tusk.lm.com>

I'd like to use pine on a computer system at work to access mail
received at my personal account at a local ISP.  I use Eudora from
my Mac at home to retrieve mail from the IMAP server at the ISP, so
I'm sure the ISP end is OK.

I think I have .pinerc configured to access that IMAP server at my
ISP.  I think my problem is that I'm unable to set the password I need
to access the remote IMAP server.  When I try to use the pine new
password command, pine asks me for the old password.  I haven't the
foggiest idea what the password value is!  The only password that
matters at Transarc is the Kerberos password, but I doubt that this is
what is being checked by pine.  I haven't used the UNIX 'passwd'
command in years.  In any case, I don't want to use the same password
at work and at the ISP.

So, where does pine look for the password?  How do I set it if I can't
provide the old value?  The /etc/passwd entry on the system where I
ran pine has "!", which probably means look somewhere else.

Thanks,

Hi friends,
As you know, "spell" is a proprietary software of AT&T and one
can not get it freely. So far I find pine or pico only
recognize spell. Ispell is free and much better than spell,
if you know how to make pine/pico work under ispell please
help. Thanks.

Barry misunderstood you.  You weren't going to send out UK-ASCII.  But
you could send out ISO-646-GB which is the MIME label (RFC 1700) for
that old British standard 4730.  My users would be able to read that.

Does anyone has a such tool?  Please respond to dyc@eng.stratus.com.

Firstly create a file in your home directory ( ~/ ) on my unix account called 
.signature.   Then write whatever signature you want in it.... then save the 
file.

Secondly edit .pinerc and make sure that the part where it says:
# signature-file specifies the name or path of a file containing text that
# will automatically be inserted in outgoing mail.
signature-file=.signature
looks like this

The save .pinerc.  This should work  on unix.  I don't know about PC pine.

Subject: Anyone get PINE to work with DG210 terminals?
Date: 17 Mar 1995 05:28:30 GMT
Message-Id: <3kb6lu$iig@mack.rt66.com>

We have a lot of people using Data General DG210 terminals.  While
these terminals are not the best, they do have a fairly complete
command set.  I have several curses based programs which run just fine
on these dinosours.  PINE, however, makes a mess of the screen.

These are being driven by a Solaris 2.4 machine, so I am using
terminfo.  Anyone have a patch for PINE which will clean up the mess?

Thanks,

Someone told me I can use procmail to filter mail into PINE, but I'm too
dumb to figure it out on my own.  My problem is simple.  I'm on a mailing
list (call it MAILLIST) and I want to get all mail that has MAILLIST in
the To: or CC: line to get deposited in a folder called MAIL.  How to? 
Any instructions (or example files) highly appreciated.

Patrick, I could send you the terminfo source files for the d210 and 
d210-dg if you think that might help.

	If you use PINE 3.91, you can add "Cc: whoever" to your 
Customized-hdrs: and it should do what you're looking for.

[This is being sent to the pine-info mailing list, as well as the zmailer
discussion list.  The former is gatewayed to comp.mail.pine, the latter
is mail-only.  If readers of either list by mail follow-up, both lists
should be included; however, those who read comp.mail.pine and choose to
follow-up will fail to have their comments seen by the zmailer group
unless a copy is sent to <zmailer@cs.toronto.edu> as well.  Just a warning.

    Here are the details of my setup:
Zmailer is running as MTA on the machine ccsun.tuke.sk.  I have a
mailbox there, and prefer to receive my mail there.
I access this mailbox with a client connected to the IMAP server running
on ccsun.tuke.sk.  My client, Pine, is on a different machine in a
completely different domain.

    Mail sent from Pine on ccsun receives a fully-qualified domain name
automagically, so it is handed to zmailer as <barryb@ccsun.tuke.sk>, for
example.
    Zmailer rewrites the fully-qualified sender's name, if delivery is
done locally, with only the login.  In other words, the mail in the
spool looks just like this, in part:

From:	Kamil Kukura <kamk>
To:	Kevin Mitnick <Barry.Bouwsma@tuke.sk>
Message-ID: <Pine.SUN.3.91.950313204123.6074A-100000@ccsun.tuke.sk>

    What happens is that I read this mail spool via IMAP and reply from
the host more local to me.  Here I quote from a message I sent out...

> My IMAP client gave this... To: Kamil Kukura <kamk@cap1.capaccess.org>

    As Pine users know, Pine will append the domain name to any logins
to create a complete e-mail address.  But here it fails spectacularly,
as the login on the mail which has the appearance of being local, really
appeared on a different machine, with different domain name.

    Given that zmailer is delivering mail in this rather distributed
environment, my feeling is that what it should be doing (and what any
MTA should be doing), given the increased use of remote protocols such
as IMAP to read mail, is not reducing e-mail addresses to the bare
minimum, with the resulting ambiguity, but rather, the MTA should
instead always be completing incomplete e-mail addresses.  Comments?

    It is noted in the Pine tech notes that using e-mail addresses that
are not complete is a source of all sorts of problems, like this one. 
Is it possible to configure zmailer to leave e-mail addresses alone if
they arrive in full from the local machine?  Should this be the default
configuration?

    Another possibility would be for the IMAP server to complete
addresses such as this if found in a header when serving the mail to the
remote client.  How desirable is this?  (The presence of an incomplete
address saved from a client on one machine to a folder on a different
server is one case where this would fail.)

    I'm posting this to both groups to get comments from all who use
either program, even though I think that there are other mailers and
MTAs which use only a login for address, and fail to append a full
hostname to it, and the MTA also fails to append a hostname.  The
configuration of v8 sendmail here leaves <login> in the To: field, when
sent without attached hostname, so this sort of problem extends beyond
zmailer, perhaps needing attention from the IMAP server as well...
Maybe the default sendmail configuration should be to always add the
hostname to those addresses lacking one, as well...

    Comments and discussions about the best solution, or combination of
solutions, to this problem, are encouraged...

Help....

I'd like to do "mass mailings," but using BCC field will display the
reciepients of all BCC entries... is there a "correct" way to do mass
mailings so that a BCC person cannot see that mail is sent to
another BCC person?

Yes, I am using a UNIX system, but is it OK to outright DELETE the file?
Is the file not required to have access to newsgroups? Is the file then
re-created? I know, lots of questions...i'm a curious George.

Here's one more question, how do I ensure that I have access to NEW
newsgroups each day (or however often...)? Are they added to my .newsrc
file? If so, how? Any answers to these questions would be much appreciated
as I'm trying to learn everything I can during my short stay on earth.

Thanx

I'm interested in getting a GUI version of PINE for MS- and X-Windows.  I
wondered if anyone out there has worked on the beginnings of this or
has any design plans and such to go by.  

Also:  I've been having some problems getting PINE to compile for AIX-3.2.5,
and wondered if anyone has an updated makefile.* for this OS.

Thank you... (please respond via email)

Not necessarily.  I generate my own message ids (this message has message id
<19950317161032.olly@mantis.co.uk>).  I do this so I can use strn's score
files to pick out follow-ups to my posts (by looking at the References:) and
distinguish them from follow-ups to other mantis posts.

So I could easily reference future messages if I actually wanted to.  I
could send a large message in several chunks, such that each message
references all the others.

More relevantly, 1036 References are tree-like (due to the way they are
generated), whereas 822 References can cross-link or do anything else.  In
reality, all the References: lines I've seen on e-mail are valid by RFC-1036
too (I'm working on a threading mail-to-news script, so I've been looking
carefully).

    I can't say for sure about ISO Latin-1 support with CP850.  I do know
that I chose to run PC-Pine as a batch file which first loaded an ISO 8859-2
code page on the PC (this was in Slovakia and Czechia), then ran Pine, then
restored the original code page, so no translation was needed.  I'm pretty
sure the support for Latin-2 and PC code pages is not there, though (please
correct me if I'm wrong).

Message-Id: <D5L5AH.8tu@news2.new-york.net>


my usual way to get news is via nntp to my providers news server.  in
addition I've setup local usenet for a handfull of news groups. to
workaround the the fact the news item numbers are different for the local
spool version, I chnaged the tin program to look for .lnwsrc as its
subscription file (instead of .newsrc). I dont know if pine uses that file
to determine what articles to display as unread.  I called the new tin ltin
vs tin which is really rtin (nntp). 

what do I need to put into the pine.conf file to have pine see the local
news spool as a news source (/usr/spool/news/...)? And can it be told to
look for .lnwsrc vs .newsrc so both the remote and local servers will
continue to work correctly.

Thanks for making that clear.  I was trying to provoke someone

This would represent a valuable facility in some situations, in the
sense that the recipient cannot control the sender's choice of
code, and must make do with what they've received.
 
In my previous posting I had drafted a question asking how _PC_ Pine
(which I don't use and am not familiar with) deals with the PC character
set(s), but then I took it out again, thinking that this could be a
topic of its own...

MS Kermit (the last I looked at it) did indeed seem to support more
code pages and characters than most other terminal emulations added
together.

Quite so.

In a previous article, FLAVELL@cernvm.cern.ch (Alan J Flavell) says:

    To avoid further misunderstanding, let me point out that Pine
has no routines for translating a particular character set as defined
in incoming mail, or outgoing mail for that matter, to a different
character set of a display device.  Pine simply passes through all
data as the 8-bit characters they are.

    It would be nice if one could configure the display charset and the
trnasport (mail) character set differently, but that would add quite a
bit of extra code and tables to translate from one charset to another.

    In other words, with Pine, the only way to see the correct characters
that are intended to be sent is for the sending device to match the
display device.  (Probably PC-Pine has some translation, unless I'm
thinking of Kermit which supports a variety of code pages and charsets.)

    The charsets that should be used for mail, and thus those for which
Pine should be configured, are outlined in RFC1700, although use of
regional variants of ISO 646 is deprecated in favor of ISO 8859-1 which
covers a wide variety of western European languages.

    If your character set doesn't match that with which the mail was set,
you'll see some characters wrong -- like the British pound for the US
$ dollar sign with your UK-ASCII, or the currency symbol (sorta a cross
between o and x) on the otherwise-US-ASCII Tesla VT100 clones I used in
Slovakia.  Anyone want to volunteer to write code to perform translation
from a mail MIME charset to a different display charset?  It would be
very useful...


>Well, I now discover that if I consult PINE's online help
>information for its character code parameter, it talks exclusively

    Pine uses the character set you define in the configuration to tag
the message for the recipient.  When you receive mail with a different
tagging, Pine cautions you that some characters may be different, but
goes ahead and passes the characters to your display.  It would be up
to you, if possible, to change your charset to match that specified in
the incoming mail, which is relatively easy to do if running X with an
escape sequence.

    Any volunteers to write code to send X sequences to change the font
used when differently tagged mail comes in?  There are a variety of
MIME-useful charset fonts available from
ftp://ftp.vszbr.cz/pub/X11-fonts/   or
ftp://ccsun.tuke.sk/pub/font-archive/X11/
for people running X desiring support for additional languages...

Considering that message-ids are generated by the system when a message
is sent, it is impossible for a mail references header to contain the
ids of messages that aren't older than the mail the header is in.

You said they weren't important to you. You didn't say whether you were
speaking as a developer or a user. All I said was, to you, in whatever
mode you were speaking, there was no difference (that is what you
said), and that that lack of difference didn't necessarily apply to
anyone but you.

>That I can ignore the difference?  

If you are not writing software that other people are going to use, feel
free to ignore whatever the hell you want. If you are writing tools for
other people, then pay attention to what those people are telling you
about how they want the tools to work.

Subject: attached files forced into Mime?
Message-Id: <morrisaD5Lno2.E7x@netcom.com>
Date: Fri, 17 Mar 1995 19:33:38 GMT

I'd appreciate any help with the following problem.
I've RTFM (maybe just not the right spots), and continue to have a 
problem attaching readable files to email sent with Pine.

I uuencode a file, enter pine, and attach the uuencoded file.  
However, the files are reaching the destination as mime encoded, 
and are not readable with a simple uudecode.  

I'm using Pine 3.91.  I've been able to grab and uudecode files sent to 
me with no problem, but since several recipients have been unable to 
uudecode files I've attached I need to do something differently.

Thanks for any help,

Alan Morris

You could start pine with "pine -k" and then
use the [F3] key to send mail.

First off,
Thanks to all you who send me suggestions on how to fix this.  In the
end, the best solution? Use gcc and use the -traditional switch and
remove the -ansi one in pine/makefile.sol, this took care of everything.
(OH yeah... and add -DSYSTYPE to that line also as it was left out).

Someone sent patches for me to use, but just using -traditional and gcc
seemed to work much better :).

Hope this helps some other people out there too!

I've noticed that pico reads in an entire file into memory. This is a
problem when you want to edit a huge file. On a UNIX system, for example,
a single user can cause serious performance degredation by pico-ing a file
that pushes the system into a high paging rate. 

[our users are so comfortable with pico via pine, they've taken to using
pico as a standalone text editor]

Are there any plans to release a version of pico that doesn't read an
entire file into memory?

When you tell pine to 'attach' a file, it normally encodes it using
base-64 encoding.  So, in your case, the file ends up being encoded
twice:  First with uuencoding, then again with base-64 encoding.
Possible solutions (pick any one):

1. Ask the recipient to read the message with pine, save the attached
   file, then exit pine and uudecode the file.  (Or read with any mail
   reader that can decode MIME-encoded messages.)

2. Ask the recipient to pipe the message through 'metamail', which
   will send the base-64-decoded contents to standard output.  This
   should be directed to a file, and then uudecoded in a separate
   step.

3. When composing your message, don't ask pine to attach the file.  Instead,
   use the ^R key while composing the body of the message.  This will
   let you include the file in the body without encoding it further.
   Now the recipient can uudecode the message directly.

In a previous article, help@umabnet.ab.umd.edu (UMABnet Help Account) says:

>Is ^? used anywhere in pine or in pico?  How about in emacs?

    What do you mean, ``^?''  This pair of printable characters is how
the DELete character (decimal code 127), a non-printing character, is
represented by Unix, the way that a backspace (control-H) is represented
as ``^H''.  If you mean this, yes, in all three, they normally delete
the previous character.

    If you mean control-?, there is no such character.  There are 32
control characters, @, A-Z, [, \, ], ^, and _.  Some keyboards may
recognize the control key when used in combination with other keys,
like ? or numbers, but these are not ASCII control characters.

Hi, I would like to ask how I can send mail with Quoted-printable instead
of Base64 on pine. Whenever I send out a mail, it says the encoding as
base64 in headfile. Is there anyway that I can change the encoding as QP?
Thanks in advance,

Suppose I mail a text to a moderator to be posted in a newsgroup. I send 
someone a cc: The someone replies me and the reply contains a reference. 
Thereafter the moderator posts my email as news but does not generate a 
new msgid, instead he reuses the msgid of my email for the news.

I would say that then the reference refers to all copies of that text, 
the news copies as well as the email copies. Nevertheless the news was 
posted only after the reference.

This nonsense merits correction. 

I sent Mr. Crispin one piece of email, which was a response to mail he
sent to me. 

What Mr. Crispin is really complaining about, and complained to my admin
about, was the comp.mail.headers gateway to the headers-people mailing
list.  While Mr. Crispin chose to send personal copies of every article
he sent to that mailing list to me by mail directly, I did not choose
to have the gateway send him anything. (In fact, had there been a way to
tell the gateway to limit what Mr. Crispin received,I would have used
it. There was no such option. Mr. Crispin signed on to the mailing list
for a penny, he signed on for a pound. On the other side, Mr. Crispin
refused to stop choosing to send me the mail he was.)

Now, just what is the "submission" I am trying to force upon people? 

One thing. Open your world view to accept that there are people who do
not view mail and news and the same thing, and who do not use mail and
news for the same thing, and write the tools to allow the distinction to
be made. That is, simply, accept that "same thing" is not the only
viewpoint. Nobody is saying that you must accept "different" as the only
way, just accept it as A way. A tool that allows users to differentiate
can be used in non-differentiating mode, but the obverse is not true.

The argument "people don't believe news and mail are different" just
won't fly -- there are people here telling you they believe they are
different. How you want to treat them is your business. Just understand
that some people DON'T believe they are the same.

Don't ask why, but I spend a great deal of time reading mail through

I've been looking through the source and I can't seem to find where the

Can anyone give me a hint as to what part of the source to look at?

Look on ftp://ftp.cae.wisc.edu/hpux, where you will find a lot of

I suspect the problem is at netcom, since I dial in, use my computer as a

What should I tell them to change back the way it was before?

Yes, I understand the situation that is being discussed, but I'm
trying to point out that the problem A is complaining about is
in fact caused by A saying something he shouldn't have committed
electronically in the first place and by A including the Newsgroups:
header on his transmission.  Whatever B or his mail program does is
almost irrelevant to the issue.  I suspect that there are even
situations in certain places that would cause the bounce message
to be delivered to the newsgroup in the case where B's mailbox wasn't
even available. 

However I haven't really used Pine enough to comment on it's behaviour.
My impression is that such a program should have one command that
says "reply to sender only" whether in the context of news or mail
and another command that says "reply to everyone who saw this".  If
the user is giving the "reply to sender" command (or Pine doesn't
have such a command) and Pine is offering to post anyway, then I
agree that it is broken.  If it always uses a two-step command
where the user has to indicate he wants to reply, then give
another response as to where the reply should go, I'd say it is
more confusing than necessary, but probably not broken.

A couple of months ago, Rahul Dhesi did this same thing to the membership
of the header-people mailing list (the discussion group for RFC-822 email
implementors), which was once gatewayed to the comp.mail.headers mailing
list. 

After several weeks of his bullying, the gateway between header-people and
comp.mail.headers was broken in order to permit the normal business of
header-people to resume.  Dhesi is also expressly uninvited from
header-people. 

Is Dhesi now attempting to shut down the pine-info mailing list's gateway
with comp.mail.pine?  It is plain to see that Brian Tao did a normal
mailing list reply.  Brian did nothing to deserve this treatment.

I uploaded a file from Microsoft Word, and it showed up as a file
type of English text instead of ASCII text on our UNIX system.  When
I send this file, to others the TAB is translated to =09, CR/LF shows
up as =20, and the printer's quote is translated to =D5.  Is there
any way to turn off the translation of these characters when I send
the message?

Thanks for any suggestions.

Your assumption is both odd and presumptuous.  I rarely reply to a
posting "live".  It takes me too long to sort out my thoughts and craft
a reply.  I prefer to save _any_ interesting articles to a folder, and
then go back later and decide whether or not to do a follow-up.  My
only problem is this: I save to a pine folder, because that way I can
go back later and post, but pine assumes that I want to either email
_and_ post, or just email, whereas I usually want _only_ to post.  You
apparently assume that I should be allowed _only_ to post immediately,
in the heat of the moment, without any time for reflection.  I tend
to do that only when I run across something asinine enough to trigger
an immediate response, against my better judgement...like now.

I believe the situation here is a little more complicated:

   A sends private email to B.  The email does not have a cc header.
   It does have a Newsgroups header, which is a comment for the benefit
   of the human reader.

   B wishes to send a reply to A.  In the reply, B includes some of the
   private text from A's message.

   Mail program assigns semantics to the Newsgroups header, and asks if
   B wishes to post the response to Usenet.  B abesnt-mindedly answers
   Yes.

The loss of privacy occurs because A's text was included in B's
response.  Both people (strangers or not) *are* being kind to one
another, so that is not the issue here.  The issue here is the
accidental, not deliberate, loss of privacy, caused by a program asking
a question it should never have asked.

Actually, Pine is less ambitious since it does not do any translation. 
The character-set parameter tells Pine what to _assume_ the user's
terminal is set to use for a character set.  We may investigate some form
of translation capabilities in the future, but probably not for the next
release...

The only effect on incoming mail is to display a warning about potential
problems at the top of a message when the character-set parameter and the
charset in the message do not match...

None of the addresses should be passed on the Bcc:, but there are some
broken mail transports that will re-insert them.  Inserting a dummy To:

My boss asked me to try and track down a version of Pine that's been 
ported for use on VMS.  Where can I tell him to go (for the software, 
people.  Be nice.)?

You may find this hard to do while staying within pine.  I was not able
to make pine preserve its text buffer (into which ^K saves text) across
messages, i.e. the buffer is apparently emptied once you begin
composing a new message.  You should be able to put text in a file
before you invoke pine, then read it in with the ^R command into a
message being composed.  So a possible sequence is:

1. Invoke a text editor (e.g. pico) to put text in a file.  Save
   file and exit editor.
2. Invoke pine.  While composing a message, put the cursor in the
   body of the message and use the ^R command to read the file from step
   1 into the body of the message.

>Also how do I copy and paste from another text into a Pine document?

By 'pine document' did you mean a message being composed while using
pine?  If so, see step 2 above.

Sigh.  My preferred news server is acting up, so I'll have to see how

    Pine 3.92, which should be available in the not-too-distant future,
will allow you to send all these characters without translation if your
setup is configured to meet certain conditions.

    What you see is quoted-printable encoding, which is what Pine now
uses whenever it encounters a few non-ASCII characters in your message. 
In your case, your printer's quote with code 0xD5 is out of the range of
ASCII (characters 0-127 decimal or 0x00 to 0x7F).

    Quoted-printable encoding is intended to preserve characters which
often get munged by mail gateways.  The TAB character is sometimes lost
or converted to a space, which is why you see it as =09.  The =20 which
you see is not a newline, but a space character at the end of the line,
because some mail transport agents do not preserve this space.

    What has triggered Pine to use Q-P encoding is the character
represented as =D5, which in your case is the character for a printer's
quote, but in the ISO 8859-1 codeset, represents an O with tilde, or if
stripped to 7-bit ASCII, shows up as U.  (AHA!!!  That's why I see some
news posts with words such as donUt on this ASCII-only display I use...)
If you can avoid using 8-bit characters such as this, Pine will not
encode your message, so you should probably be using the ' apostrophe
instead.

    Being unfamiliar with Microsoft Word, I will leave it up to someone
else to explain how to either save a document so your character 0xD5 is
converted to the US-ASCII apostrophe, or to convert a MS Word document.

    If you are talking about a plain text message, Pine scans the
message to determine whether to encode it if there are 8-bit characters,
and if the number of 8-bit characters in the message is more than about
10%, as it is more efficient to use BASE64 encoding for these messages,
Pine chooses that.
    I trust you are using a character set other than US-ASCII for a
language other than English, relying heavily on 8-bit characters
(Russian and Hebrew are two quick examples in wide usage).

    If you are talking about attached text files, the Pine tech-notes
explains the reasoning for using BASE64 encoding.  If your text file you
are attaching is ASCII, in English, or a language which uses only a few
8-bit characters, you can ^R read the file into the body of your message
and it will not be BASE64'ed.

    Again, the next release of Pine will permit you to send 8-bit text
mail as 8-bit data, instead of relying on Q-P or BASE64 encoding, when
you speak to an ESMTP 8BITMIME server (a few examples are PMDF, zmailer,
and the upcoming BSD Sendmail v8.7).

    Also, ask your system administrator to fix your news or mail software.
This is what I got when trying to reply to you:

There's a free version from Hebrew Univ of Jerusalem (HUJI),

Conventional wisdom is that one becomes familiar with the discusion
thread before posting a follow-up.  Do you agree or disagree with
this?  Do think think it would be good advice to suggest to most users
that they first save selected postings, and then later follow up to
them outside the context of the discussion?

Paul, I am terribly new to Pine and have been looking around for a faq or 
news articles which might help me setup Pine to tie in with Usenet and my 
subscribed groups, so I can't respond to your question with experience.  
That said, I've been on Usenet and BBSes since 1983 and have come across 
all manner of offline reader software.  I don't know if that's what 
you're referring to.

For example, as a DOS user, I use programs commonly referred to as QWK 
mail.  Such software permits me to login to the net (or a BBS), execute a 
command which then automatically grabs all mail that I've pre designated 
(such as subscribed-to groups, personal email, conference mail, etc., 
latest bulletins, new uploaded files list, etc.).  All this is compressed 
into a pkzip format file with the extension .qwk, and is then uploaded to 
my computer and I logoff the net.

At that point I have a file, say, BIGNET.QWK, on my disk.  At my leisure, 
I then run my qwk program, it unpacks the BIGNET.QWK file and presents 
everything to me in a similar fashion as though I am online.  I can scan, 
browse, read, reply, etc.  I can do this as time permits as a bookmarking 
feature is built-in and keeps track of where I left off, etc.

My replies (you can tell the program which editor/word processor you want 
it to call up when you opt to write a reply) are all then collated by the 
program and it creates a file, say BIGNET.REP.  The next time I login to 
BIGNET, I can again execute the program or manually upload BIGNET.REP and 
all my replies will be automatically posted in their proper place.  I 
then log off and that's it.

Rather convenient and frankly the most convenient for me when I'm pressed 
for time.  Plenty such qwk programs are around as shareware, many flavors 
to chose from.  Bear in mind that if you have a 2400 modem and you have 
lots and lots of mail to download, it can take some time, same as 
downloading a 500k file, etc.  All depends on how much mail and/or how 
many active groups you subscribe to and how long between visits.  A once 
or twice daily routine should keep things quite manageable.

Again, if this is *not* what you're talking about, major apologies for 
telling you something you already know and my misunderstanding your 
post.  (If perchance you know how I can tie Pine into Usenet, I wouldn't 
mind an email on this.)

Regards, Bob

Curiosity leads to experimentation.  You could rename (mv) .newsrc to, 
say, newsrc-save or some such, then see what happens when you start.  
Your original is still around, so you can breathe easy, and you'll then know 
for sure what happens.  Don't be afraid of your computer/software.  Make 
back ups and tinker.

I've just put up a mail server and have a problem with Pine and
replys to messages.  I'm using Unixware, I don't know if that
is the problem.

when i reply to a message, pine fills in the name of the original
sender in the To: field like it should, but it adds MY domain 
address on to the end of the address.

Does anyone know how to stop this?

thank you.

Yes and the method depends on the mail that you want to Take Addre from.
If that mail has only one address, then choose method 1, if it has another
address either in Cc: or Reply-To use method 2.

Method -1:
First enable aggregate command set option, then hit ";" to select the current
mail whose address you want to Take, then hit A for apply, T to take address
and then follow Method -2.

Method -2:
Highlight the mail whose address you want to Take to an existing distribution
list, then hit T. It will take you into List Take Mode. Select the address that
you want and then T to take again and type in the nickname of the existing list
and then A to add to the list.

Message-Id: <3kie22$q2h@athena.rpl.regina.sk.ca>


Before I completely trash my existing .newsrc, I thought it would be 
prudent to at least ask for advice.  

The saga so far:  we have been transferring news to a local machine.  And 
we have local newsgroups on the same machine.  In the interest of saving 
hard drive space, and getting a complete set of news, we now have nntp 
access to an outside news provider.  I tested access using trn.  The 
first thing that happened was that all local groups were declared bogus 
and were marked unsubscribed.  Not nice.  

What we want to do is set up pine to access both machines as seperate 
news sources.  I can do that in the configuration.  But, before turning 
the masses loose, I need to find a way of avoiding each access to a 
seperate news source bogusing the newsgroups for the other source.  And, 
it has to be transparent to "joe user".  For myself, I have seperate 
.newsrc's on each machine - but joe user is limited to pine on one 
machine.  

My generic solution would be to have .newsrcmachine1 and .newsrcmachine2 
linked to news.machine1 and news.machine2 - the question is, can it be 
done?  Or, is there another way?  Or, are we simply out of luck?

So, this is exactly equivalent to someone sending you some private email
that accidentally includes some CC: headers, and then being surprised
when you reply to all.  If the original sender wants you to understand
that he is sending a private message he should make sure that the
headers don't contain extraneous CC:'s or Newsgroups: headers.

Not that it's any more productive, but you also see a fair amount of the
same posted intentionally to Usenet, so you can't rely on the content to
tip you off that a message was supposed to be private.  Trn may be the
usual culprit, since it includes the Newsgroups: header in a CC:'d
mail copy of a posting as well as in private replies.

The real message here is that anything you send electronically can
appear *anywhere* and be kept for any length of time.  If that bothers
you, don't send it in the first place.  In addition to the possibility
of accidents in transmission, you are relying on the kindness of
strangers as far as respecting your wishes for privacy goes.  Not
everyone agrees on the rules of etiquette, especially if something
appears threatening or illegal.

Empty List means you have _not_ subscribed to any newsgroups at all.
Try subscribing to any newsgroup and then that error message will go.

In comp.mail.pine, some queer sunspot activity fomented kersey black to pen:

 -  I am just now trying to turn on the news capability of
 -  Pine, and have done so by just providing the nntp
 -  address.
 -  On one machine, where pine has been running fine, this worked.
 -  On another machine, where pine has been running fine, this
 -  did not.

 -  I get the message:
 -          [ ** Empty List **  Select Here to Try Re-Expanding ]
 -  when trying to list the news groups.

 -  both machines are using the same server, both are running 3.91.

 -  The debug file reads:
 -      ---- FOLDER SCREEN ----
 -  IMAP 12:7 3/16 mm_log babble: news.claremont.edu InterNetNews NNRP server INN 1.
 -  4 20-Mar-93 ready (posting ok).

 -  ANY HELP WOULD BE APPRECIATED.  THANKS

In comp.mail.pine, some queer sunspot activity fomented Jim Gerland to pen:

 -  What is the syntax (if it's possible) to invoke PINE and have it
 -  go directly into a specific news group?

 -  To get to a particular mail folder I can use: pine -f name-of-folder
 -  but how would I do: pine -f name-of-news-group

pine -f "*{netnews.server.address/nntp}comp.mail.pine"

Replace netnews.server.address with the address of your newsserver
(nntp-server) and also the specifc newsgroup name...and then....
Bingo!

Subject: New Feature: Pine for 8 bit environment.
Date: 19 Mar 1995 23:36:00 GMT
Message-Id: <3kif50$q77@db.csie.ncu.edu.tw>


Hi, following patch added two new features for Pine which can
be set from Setup in Pine and controlled from pinerc.

* enable-send-only-8bit		Send out 8 bit character with 8BIT
				content-transfer-encoding instead of
				QP or BASE64.
* enable-8bit-in-subject	Allow 8 bit editing in Subject field.

  These two features should be useful if you and recipient are both
using 8 bit clean MTAs, and the MUA is not MIME capable. Disable these
features if you find there were MTAs which will strip message into
7 bit.

  Hope this help before Pine 3.92 comes to real. :-) 

PS: The patch is also available by a email to myhsu@db.csie.ncu.edu.tw
    with "Retrieve pine-for-8bit" in the Subject field.

the imap daemon, for pine, seems to have a 30 min inactivity timer. when
using windows pine & timed out, the window becomes locked on the pc, which
is very annoying. any suggestions, other than dumping windows? 

thanks,

If it is on the localhost, why not tell Pine to open it as a mailfolder,
giving it the path. You can create folder-collections to make this appear
more aesthetic.

In comp.mail.pine, some queer sunspot activity fomented fuzzy@asarian.org to pen:

 -  my usual way to get news is via nntp to my providers news server.  in
 -  addition I've setup local usenet for a handfull of news groups. to
 -  workaround the the fact the news item numbers are different for the local

 -  subscription file (instead of .newsrc). I dont know if pine uses that file
 -  to determine what articles to display as unread.  I called the new tin ltin
 -  vs tin which is really rtin (nntp). 

 -  what do I need to put into the pine.conf file to have pine see the local
 -  news spool as a news source (/usr/spool/news/...)? And can it be told to
 -  look for .lnwsrc vs .newsrc so both the remote and local servers will
 -  continue to work correctly.

If the server is running an 'imap' daemon, then you can use Pine as a MUA
to read your incoming-mail of that server.

pine -f "{mail.server.address/imap}INBOX"

Replcae mail.server.address with the address of the mailserver that you are
trying to read mail from. This will prompt you for your userid and passwd on
that mail-server and once you key that in, you are all set.

Oh! BTW is there any mail-server out there that don't require a passwd? :)

If you need to Add an address to an existing list, you will have to go into
List Take Mode rather than Single Take Mode. Use the Apply-Take method to
go into List mode after selecting the mail with the ";" command.

In comp.mail.pine, some queer sunspot activity fomented Matt Simmons to pen:
 -  When 'T'aking a name from the inbox, and attempting to add it to a
 -  distribution list (I tried with an empty list and a non-empty list), Pine
 -  gives an "Error updating addressbook: Pine Bug" message.  

 -  It asked me if I wanted to replace the list with the address taken from the
 -  inbox.  Ideally, IMHO, Pine should either automatically add the name to the
 -  list, or present an option to do so.  The error occurred after I indicated
 -  that Pine was to replace the list with the new name, and I accepted the
 -  default values for the ensuing prompts.  The message appeared at the point
 -  where Pine usually adds the name to the addressbook and writes it out to
 -  disk.

 -  Sorry if this bug has been reported before -- I've been less than religious

You need to key in your ISP account's login passwd in order to download mail
from that account via 'imap'. Do you mean by "set the password"  be able to
change the passwd on the ISP account while accessing that account via imap
from Pine. In that case the answer is 'no'. Atelast not at the moment...
Pine's change passwd feature belongs only to localhost not remote.

In comp.mail.pine, some queer sunspot activity fomented barry@telerama.lm.com to pen:
 -  I'd like to use pine on a computer system at work to access mail
 -  received at my personal account at a local ISP.  I use Eudora from
 -  my Mac at home to retrieve mail from the IMAP server at the ISP, so
 -  I'm sure the ISP end is OK.

 -  I think I have .pinerc configured to access that IMAP server at my
 -  ISP.  I think my problem is that I'm unable to set the password I need
 -  to access the remote IMAP server.  When I try to use the pine new
 -  password command, pine asks me for the old password.  I haven't the
 -  foggiest idea what the password value is!  The only password that
 -  matters at Transarc is the Kerberos password, but I doubt that this is
 -  what is being checked by pine.  I haven't used the UNIX 'passwd'
 -  command in years.  In any case, I don't want to use the same password
 -  at work and at the ISP.

 -  So, where does pine look for the password?  How do I set it if I can't
 -  provide the old value?  The /etc/passwd entry on the system where I
 -  ran pine has "!", which probably means look somewhere else.

It also tells you that Pine doesn't do that and you need external mail
delivery agents like procmail, filter, deliver etc in order to be able
to file incoming mail into folders automatically.

Sure, you can delete the ".newsrc" file; this will unsubsvribe you from 
all the newsgroups in one go.  When you use Pine to (A)dd a newsgroup 
(subscribe to it) the ".newsrc" file will get recreated containing just 
that/those newsgroups.

Some newsreaders automatically check for new newsgroups as they start 
up.  Pine does not do that at present (it may one day; anyone care to 
comment?).

Until then you either have to skim doen the whole list looking for 
anything new (not really practicable), or else use some other utility.

For example I've knocked up a little Perl script we'll be using here to 
check for new newsgroups.  I've also heard of something called 
"choosenews", but don't know anything else about it.

While this response may not come intime for you, however you can use this
in future if you come across this problem.

The reason why Pine prompts you first and then says No msgs postponed really
is due to the existence a file in your $HOME called ".pine-interrupted"
Just get rid of that file, by "rm" ing it and then go into Pine.

In comp.mail.pine, some queer sunspot activity fomented Renee Faulk to pen:

 -  Ah!  He's on our side.

What's this our side your side thing? Pine's thus far the best thing to
happen to Unix as far as making it user friendly is concerned....I learnt
(still learning) it the hard way....and sometimes feel envious about all
these new kids who have access to Pine to do their mail reading business
from the very start.

Agreed there's way a user who has absolutely _no clue_ can inadvertantly
post an e-mail to the usenet even after being repeatedly warned before
letting him to do it.

But the point is who are you trying to save? There are lotsa junky postings
already floating on the usenet. I'm not even talking about AOL users...
people who flame and post personal messages and then flame that on the net
and all that....private e-mail getting onto the net is nothing new, this
not by mistake but well intended...and even if it isin't a personal mail,
then they would spoof mail such a way that the origin is from a particular
user and then quote it.....so it is _NO_ big deal.

You guys should give the wonderful Pine Team a respite and let them concentrate
on developing Pine more and more and stop this nuisance.

Have an extremely enjoyable Sunday night!

Are you telling it to use 'nntp' or 'smtp' protocol to use? Since you are
running Sendmail as MTA you don't need to specify anything for the smtp-server.

Do this at the prompt and see if it works...

pine -f "*{your.nttp.server.adrs/nntp}comp.mail.pine"

In the above just replace your nntp-server's address.

In comp.mail.pine, some queer sunspot activity fomented Cynthia Guy to pen:

I shouldn't have to. It should check to see if a list already exists under
the name I give it.  If the list does exist, the name should be added
(optionally, a prompt could be given to overwrite the list).  Actually, it's
broken whichever way you look at it: as it is, it asks you if you want to
overwrite the existing list, you say yes, it bombs out during the
addressbook write sequence with a "Pine Bug" error.

I am using Procomm2 for Windows which also offer a Gif viewer

To the mail you already generated. The mail you sent predated the
reply. The reply does not contain a reference to a message that didn't
exit.

This is marginally RFC-compliant.

But it was created before the reference.

No, if you are going to create an example of mail which references mail
not yet in existance, then you will have to assume that someone is going
to the effort of creating their own message id's, and that they are
saying "this mail references another piece of mail I haven't written
yet, but will assign id X to when I do."

When you do that, I will tell you that news will happily accept the same
situation. In other words, if I want to create my own ID's, I can post
news that refers to an article I haven't written yet. In fact, both news
and mail will function quite well if I forget to write the message I
predicted I would. News leaves a gap in the thread, which is no
different than what happens when followups arrive after the original.

This option is present already, at least in version 3.91:

# Determines default folder name for Saves...

# Default: "default-folder", i.e. "saved-messages" (Unix) or "SAVEMAIL" (PC).

This is IMHO, so take it with the usual rock of salt.  Your mileage may 
vary.  Void were restricted or prohibited.

The problem with the old rn-style behavior is that while it was fine when
there were only a few hundred newsgroups, it simply does not scale to
today's reality of thousands of newsgroups, with daily additions or
deletions which may number in the hundreds. 

rn was terribly annoying when it forced me to answer hundreds of questions
about did I want to subscribe to such-and-such a newsgroup at startup.  
And the only correct answer was "yes", then "unsubscribe", since 
answering no would only cause it to ask me about it again the next time I 
ran rn!  Then came the torture of having it remove newsgroups that were 
deleted (e.g. class-based newsgroups).

The behavior of making you identify the newsgroups you want to see, as 
opposed to making you identify the newsgroups you *don't* want to see, 
was at least in part based upon a reaction to rn's behavior.  
Similarly, non-existant newsgroups in .newsrc are ignored, instead of 
provoking error messages, again for the same reason.

Also, there were some technical considerations which led to the current 
behavior.

Then again, I only read about 20 or so newsgroups, and generally never
read a newsgroup unless I've been referred to it.  People who want to read
every single newsgroup may feel differently.

In the next version of pine this will be fixed so that the method doesn't 
depend on how many addresses in the message.  You'll always be able to 
use method 2.

Under normal circumstances, windows pine keeps the connection alive.  I
never have this problem on my system.  So something unusual is happening on
your system.  A couple other users have complained about this bug as well. 

Make sure that you are running a current version of the IMAP server.

Under what circumstances does the timeout occur?  Does it happen if the 
pine window is left in the foreground?  In the background?  Iconized?

What other applications are you running?

What TCP/IP software do you have?

Finally, it may be helpful if you generate a debug log of a pine session
that hangs and mail it to us.  Do this by turning on debugging with the
command line option '-d 8'  (levels 0-9 are possible, 8 should produce
copious debugging info).  Run pine until it hangs.  Then look for the 
debug log (should be pinedebg.txt in the same directory as pine.exe)
and mail that to us.

Hi all,

This is something that I haven't seen specifically addressed in the FAQ. 
I have a user that uses PINE on a (true) VT320 terminal, using a serial 
4800 bps connection to a terminal server. He complaints about PINE 
locking up not only when typing certain control characters (which would 
be expected), but doing things as simple as moving around the message 
with the keyboard arrows.

Has anybody gotten PINE to work reliably on a true VT320 (no emulation). 
I'm eager to hear any experiences/advice on this.

Thanks much!

To All,

All of a sudden, I can't send any mail on my "thalia" account...it gets 
returned. Nobody else on the system seems to be having a problem. The To: 
field expands properly, and everything looks fine, but when I ^X to send, 
it pauses at "Sending Mail" and "possible alias loop" shows up 
momentarily at the bottom of the screen. I then get the following from 
the Mailer-Daemon:

The unsent message DOES NOT follow...it stops at content-length: 0

The mailaliases file hasn't been updated for quite some time, and I've 
been able to send mail fine...until today! I have been using procmail, 
and get my mail forwarded from netcom, but everything has been working 
fine. The only thing I can think of that could be causing the problem is 
that last night I enabled "enable-header-command", but even toggling that 
on-off doesn't seem to help. And I think I did that 2-3 nights ago 
anyway, but have been able to send mail...until today! Also...no problem 
with incoming mail.

PLEASE HELP!

Does pine understand mechanism for coding international characters in=20

This is fine except for one thing... it obviously doesn't say "you received
this message as private mail" in the same question. If it did, people would
not be so surprised to hear that the message they quoted to the net hadn't
been intended to be public.

In such a case it is a breach of netiquette to reply at all. Or at least it's
counterproductive.

	Not in 3.91.  I know it is a planned feature....but don't know
if it would be in 3.92 or 3.9X.

For some reason, when I post to a mailing list, my name gets screwed up 
in the index.  Instead of

23  Michael Pollak      Subject

like you'd normally get, I get

23 To: badsubjects      Subject

Why is the "To:" line where the "From" line should be?  It's never 
happened to me on usenet.  Has anyone else run into this problem and 
figured out the solution?  Many thanks.

Time will tell -- I am not sure.  I reinstalled sendmail here to be
8-bit transparent, and nobody noticed except the users who had
requested this change.

For a real-life example I refer you to the battle of Apple vs MacTCP
users.

This thread is not pine-specific, so follow-ups are set to
comp.mail.headers.

Anyone:
	This may sound like an odd scenario, but it comes up quite often:
I want to reply to a message and not only include the original, but also
insert the text from some other message somewhere else (possibly in a
different folder).  The only kludge I could come up with is first
exporting that message to my home directory and then using ^R to read in
the file when editing (I use pine's internal pico).  Is there a better
way?  Could this become an implemented feature if not?
	Thanks in advance for any help.

I agree with you completely.  Zmailer should not be gratuitously
rewriting a perfectly valid, RFC 822 conforming, address into
something which is not even syntactically valid.

The IMAP servers then try to turn this garbage back into something
that is syntactically valid, but as you seem to have found out it is
sometimes Garbage In Garbage Out.

  I think the problem rests with the fact that the IMAP server pipes the 
mail into sendmail.  On Zmailer systems, sendmail is just a stub 
program.  I believe that it assumes that all mail submitted is local.  

  The best fix is to hack the IMAP server to submit mail directly into 
$POSTOFFICE/router

    Not at present.  It's on the List, but I haven't heard if it will
be included in 3.92.

Hello Pine-ers --

I have a faculty member who receives most of his mail in Russian. When he 
attempts to save a message to a file (via save or export) he loses alot 
of special characters.  

This isn't just a pine problem; he had this same problem with the mailer 
we used to use.

Anybody have any ideas?

Thanks,

Oooops, forgot to chmod 755 and check it out.  The 2.6 Mb file size had me

Do these : On the main menu, select SETUP, then select `Config' at the 
prompt that follows. Go down to "feature-list" on the screen that shows
up, under feature-list, look for "signature-at-bottom", and put an X in
to enable it. It should look like this :

feature-list           =
            Set        Feature Name
            ---   ----------------------
            [ ]  assume-slow-link  
             .
             .
             .
            [X]  signature-at-bottom   
             .
             .

This is a fairly easier way of doing it, you can also do this by 
editing your .pinerc file, though its more of a mess I have to tell
you, compared with the way recommended above. On the other hand, it
surely helps to go through "jargon" like that if you have time, that's
how I knew of all these.

Hope this helps.

I don't think my message got received on this list, so I'll post again.

I am interested in any work people are doing to develop an MS-Windows GUI
for PINE.  I understand someone is working on an X-WINDOWS version called
Spruce (the author is on vacation right now).

It would be nice to have a version which is _consistent_ in-as-much-as-
possible across these platforms and be FREE.  I'm disappointed to see
that all the GUI's for MS-Windows are commercial.

Equally, I'm interested in whether or not a *.DLL could be created from
the c-client sources to enable easy programming/hacking for a mail GUI
on MS-Windows.  

Thanks alot,

Forrest

We are looking at using Pine running on a HP9000, and wonder if
anyone else is running a similar set up, and if so, whether
you have come across any problem with it.

We expect to put about 70 users onto the system using both
dumb terminals and PC clients.

Many Thanks

Since Pine is the only mail program that does this and since Pine is not
a MTA this is not possible.

The "Newsgroups" header does not contain any information about "who saw
this" unless the message was received as news. Pine should discard or
transform "Newsgroups" headers when it doesn't know the message was
posted to news.

If the message has those Cc: headers, that means it was sent to those
places, regardless of origin.

If the message has Newsgroups: headers that doesn't mean anything unless
the message was received as news, because Newsgroups: isn't a mail header.

I'm willing to be betrayed intentionally by a human. I consider it
unreasonable to be betrayed by a user interface. Especially when there
is enough information available to that user interface to do the right
thing. Software is a lot easier to fix than people.

I am using Pine 3.91 and Emacs 19.27 and when I send a message from Emacs 
to Pine, the sender/From information is lost.  This happens when sending 
from both a DEC Alpha an an HP.  Any help?

Thanks,
Zach

But what you think is "the right thing" and what others think is the
right thing are different.  For example, I think the right thing is
for a mail/news reader to tell me where a message has been mailed
and/or posted and then ask me which of these places, and what new
places, my response should go.  Currently this is not possible.  I
still think we need a new header (or headers) that would contain this
information.  And then mail/news user agents should be configurable
so that a user can customize the response behaviour.  For example, if
you never want to do a newsgroup response to a news article that you
get via email then you should be able to set a variable that
disallows that.  But if I want to be able to do a newsgroup response
to a news article that I receive in mail, I should be able to set a
variable to allow that.  I think the default setting should be to
disallow posting responses to news messages received in mail because
we want to discourage new users from doing a news response when they
haven't read the entire thread.  But once a user knows how it all
works, she should be able to set a variable that allows her to easily
respond to any or all of the individuals, mailing lists, and
newsgroups that also got the message.

Does anyone else think we need a new header (or headers) to make this
possible?

Of course it is.  No debate here.

If Pine saves a news article in a folder and does not put the flag that
says "this was news" in it, then why doesn't it?

However, the assumption that "it isn't news unless you know it is" would
not prevent private replies, and it would prevent the posting of mail by
accident. The latter is the goal.

Once again, the point is not that some people find the complete
integration nice. The point is that some people DO NOT. In any case,
using trn is hardly much more daunting than trying to figure out how to
tell pine about newsgroups. In fact, I just looked for the way to set up
news in 3.89, and I still don't know how to set up news for a local
spool, or what I would do if I didn't know the name of my local NNTP
server.

The majority of people who use newsreaders that put Newsgroups: headers
in mail do not read this group. Trying to make those who object to the
blanket statement that mail and news are the same responsible for
changing all the sites that do things wrong is going to work about as
well as making all those who say it is the same responsible.

pine-3.91 is crashing for us.  The last thing in .pine-crash is
"about to end_tty_driver", followed by an abort signal.  I am supicious of the
Raw() function, which looks like it may be using one of the obsolete
terminal interfaces, rather than the new and POSIX termios.

(This is, however, a step up from pine-3.89 on SVR4, which panicked.)

We're running NetBSD-current as of two weeks or so ago, and it's a 68k

verbose mode?  (You know, so you can observe the "conversation" between 
the two (origin and destination) mail daemons to verify your mail reached 
its destination).

Thanx in advance,

Is there a way to 'remark' a message as being new after it has been 
read?  I would like to read messages from home using pine in the evening, 
and leave them as new so that Eudora will allow me to re-read and manage
them on my PC the next morning...

Thanks.

	Yes.  From the index display you would use the * (Flag) command.
You need to be using pine 3.90+ and you need to have the enable-flag-cmd
set in your configuration.

Michael, 
This behavior has nothing to do with posting, it's just the way Pine
displays the index of the messages you are *reading*... 

As Selcuk said, Pine figures you already know what your own name is, so when
a message in the Index is from you, it displays the *recipient* name in 
the index instead of your name. 

(If you get a different result using another program to post it's only
because that other program uses a different form of your name, so Pine
doesn't recognize the message as from you.)

Bzzt.  By ``not correct,'' I have to assume that you mean ``not
something that I agree with.''

Eh?  I have a big system and messages arrive from all over the place,
more than just ``mail'' and ``news''.  They use a common representation
(the basic RFC 822 header/body separation, the basic RFC 822 mechanism
to separate the individual headers).  Differences are encapsulated by
those headers as they need to be.  Convince me that the difference is
truly important.

> What we CAN say about the correct solution is that it is NOT "screw

Another oversight.  By ``correct'' I have to read ``pragmatic.'' 
``Correct'' is a powerful word and it doesn't help to over-use it; it's
just inflammatory.

Who uses them as ``oil and water''?  Maybe some folks, sure.  But it's
not fair to go from a wishy-washy statement about ``those who use them
tend to treat'' to ``it is imperative.''

Let's cut the high-handed rhetoric.  This topic has had more than its
share of heat for its amount of light.  If there are technical points to
make, let's make them but leave the flame-talk at home.

Right now Pine does not have a flag for messages saved in folders that
says "this was news".  I'm curious about a few things:

 * Which newsreaders allow you to save news articles into mail
   folders?  I know nn and pine do but what about tin and trn?  
   And what about all the Windows/Mac readers?

 * Of these newsreaders, which have a way to distinguish whether 
   a message came via news or mail?

I think, as I said many months ago, that we need a new header (or
headers) for these things.  As we all know from this endless
discussion, the Newsgroups header is not going to work for this
purpose because it's too entrenched in the system in newsreaders
that include it in mail-only messages.  How about having a header,
maybe called something like Type or Transport that can take one or
more of these values:

Value     Meaning
=====     =======
M         mail (but not mailing list)
N         news
L         mailing list

So, for example, if a message were posted and mailed it would have
this header:

Type: MN

And if a message were sent to a mailing list and Cc'd to users it
would have this:

Type: ML

etc., etc.

Then mail processors, news processors, folder managers, etc. could
be developed to intelligently deal  with all the different
combinations.

My apologies for side-comments about unadventurous people...  I had
forgotten that the "flag" command had to be enabled in the Configuration
Setup screen (and to use the Select and/or Apply commands you'll also need
to enable the "aggregate command set" option there).

(I'm constantly amazed at how unadventurous people are... :-)

Pine very helpfully displays a menu of commands at the bottom of the 
screen.  One of the commands that's shown is "O" for Other.  This 
modifies the menu to show you other commands (the ones that wouldn't fit 
on the first screen).

Pressing this a couple of times with a message selected/being read shows 
the "*" (Flag) command.  Using this lets you set the status of a message 
pretty much as you like (including back to "N" (New)).

Useful hint: if you have a lot of messages to do you can almost certainly 
use the ";" (Select) command to choose them according to some criteria, 
and then "A" (Apply) a "*" command to the selection.

    You can also get in the habit of opening your mailbox read-only,
meaning Pine will not write anything to indicate that the message is no
longer new.  The command  pine -o  does this.  The drawback to this is
that once the inbox is opened, Pine no longer bothers to check to see if
any new mail has been received during the time you are reading; however,
all messages that were ``new'' when you started Pine will stay that way,
which is what you want when reading from home.

Help.
Ok, I'm a LINUX new user and have tried to get the answer to this 
question from too many people... No luck in man pages or sysadmin.

Is there anyway to configure Pine to automatically place mail from 
certain users is their folders?  I.E. Mail from Bob@bob.net would be 
automatically put into folder BOB.

Email response is preferred, but a followup is fine; you all are doing me 
a favor, I'm not gonna complain.

Thanks alot,

Subject: Local pine traffic goes via Internet
Date: 22 Mar 1995 04:17:34 GMT
Message-Id: <3ko8cu$2tr@hustle.rahul.net>

I am running Pine 3.91, as compiled and available on the ftp server
ftp.novell.de, on Unixware 1.1.2. 
If I send mail to another user on my system, it is routed via my Internet
provider and back to my system as a domain name address.
I can send mail from elm, and it stays local to my machine.
Traffic intended for the internet works fine, and actually, so does the
local mail, except for the extra hop or two that it makes.

The only "config" options that I set were to make an smtp mailer equal to
localhost, and specify my domain name, as suggested in the Novell tips.  
I also tried using my machine name, rather than localhost, as the
smtp-mailer, with the same effect.

This is a problem/feature of your local mail configuration. You need
to set your mailsurr to recognise your domain address as a local
delivery. The following extracts from the HINTS doc on novell.de
should help....

Q. Mail sent to my domain mydom.com does not arrive locally on the
machine. It gets here but the local mailsystem does not recognise it
as local.

A. Add an entry to /etc/mail/mailcnfg

%d=mydom.com

If you have the nuc package installed , edit /usr/lib/mail/mailsurr.proto
to create a translation entry in  that file.  The user@domain
entry is shown below from the mailsurr.proto file:

# Map all names of the form user@local-machine -> user
# Map all names of the form user@uname -> user
# Map all names of the form user@domain
# Then loop back through from the top.
#
'.+'  '(.+)@%L'    'Translate R=\\1'
'.+'  '(.+)@%U'    'Translate R=\\1'
'.+'  '(.+)@%d'    'Translate R=\\1'   #This is the added entry for user@domain


Then run the script /usr/lib/mail/surrcmd/createSurr.

If you don't have the nuc package installed, add an entry to
/etc/mail/mailsurr as:

####
#### Part 2
####


# Map all names of the form host.uucp!user -> host!user
# Map all names of the form host.local-domain!user -> host!user
#       (host must not have a . in it)
# Comment out if you do not want these translations.
#
#'.+'   '!([^!]+)\\.uucp!(.+)'  'Translate R=!\\1!\\2'
#'.+'   '!([^!.]+)%D!(.+)'      'Translate R=!\\1!\\2'
'.+'    '!%d!(.+)'      'Translate R=\\2'

I compiled Pine 3.91 under 2.3 (admittedly not 2.4) having made the
following changes:

. Edited pine/osdep/os-sv4.h:

  . Set the locations of the pine global configuration files;
  . De-commented the setting of ANSI;
  . Commented the null definition of "const".
  
. Edited pine/makefile.sol:
  
  . Commented out the compiler flag setting for -g -DDEBUG.
  . De-commented the compiler flag setting for -O. 
  
. Typed "build sol" at top level. 

It all built straight away. There were a number of compiler warnings,
some about changes of comparisons for ANSI semantics, and some for
apparent differences of argument types to some routines. These do not
seem to matter. We've been using it for months.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII


At our university we are running pine 3.90,  I only today discovered the 
enable-aggregate-command switch...  previously I was going through Usenet 
mail message by message deleting all the messages I didn't want to read 
one by one.  

The problem arises, is that if I delete a lot > 50 or so...  when I 
change folder or exit, pine raises an 'Abort Signal' basically putting me 
back to unix shell... terminating the program... the .newsrc is not 
updated... and I still have 500 or so messages to delete...

This error happens if I even delete the messages manually, one by one.  I 
have even tried 'X' (expunging) the messages... that works, but it still 
crashes out when I go to quit or change folder.

Is this a bug in the program, or have I done something wrong??...  I am a 
bit confused by it all... and I just cannot delete mail in one big go...

We don't seem to have procmail so I cant filter out the messages I don't 
want.  I will have to see the systems manager for advice I think...

Anyway.....  any help is appreciated :-)

 I'm not sure whether this is a bug or a feature or whether it has 
 been reported before or not.

 If you postpone a message in PINE by hitting "Cntrl-o" the message
 is left in "/tmp" even after you re-compose and send it. You have
 to explicitly delete the file by using "rm".

This is not a bug but, a feature. Pine sees that the mail is from
yourself and thinks that From: information is not that interesting
anymore. Instead, the To: info is more important. So, it shows that.

To All,

I (a novice at Unix) ran into a similar problem when I wanted to download
to my Mac a folder containing a specific set of mail, all from one
in-house group that followed a particular thread. Even though I included
myself in the distribution list and so automatically saved mail (via
procmail) into a particular folder, it showed "To: ..." rather than
"From..." My workaround was: 

   I simply went into "vi" and used the "replace" command to change
   "<Roman Hryniszak>" to <Magic          > and "rhrynisz" to "       " This
   made pine NOT recognize it as mail from me, and it changed my real name
   to my nickname, with the result being that the index said "From: Magic"
   rather than "To:..."

My original thought was to have one of the group bounce all my messages
back to me (how come the "Apply" command DOES NOT include "bounce"???),
but that didn't work, even AFTER I stripped out out the "Resent" lines
with grep. Fortunately, though, my little workaround fixes everything I
want done.

Hope this helped???

Stacy,

Put an entry in the ./mail/aliases file and run newaliases per the 
directions in the aliases file.

That sounds like an absolutely smashing idea. However for messages
received via a protocol containing headers intended for another this
isn't available. In that case the right thing is to discard those
headers, or somehow mark them as "suspect". Do you disagree with that?

When composing message go to the area of headers; two help lines below=20
will change a bit and you'll see a possibility `^R Reach Headers' (the same=
=20
`^R' means read file in the area of the message text!) Press `Ctrl' ang `R'=
=20
keys and you will see more header lines including `BCc:' line. Put an=20
alias of your distribution list there.

Hope this helps.

Hello.  Does Pine have the capability of displaying the message ID
in the headers when replying to an article or question in a newsgroup?
If so, how does one get this to happen?  If not, do the creators of
Pine expect this to change in upcoming versions of Pine?

Thanks in advance.

    This shouldn't be a problem.  Pine saves messages as they are
received, whether with quoted-printable or just-send-8 encoding.  My
guess is that most messages are sent from Russia as 8-bit messages.

    Pine exports messages, if I remember, decoded to 8-bit text, so
you need only the correct display and 8-bit clean path.  I trust you
have the correct font, but Pine passes 8-bit data even when you have
not specially set up your environment for 8-bit data.

    Are you using Unix?  If so, what does  stty -a  show?  If you have
not set up your environment to pass 8-bit data, you will need to do an
stty pass8  or similar.  If your problem is that the special characters
you mention were converted to ASCII characters, this should be your
solution.  If not, provide more details about your setup and how the
characters are lost or munged...

Huh?  I don't know of any IMAP servers that call sendmail either directly
or indirectly.  IMAPd reads folders that the MTA writes, but that is as
close as they get.

Sending mail is done from the MUA (e.g. Pine), not the IMAP server.  Pine
assumes that "sendmail" is available by default, but you can always set
smtp-server to have it bypass the direct call...

Hi,
   I use Pine on an HP 712. I got the compiled distribution from
the Washington site (not sure what version).
Whenever I start pine in an hpterm and go to
my inbox, if I scroll down, the highlight stays on the first
item and continues to shade the items without unhighlighting
the previous ones. This is kind of annoying. I do a <cntl>-L
to clean up but is there anyhting that can be done to prevent
this from happening? This happens on ALL screens not just the
initial. Please e-mail. I can post a followup if anyone else has
this problem.

Thanks,
Brad

Indeed.  However, if it's mail, this is perfectly valid by RFC822.  In news,
RFC1036 describes exactly how to create the references line, and this would
be invalid.  You could do it, of course, but you shouldn't.

I was pointing out that your original assertion:

>... it is impossible for a mail references header to contain the
>ids of messages that aren't older than the mail the header is in.

is incorrect.  Not only is it possible, but it's valid.  However, if the
references line in news is constructed as RFC1036 says, then the messages
referenced must be older, and further must be ancestors of the current
article.  Neither of these is true of RFC822 references in mail.

  I am using (or starting to use) the Windows version of 
PC-Pine (3.91).  Is there any info on the differences 
between Pine and PC-Pine?  I found out that ';' (select) 
doesn't work from the Folder List screen, what other 
features are not implemented in the PC version?

Thanks...

Hello, everyone.

I wonder if there is any way I can make Pine highlight a message not with

to do.  Please email me at the address in this article, or post here.

Thanks for all help.

Message-Id: <D5wKsK.Fou@postoffice.ptd.net>
Date: Thu, 23 Mar 1995 17:05:08 GMT

For some reason, when I make posts with Pine 3.91 they never show
up anywhere but locally.  I have tested this with posts to misc.test.
If I post manually they show up in misc.test and I get autoresponse
messages in email.  When I post with pine, the message shows up in
misc.test locallay BUT it doesn't show up in misc.test when I read
news at other sites AND I do not receive autoresponse messages.

I have compared the headers of the messages posted with the two 
messages.  The only main differences that I see are in the message-id
line and the fact that the pine posted message has an X-Sender line.
The message-id line in the pine posted msg starts with pine and a 
version number.  Also, the bit referring to my email is truncated
from dmg@ns1.ptd.net to dmg@ns1.  The message id in the manually
posted message looks more like my real email address.  The X-Sender
line in the pine posted message truncates my email address to
dmg@ns1 ...

Any help is appreciated.  My guess is that something with the way
pine is set up here is causing the pine posted messages to not
be distributed.  I just don't know what.  Reply via email to
dmg@postoffice.ptd.net if you can help.  Thanks.

>But the bcc: people are all visible to each other.

If a message that you send has no To: header, then if it is processed
by the 'sendmail' program at the receiving site, it will have an
Apparently-To: header inserted listing each recipient at that site.
So, for example, suppose 5 of your 400 recipient are at the same site.
Then these 5 will see each other listed in the Apparently-To:
headers.  Solution:  Make sure your message has at least one To:
recipient -- it could even be yourself.

In most other cases, bcc recipients will in fact be not visible.  Some
broken mail software at a receiving site may not correctly suppress bcc
recipients.  But in such cases, only the bcc recipients at that site
will see each other.  They won't see the entire bcc list.

HUMAN ERROR:  One common problem with bcc as usually implemented is
that the recipient does not always realize he is bcc'd, and may send
a reply to the message that reveals his bcc status.  This can be *very*
embarrassing.  For example:

- joe@foo.com sends email to his boss boss@foo.com, discussing
  some very confidential company business.  Joe bcc's his wife
  susan@bar.com, since he trusts her, but he doesn't want his boss
  to know he has cc'd her.  Unfortunately bar.com happens to be a
  competitor of foo.com.

- susan@bar.com doesn't realize she was bcc'd, thinks it was just
  a normal cc, doesn't realize the email contained highly confidential
  information, absent-mindedly sends a reply which automatically
  goes to both joe@foo.com and boss@foo.com.

- Joe gets fired.

One solution is for bcc'd mail to be reformatted to have only a single
recipient and separately delivered to each bcc'd user.  Then replies
from the bcc'd people will never accidentally go to anybody except
the original sender.  I don't think pine tries to do this.

	If your are running pine 3.9X....go to the setup/configure
and find the feature assume-slow-link.

	From the Help:

          FEATURE: assume-slow-link

This feature affects Pine's display routines.  If set, the normal
inverse-video cursor (used to highlight the current item in a list) will be
replaced by an "arrow" cursor and other screen update optimizations for
low-speed links (e.g. 2400 bps dialup connections) will be activated.

    This is because your system is running BSD Sendmail v8.6.10.
Ask them to upgrade to 8.6.11, I believe this problem is solved.
Or, try to configure Pine to use an SMTP-server, rather than
passing your mail to sendmail directly.

Something you could do is activate the "read-messages" folder.  You can 
do this in the Setup/Config option (3.91).  This will move your read msgs 
to a new folder located in the ~./mail directory.  The msgs get moved as 
soon as you leave pine (well, actually it will ask you for it, I just 
have those options to be runned automatically).
Hope that helps.

    Jorge.

Lets take the case of a Private Email Reply being created by Pine from a
Newsgroup Article (Note: This is an Email-Only Reply not an Post w/Cc-via
Email). The Email gets sent with a Newsgroups Header. It is received by
another Pine and a reply is generated. If the user says "reply to everyone
who saw this" that SHOULD be only the original sender not the Sender and the
Newsgroup but Pine will send to the newsgroup due to the original Pine
REFUSING to tell the receiving Pine that the message was an Email-Only
Reply.

Hi,
	just a note, hoping that someone might have done this.... I find
	apply/select very useful, but there's one thing missing that I 
	would find really useful....

	For example, I have a bunch of messages pulled out via select/zoom.
	I really would like it if pine would allow be to then bounce each
	message on the 'zoomed' list onto another recipient, so that if
	he then replies to the messages they go to the original sender.

	As far as I can see, the only similar functionality that's offered
	is 'forward' and this will only forward the messages selected 
	en-masse in a single message, which is fair enough for forward,
	because they'd all appear to come from the same person if 
	forwarded idividually anyway.....

	so, will bounce be added to the 'apply' menu at some point....
	has someone already done it?

	enquiring minds want to know.

Instead of ^X you can press ESC twice and then X. This is the way you can
workaround your problem. It works with any other key e.g, ^C = ESC ESC C.

Hope this help

Subject: Pine claims folder locked when it's not
Message-Id: <D5tBpK.IBy@monygmc.mony.com>
Date: Tue, 21 Mar 1995 22:56:08 GMT

I've built Pine 3.91 on an system running HP-UX 9.04.  I've run into a
problem where when pine tries to write the Fcc to the sent-mail file, it
thinks that there's a lock on that file and it waits a while for the
lock to open (which it never does) before overriding the lock and
writing the file.  I know that there is no process with a real lock open
on that file, and I can't find a file that looks like a lock file either
in my mail directory, the spooled mail directory, or in /tmp.

I'm running "standalone" (i.e., I'm not communicating with imapd) since
this is running locally on the HP system.  Any suggestions as to where I
might look to figure out what's causing this problem?

 I have the same problem. Solved it for myself by starting pine in xterm,=
=20
but it is a bit `strange' solution. Any advice will be appreciated.

helo all,

some of my mails are auto-forwarded from another host via 
resend (PP/ISODE).

Now the following header fields are displayed when reading the mail
although display of full headers is off.

Resent-Date: Wed, 22 Mar 1995 04:12:10 +0000
Resent-From: martin.spohn@zdv.uni-tuebingen.de
Resent-To: zrnsm01@bamm.zdv.uni-tuebingen.de

Is there a way to suppress these lines?

thanks

Actually, The Bcc: addresses should be invisible to everyone.  The problem
is that some mail transports (e.g. sendmail) will insert Apparently-To:
headers for the blind addresses.  This can usually be avoided by inserting
something in the To: header...

Hello,

Is there any FAQ that explains all the "filtering"
PINE has to offer or one can do with mailboxes?


Thanks,

Is there a way to ensure that all the internet routing info which is 
"added" to the body of a message is inhibitted on *outgoing* messages?  I 
have a feeling this is probably a setup problem of the people I am 
sending mail to (since I, using pine 3.91, am not getting it).

This is a problem for me because I am sending mail to people using 
cc:mail attached linked to the outside world using a gateway through 
sprintmail.  Sprint is used to get the message to the cc:mail postoffice, 
which in turn parses the first line(s) of the body of the message to get the 
local address where the message is going.  When all the routing info is 
appended to the message, the first line is no longer what the postoffice 
expects, and routes the message to the admin saying: unknown address.

[You may wonder why each user doesn't have full access to the net.  The 
answer is that these people are in Colombia where Internet access is not 
yet very easy to get...]

Any help, hints or pointers highly appreciated.

I use pine (and love it) through TENET (Texas Education Network). PINE, I 
assume, is located on the computers in Austin. Often, it is more 
convenient for me to download my mail to my local pc and read it off 
line. I can do this, but each folder becomes a file, and I lose the 
capability of quickly jumping from one message to the next, etc. If there 
are 25 messages in a folder, I have to page through the long file until 
all are read.

My question is, "Is there a simple (or not so simple) version of PINE 
that I can download (I can get files via WWW or FTP), set up on my pc 
(Windows, DOS, or both), then read the messages off line?"

Thanks for your help!

Subject: Problem with remote Pine with POP3
Date: 23 Mar 1995 15:10:07 -0500
Message-Id: <3kskiv$o3b@linet01.li.net>

Hi,

Sorry if this is some kind of FAQ question.

I have trouble running Pine accessing remote mailbox on a mail server 
with POP3.  The inbox-path setting in Pine's configuration looks like 
{mail.server.path/POP3}/inbox.  Pine accesses the mail server without a 
trouble, but it can't parse some of the messages and shows [No Message 
Text Available] for them in the Index. When I open such a message, it 
shows full headers including all routing information (which make me think 
that there is a parsing problem) but no body text. Also, all messages 
are shown in the Index as Not read and with 0 length, even those messages 
which Pine can show.
I tried this both with popper and ipop3d daemons. The same effect. BTW, 
in both cases the local access works just fine. Remote access through 
imapd works fine also. 

I would appreciate any kind of advice on this issue.
Thanks in advance,

Hi,
  This "newbie" seeking advice on the upgrading of Pine 3.89 to the 3.91
version for Windows 3.1. Have saved the "zip" archive containing the 
distribution but have not learned the correct commands for creating the 
new directory and unpacking the archive using the PKUNZIP.EXE program.
Can anyone provide these??

                   Many thanks,

                            Ric (newbie-at-large)

Sorry if this is a FAQ:

Is there a way to display the comment field in the address book, or to add a
comment to the Full name field that does not get pulled in to the address as
a middle name?

We are creating a global address book by importing from our college phone book 
and it would be great if we could include things like phone number and depart-
ment.


Thanks for your help,

Right now I am using an experimental version of Pine 3.92 to sign some of
my messages.  I don't really want to go into alot of detail at this time,
since the interface is still very experimental and changing frequently. 
But the way it works right now, there are some new configuration variables
that allow you to invoke pgp if an incoming message is PGP signed or
encrypted.  It has another variable to specify a filter to pass the
outgoing message text through.  There will not be any direct dependence on
the PGP program itself, so alternatives can easily be substituted... 

No, I don't know when we will be releasing Pine 3.92...

Hi,  I used to have the same problem.  it all depends on your connection 
to the machine running pine (in my opinion).  for example, I was dialing 
into a Xyplex terminal server then telnet'ing to my Unix box.  I had to 
give the following commands at the Xyplex end before I telnet'ed over to 
the Unix workstation:

Xyplex> set port ansi
Xyplex> set telnet type signal request disabled

or something like that.  apparently the Ctrl-X and some others were being 
stripped out by the Xyplex until I issued those "set" commands.  use the 
"help" feature on the Xyplex to get more info on that second set command 
since I'm not exactly sure how it goes.

   I am running pine3.91 and when users print to attached-to-ansi there 
is always an extra page printed.  When using PCTCP VTW emulation, the 
extra page is blank.  When using Novell LANWorkplace, the extra page has 
"[4i" at the top.  How can I have it print just the message and not the 
extra page?  I am running on Solaris2.4.  When printing from a Sun 
workstation to the HP laserjet, I do not get the extra page.  TIA

Thanks for any tips.

Hi!  Does anyone know how to view .GIV files using Pine?  I thought I 
read somewhere in the literature that this could be done, but I can't 
find where I read it...

Please respond to me directly.

No, Pine does _NOT_ put in a Newsgroups: header unless it is posting the
message.  An Email-Only reply will not have a Newsgroups: header.

I agree.  That's *why* I like to wait.  When I go through my newsgroups
and list groups the first time each evening, I'm just trying to sort
out the wheat from the chaff.  When I go back later and have only a few
posts (selected earlier) to deal with, I can read the thread, study
the post I'm responding to, and write a more thoughtful response.  And
it helps me to have that post and the ones associated with it saved
to a folder.

I think it would be good advice not to set up a strawman so crudely.
Why do you insist that following up from a folder rather than from the
newsgroup somehow magically takes it out of context?  If you wait two
weeks, sure, but not if you wait a few hours or even a day or two.
Given some of the stuff I read, I'd think it would be a good idea for
most users *not* to post until they think about it some.

Hello,
   I'm running PINE 3.91 and have recently encountered a problem (new) 
when posting to newsgroups :
After the final prompting querry - "Posting message ....Really Post?
	it gives a 		   "Posting News ......."
 	followed by a short duration 
		"Error Posting Message :441 can't Parse DATE header"
Can anyone shed some light on this ?

Good idea.  But how can you differentiate between a private mail address
and a mailing list address?  If I wanted to receive my private mail at
pine-info@umich.edu, I could.

Do you want to have to answer "Is this message being sent to a mailing
list?" every time you send a message?

I'm using pine 3.91 on a news server (inn 1.4).  I can read news from nntp 
fine, but I would like to be able to read directly.  I have the 
news-collection =News *[] but it's a no go.  Do I have to specify where 
the active file and news spool dir is? How?

The good news is that bcc: is easy to find -- just press Ctrl-R for "rich 
header."  (You have to be in the header when you press it; otherwise, 
ctrl-r is the key for retrieving documents).

The bad news that bcc: probably doesn't do what you want it to. 
Everything that's written on bcc: is invisible to the people on the To: 
and Cc: lines.  That's a what a blind copy means, invisible to the normal
addressees.  But the bcc: people are all visible to each other.  So if you
put the 400 name list in the bcc:, they'll still each get a 400 name
address list. 

I know, you want to know: what's the use of blind copies then?  It's 
mainly for lawyers.  You address to the other party, you copy their 
lawyer, and then you blind copy your co-lawyers, expert witnesses, etc.

Good luck with Eudora,

Michael

That is not correct. Sendmail does not do anything to the body of a
message. The routing information that sendmail and smail and other SMTP
mailers adds is in the headers.

Obviously, if their software is looking for recipient addresses in the
body of mail, it is not RFC 822 compliant.

Well, upon further investigation it appears that the problem is related
to the fact that the system that we're running on has short filesystem
names (limited to 14 characters).  (HP-UX supports long names, but we're
using 14 for "historical" reasons.)  What's happening is that the
locking routine bezerk_lock() tries to create a pair of lock files
linked together, but the second creation fails because the name is not
unique at the point where the additional info is tacked onto the
original file name.

Has anyone else run into this problem, and if so, is there a simple
solution (other than converting to long filenames)?

Also the Pine FAQ talks about strategies you can use in Pine to deal
with incoming folders.  Both the Pine FAQ and the Filtering Mail FAQ
are accessible from:

In not all but in some of the text sent out over a mailing list for which 
I use a mail alias I get these funny end of line "=20" characters. I 
don't see them at another site where I also use PINE, but others have 
mentioned it. Curiously it only occurs occasionally. Reformatting seems 
to help somewhat but not entirely.. Is this something I can compensate 
for or is it a MIME incompatability at the receiver's site? Any ideas?

Yes.

A1) No.
---------- End Pine Filtering FAQ
:-)

But see Nancy McGough's Filtering FAQ, posted to news.answers with

 You have no control over these fields. They are automatically added
by each mail gateway your mail goes through (the sendmail program usually).
The problem lies in the sprintlink gateway.

 Well, try asking your friend if their mail gateway is RFC822
compliant. This is indeed a setup problem on their side.

Hi,
   This "newbie" seeking advice on the upgrading Procedure for Pine version
3.91 for Windows 3.1. Have saved the "zip" archive containing the distb.
but have not learned the correct commands for creating the new directory and
unpacking the archive using the PKUNZIP.EXE program. Can anyone provide 
these?

          Many thanks,
                        Ric

Subject: INSTRUCTIONS: How to set up Pine for rimap under Solaris 2.4 and NIS+
Date: 24 Mar 1995 22:51:54 GMT
Message-Id: <3kviea$mff@news.missouri.edu>

I have figured out how to configure Solaris 2.4 running NIS+ and Pine so that
users may access an imapd server without having to provide their password yet
not compromising the security of the imap server machine.

I hope that these instructions are useful to someone.  Perhaps this will go in
the FAQ.

You may also contact me if you have problems compiling Pine under Solaris.

0) Install /etc/rimapd

1) Reconfigure the Solaris nsswitch.conf
   The OS must know how to treat login requests.  We use NIS passwd entry
   rewriting to ensure the login security of the server machine.  Thus we
   must tell the OS to use NIS-style lookups.

   Edit /etc/nsswitch.conf on the computer running the imapd server.
   Replace the "passwd: [files] [nis] [nisplus]" line with:

passwd: compat
passwd_compat: nisplus

2) Tell the imap server machine about the machines that will be requesting
   remote logins

   Edit /etc/hosts.equiv and add the names of the trusted hosts:

host1.your.domain
...
hostn.your.domain

3) Configure /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow to filter NIS+ password entries
   This is where the security measures are made.  We "rewrite" password
   entries for users not in /etc/passwd, giving them a different shell -
   /etc/rimapd - which allows rlogin, but not shell access.

   Append this line to /etc/passwd:
+:x:-1:-1:::/etc/rimapd

   Append this line to /etc/shadow:
+::-1::::::

And you are done!

I would be happy to field questions about this procedure.

Regards,

David

Agreed absolutely.  Headers that I have seen suggested in recent months
include:

     Also-Posted-To:
     Also-Cc-To:

>But if I want to be able to do a newsgroup response

Agreed, sort of.  It's not of critical importance.  I have never had
any trouble posting to Usenet something I got in email, or sending by
email something I posted to or got from Usenet.  It's a simple matter
of using one's editor to include the appropriate text in the
appropriate outgoing email message or Usenet posting.  Thus, although
it would be nice to have this done automatically, it's not really an
issue in the context of "Why did my private email get posted to
Usenet?"

There are many different things people like to do.  It would be too
painful a user interface if there were an option to do each
automatically.  For example:

- sign a message with PGP, send via email to a specific recipient,
  also post to a local newsgroup with the annotation, "I'm emailing
  this last warning to XXX.  Let's give him three days, then we should
  consider suing him."
- sign a file with PGP, use shar to create a shar archive of this along with
  some other files, add a Checksum: header with brik, post the final
  shar to Usenet, and send a copy to a colleage via email with the
  annotation, "hi, here's something I just posted to Usenet that might
  be of interest to you, give me a call at xxx-xxxx if you have trouble
  extracting this".
- get 'man csh' online, cut out a few lines, include in a reply to
  somebody's email, and also include a few lines from a Usenet
  posting in the same reply

There are simply too many things one might wish to do that result in
email being sent or News being posted.  Ideally an orthogonal user
interface will let the user combine activities as needed, instead of
trying to present all the options in a menu or querying the user each
time about what he wants to do.

I don't think Pine does this.  The Newgroups: headers are mostly
generated by trn (and perhaps other newsreaders) and they are
included whether the email copy is a CC: added with the post
(which I think is a nice convenience) or a private reply.  The
latter case is the problem, and to solve it we need a real standard
to distinguish the cases.

I,  Clarence Dold (dold@rahul.net) snivelled:

I did not delineate that I was sending mail to "clarence", and had not
specifically tried "clarence@nvts.com", although pine seemed to expand to
that as it filled in the "Full" name of the recipient.

Andrew Josey (andrew@novell.co.uk) wrote:

Oh, no, not an existing document!!  I hate it when I miss the notes that
apply to me, when scanning through stuff like this.

: A. Add an entry to /etc/mail/mailcnfg
: %d=mydom.com

I have a line that has DOMAIN=nvts.com.  Did I misread this somewhere, or
are two lines required, one DOMAIN, and the other %d?

: If you have the nuc package installed , edit /usr/lib/mail/mailsurr.proto
: # Map all names of the form user@domain
: '.+'  '(.+)@%d'    'Translate R=\\1'   #This is the added entry for user@domain

This was missing from mine.

: Then run the script /usr/lib/mail/surrcmd/createSurr.

Now all seems well.  I have sent from pine to clarence and
clarence@nvts.com, and they both appeared immediately, and without the added
Internet system header lines.

elm didn't appear sensitive to this, so elm must do its own checking of the
local domain.  I thought the fix was a pine-specific fix.

Thanks.

Hi friends,
As you know, "spell" is a proprietary software of AT&T and one
can not get it freely. So far I find pine or pico only
recognize spell. Ispell is free and much better than spell,
if you know how to make pine/pico work under ispell please
help. Thanks.

Say what?

Pine has never done this.  It's technically impossible for Pine to do so, 
since the presence of the Newsgroups data in a composed message is in 
itself a request to post to news.

Hi,

I am having a similar problem w/ Pine on my Linux system.

Everytime I try and open my folder (incoming mail), I get the following 
error:
	Can't get write access to folder, access is read only.
	Folder open, Failed. Abort: Permission denied.

The strange thing is that my sent-mesages box works fine. And moreover, 
everything was working fine on my system for nearly a week and just 
started when I was in root mode. All the old accounts that I had set up 
for my friends show the same problem: I am told that access is read only 
for just the INBOX while the other boxes work fine.

Why did this problem come up only now? Why does this problem persist even 
when I reboot the whole system?

Thanks.

Muhammad

Barry misunderstood you.  You weren't going to send out UK-ASCII.  But
you could send out ISO-646-GB which is the MIME label (RFC 1700) for
that old British standard 4730.  My users would be able to read that.

In a previous article, FLAVELL@cernvm.cern.ch (Alan J Flavell) says:

>[...]  PINE

>encodings on the wire (as declared in the header) and at the other

    To avoid further misunderstanding, let me point out that Pine
has no routines for translating a particular character set as defined
in incoming mail, or outgoing mail for that matter, to a different
character set of a display device.  Pine simply passes through all
data as the 8-bit characters they are.

    It would be nice if one could configure the display charset and the
trnasport (mail) character set differently, but that would add quite a
bit of extra code and tables to translate from one charset to another.

    In other words, with Pine, the only way to see the correct characters
that are intended to be sent is for the sending device to match the
display device.  (Probably PC-Pine has some translation, unless I'm
thinking of Kermit which supports a variety of code pages and charsets.)

    The charsets that should be used for mail, and thus those for which
Pine should be configured, are outlined in RFC1700, although use of
regional variants of ISO 646 is deprecated in favor of ISO 8859-1 which
covers a wide variety of western European languages.

    If your character set doesn't match that with which the mail was set,
you'll see some characters wrong -- like the British pound for the US
$ dollar sign with your UK-ASCII, or the currency symbol (sorta a cross
between o and x) on the otherwise-US-ASCII Tesla VT100 clones I used in
Slovakia.  Anyone want to volunteer to write code to perform translation
from a mail MIME charset to a different display charset?  It would be
very useful...

    Pine uses the character set you define in the configuration to tag
the message for the recipient.  When you receive mail with a different
tagging, Pine cautions you that some characters may be different, but
goes ahead and passes the characters to your display.  It would be up
to you, if possible, to change your charset to match that specified in
the incoming mail, which is relatively easy to do if running X with an
escape sequence.

    Any volunteers to write code to send X sequences to change the font
used when differently tagged mail comes in?  There are a variety of
MIME-useful charset fonts available from
ftp://ftp.vszbr.cz/pub/X11-fonts/   or
ftp://ccsun.tuke.sk/pub/font-archive/X11/
for people running X desiring support for additional languages...

Ok, so where (for example) an nn user would simply highlight some
postings on his screen, you are actually making separate physical
copies of them to achieve the same goal.  if so, this is not too bad,
though it does seem like a waste of resources.

Because making a physical copy of a posting seems an odd way of
"selecting" it.  Are we considering "selecting" postings synonymous
with "saving" them?

[T]rn both allow users to save articles in folders in mailbox format.

Both rn and trn do. When they save an article in mailbox format, they
retain ALL news headers, and create one of their own called Article:.
E.g., "Article: 21134 of comp.mail.misc"

Which checking this, I noticed that the From_ header that trn creates
is WRONG. It is missing a space before the date.

The only place that could know for sure that something was posted AND
mailed is the source. The source cannot know positively that something
was not posted. Assuming that it was not would be an error on the safe
side.

But this leaves us back at the destination being the one creating the
flag. (The source can only tell us what it thinks will happen; the
destination can tell us how the article actually arrived.) And, since
trn already creates this flag, maybe others should follow suit.

Trailing space(s) when mail is transmitted in qp mode.  But if the
recipient is using a MIME-compatible reader they will not see these.
qp encoding is only seen by s/one viewing the raw MIME.

Trailing space(s) alone would not cause PINE to use QP encoding,
I think.  But if it uses qp encoding for some other reason, it
will encode trailing spaces in this way.

Don't do whatever it is that you are doing to put PINE into qp mode ;-)
Somewhere in that MIME is likely to be some other =xx encoding or
other reason for PINE to have chosen to use qp encoding.
 
>or is it a MIME incompatability at the receiver's site?
 
Sounds as if the receiver does not use a MIME-compatible mail
client.

Please don't say that, it's so irritating!  We all have ideas,

Hello, everyone.
 
I'm using Pine v. 3.89, and I can't find any documentation explaining 
each of the variables under the "feature-list" command.  I know 
they're listed (but not discussed) in 3.89's .pinerc file, and they're 
spelled out in the setup menu of 3.91, but where can their 
explanations be found in 3.89?  I've checked the help for the main and 
setup menus and also the release notes, and no joy.
 
Thanks for all help.

There is no need to wait for a formal standard.  This simple rule will
suffice to avoid the problem being discussed:

   If a message has no Path: header, post no News follow-ups to it.

This is not true. (At least in Pine 3.91). Private (email) replies
to usenet articles from Pine do not include the "Newsgroups" header.
So, you couldn't send a reply to the usenet without manually, inserting
the Newsgroups value with pine.

I tried to use the Bounce command you have in Pine in my Elm filter and

What I want to do is filter certain messages to another account, but have

Procmail do this?

How can I configure PC pine to do this?  Keep in mind that I need to have 
"userid" as "rsingh", to be able to connect via IMAP server.  Also, how 
can I configure PCpine not to ask user name, machine and password everytime?

Thanks a lot.

Gauls!  We have nothing to fear; except perhaps that the sky may fall

Since you asked, I think it's an awful idea....whenever I'm testing out a 
new newsreader hack, it hangs up on "subscribe newsgroup alt.fan.foo" or 
some such (for we all know what a pain it is to run an ls -lt against 
the index of newsgroup files) until I go in and answer no to the 
question with my old newsreader (tin).

Requires it to be changed by the person who didn't know/care about
the problem.  Seems unlikely to happen whether it is the "right"
solution or not.

Umm, no.  It just requires that the user delete the Newsgroups: header
while he has it in his editor along with the text that he is motivated
to keep private.  But, the programs can be changed too, if someone
is motivated to do so.

I assume the other part of the "EITHER" is to postpone, export the 
message you are working on, then forward the other message and include 
the interrupted message (the same thing as what you do above, but in 
reverse).

I think you are at the limit of what you can do as far as file inclusion
goes with what you describe above.  However, I think it would be an excellent
addition to PINE if it had the following feature inside Compose:

	Upon hitting ^R, instead of just being able to include a file, or 
to browse through your directory list for a file, you would also have 
options to include

	(a) the message you are responding to,
	(ii) a message number in the current folder, or 
	(3) you could browse through different folders 
	(including the postponed-messages folder!)
	to select a message to ^R[ead] in.

But I don't see these feature being added too soon, unless I hear 
differently from one of the other people reading this ;) ...

With regard to that second item you mentioned, maybe there needs to be a "P" 
flag to indicate that an answering message has been postponed.

Sorry I couldn't help you directly, but maybe someone else can!

Alphabetical by login id of sender (not alias).  It also ignores case.

Michael,
I take it you are a lawyer.  <g>

In fact, bcc is used people in the business world, too.  In industry we
have project teams that need to be informed of correspondence with
customers or vendors.  At the same time, we don't want to send the
outsiders the list of team members, because we want to limit the number of
authorized points-of-contact or because the list would unnecessarily 
clutters up the letter, for example.

Where can I get MIME tools for myself and my friend in Germany. Seflin 
freenet automatically encodes binary files when uploaded in my Home File 
directory; but they cannot be decoded nor viewed even when uudecoded with 
the tool available in Seflin. MIME tool might just do the trick for me 
and my friend as he uses Unix uudecode unsucessfully.
Thanks.

How about this variation:

If a message is not a news posting, be sure it doesn't have a Newsgroups:
header.

If you are sending private mail as a reply within trn and want to
make sure the recipient doesn't accidentally post it, delete the
Newsgroups: line while it is still in your editor.  Since the
problem seems to be related to someone who knows/cares about the
difference between news and mail sending to someone who doesn't,
I think there is a lot better chance of having the person who knows
and cares do the fixing, which is simple enough in the case of
newsreaders that dump the headers in your edit file.

I sent this message once before, but may have confused people by putting 
''.GIF'' in the subject header and ''.GIV'' in the body text.  

Anyway, I would like to know if it is possible to view and/or mail .GIF 
files using Pine.  If it is possible, with which version of Pine?

Second, I would like to know if it is possible to direct incoming 
messages by filtering the ''From:'' line...

Please mail any responses directly to me, as I am not on the pine-info list.

Requires changing lots of user agents, among them trn and tin (perhaps

I'd appreciate some help - thanks!

	The problem I have is E-mailing 4-5,000 addresses updates of my
latest goods for sale.
	I understand there are programs called listserv and listproc that 
do this well but I've searched and searched and can't find them.

	I need a loop program that will send these out in a staggered way 
so as not to clog my Access Provider. I am on a SUN system and use PINE 
usually.
	I need just a few parameters. The prog. itself, the name of the 
distrib. list and the file to be sent.
	I've had about 15 programs that were hoped to have worked but the 
only one that ever did was from a crl, my provider, employee who did it 
on the side for me and I can't go back to him.
	The prog. he wrote sent the mail out indeed, but it also sent out 
my file to the nickname, the last name and the first name of the client 
before getting to the last line in my .addressbook and sending it out as 
well.
	This created hundreds/thousands of bounced mail which crl had to 
got through by hand. Since an E-mail using only a single name, such 
as John, will default to a crl address I also seemed to have been sending 
E-mail to every customer crl has!
	Crl dropped my access without word to me at that point but I made 
it right until I next err. The next time this happens I'll lose my 
connection with crl permanently.
	As I am not a programmer and very poor at techy things I need a 
program that will work without further tinkering by me.
	To test it you could use the test file I've enclosed and create 
in your .addressbook a distrib. list with my address typed in 3 X.
	Boy, I don't ask much, do I?

	Below or attached are various attempts by others to help me.
	Perhaps some would even work if I was using the correct chmod.
	I've used a+x a+u but that prob. doesn't mean much.
	Your kind help will be forever remembered by me.
	Thanks for even reading the above.
	Best, John

I've just download PC-PINE and have noticed that it requires an IMAP server.
I noticed that there is an imapd binary that came with the unix
distribution.  Our MIS department has never heard of IMAP and doesn't know
how to set up an IMAP server.  Can somebody point me to a faq/web page that
describes the process.  I would really like give people here at a work an
alternative to CC:Mail.

On a related issue. 
Does anyone have a good description of tools and formats that are
commonly used for converting binary files to ascii for transfer.
Something that would be good for a Help Desk person to have to help
recognize an encoded mail message.
And pointers to the tools, for instance binhex for unix, off-line mime
conversion, etc.

Message-Id: <3l70mi$br9@gate.sinica.edu.tw>

    It would probably be a lot easier to add xterm mouse capability
into the next version of Pine instead of hacking out a full GUI.  I
think this would be a popular item among the growing number of people
who run FreeBSD or NetBSD or Linux at home and XFree86 as the
windowing system.  Very changes would have to be made to the existing
interface and the mouse support would be completely transparent to
those using Pine on a text console or over a VT-100 dialup.  Look at
strn, mc and utree as examples.

    How about it, Pine people?

Is there any reasonable way to look at the comment field of
addressbooks? The only way I found so far was to try to edit it. It
would be nice To have something like a 'wide' view of addressbooks
which shows also the fcc and comment fields.

Subject: Bug? Removing Incoming folder *deletes* folder...
Date: 28 Mar 1995 14:14:48 GMT
Message-Id: <3l95ko$840@piston.ecp.fr>

  This is with Pine 3.91. I had an Incoming Folder that I wanted to 
remove from this list. So I selected Delete, but this did actually
*physically* remove my folder!
  I think there is a bit of inconsistence in the interface: I can create
an incoming folder with Pine, but if I want to remove it from the
Incoming folder list *without* actually deleting it I have to edit 
manually .pinerc.
  Could this be changed in a future release?

Subject: Use Fcc also for incoming mail?
Date: 27 Mar 1995 09:09:14 GMT
Message-Id: <3l5vbq$fsi@nx2.hrz.uni-dortmund.de>

Would it be possible to use the folder defined in the fcc field of the
addressbook also for incoming mail? I would find this very useful
because I would like to have incoming and outgoing mail for the same
correspondant in one folder.

I realise that it wouldn't be completely trivial to implement. As far
as I can see, the only way pine now retrieves information from the
addressbook is by nickname. One would have to add a mechanism for
lookup-by-address. It can be done, the MUA I used to use under VM/CMS
has this feature.

I'm trying to download messages from my newsgroups into my home directory 
so I can then download to my PC (a task i have already conquered) but 
when I export the messages to a text file, they end up in limbo.  I've 
heard something about a .rtin directory ?  What is that and how do I use 
it, and where does it go?

Thanks

I too would like to know if there is any way to get pine to decode BINHEX 
attachments.

I have lots of friends using Macs & PCs who send BINHEX attachments to me 
(I use unix) that I can't access.  (Or can I?)  Can anyone help?

By the same token, most of them claim they can't access attachments that 
I send them.

	I'm running PINE 3.91 under Sol 2.3 and I'm having trouble piping
multiple articles to a unix command.  If I pipe them one at a time, the
pipe seems to be working correctly.
	I select the articles I want uudecode, then I do an apply | and
enter uudecode.  What I get back is a message telling me that there's been
an error in piping the articles.  As I said, if I only pipe one article it
works fine, but there are an awful lot of posts that are multi-part and I
end up having to save (which works fine so I don't think its an aggregate
command problem) and then uudecode manually.
	Is this a bug, a feature, or do I need further education?

Does anyone know of a way to configure PINE 3.91 to automatically forward
incoming mail to another internet address.  I have heard that there is
something like ".FORWARD" that you can put in your address book but I have
no specifics.  If not does anyone know if this can be done on a unix
server before the message ever gets to PINE?

Please reply to LesR368767@aol.com or lrockwel@neptune.esc.k12.in.us

Thanks

Can you give an example of how, for example, I'd add in a type for an
Excel spreadsheet (file extension .XLS) so that if I asked to View that
file it would pull up excel as the viewer?  I understand the basics of
the mailcap file, but I don't understand how to add a new mime type so
that when the file is attached to the message, Pine knows to specify the
type as (for example) "application/excel".

Thanks....

While Pine is planning to include support for PGP and the like in then 
next release, I was wondering if anyone has come up with a workaround for 
*nix type systems and if you would please forward any and all hints to me 
at the below address.

Thanks!

The .forward file goes in your home directory; format varies.  SVR4 uses 
the address to which you want your mail forwarded, i.e. 
lesr368767@aol.com.  The mail agent uses this file, so it never gets to PINE.

We have a desire for a simple, easy to use mail interface (such as pine), 
without the openings for SAVING mail, importing, exporting, changing the 
"To:/CC/BCC" fields, so that when handed an address on the command line, 
that is who the mail will be going to...ONLY.

Has anyone done this? Attempted this.  I looked a bit, and couldn't seem 
to get the menu options to appear correctly if I disabled the keys :(.  
We are presently using 3.89, but a version of 3.9x that does this would 
also be a nice addition.

Suggestions?  Help?

Quick question: I just started using Pine. It has it's limitations
but it is rather useful. My question is, how do I link in
an external editor. I'd much rather us vi than the default
editor. I chnaged the value under the setup/config
to 'vi' but i wont start it up when I compose or reply to
a message. Any ideas? Help!

Does pine support the elm and ucb mail features of being able to *NOT*

We presently (about a hundred Macs) use MS Mail clients on the Macs with a
MS Mail server running on a Mac. Microsoft dropped the ball and we haven't
found anyone willing to pick it up (for less than a large sum of money).
We will move to Pine via telnet and just suffer without the local file
access for a while. We may work out a way for users to access their home
directory on the Unix server via NFS to the Mac desktop which will help a
little. So far, we haven't seen a Mac IMAP/MIME client fully realized.
Mail Drop from Baylor is a start but feels like alpha code to me. 

If Pine were ported to the Mac, I don't think it would really be Pine
necessarily because the interface could be completely different. There's
no need for a menu structure matching Pine's. The way I would envision
things would be a Chooser system extension for accessing IMAP services. 
Within the Chooser, one selects an IMAP and SMTP server, username/id, and
password. I think the IMAP4 spec would come into play very well for this
(send via IMAP and folder collection information? can't remember). When
connected, you would see something similar to an HFS storage device on the
desktop. Inside would be folder collections. Here's the catch. Now you add
a system extension (to System 7.5+) that adds a file type of Electronic
Mail to the system (type='MIME' perhaps) and handles MIME interpretation.
This would allow email messages (documents) to appear as Electronic Mail
under the Kind column of listings. Now you can drag email messages from
your IMAP storage window (which looks just like any normal Finder window)
to a disk to store messages there. To create or send email, the New
command (in the IMAP storage window) creates a new empty email message.
When creating or viewing messages, a Mail menu would be appended to the
menu bar containing options to Send, Forward, Reply, etc. or some such
features. Documents of type Electronic Mail could contain all the MIME
types and would be presented and handled in an appropriate Finder-like
fashion. 

Roll all this into OpenDoc, Drag-and-Drop, threaded news reader, Web
browser, and toaster, then you're talking a pretty cool package. 

Of course, this could be done on a System 6 machine using an 
Application/Extension as well. But then, everyone's using System 7.5 
anyway, right?

	As far as I know, there is not a version of pine which runs on a
macintosh.  Since pine runs purely as text, however, it can be run on
pretty much any remote unix machine with your mac serving as a dumb
terminal.  That is what we do all the time. If you have a 14.4k modem, the
operation is pretty seemless. 2400 cps is slow, though. Over ethernet, it
should be as good as running anything locally on the mac, unless your
ethernet backbone is highly overtaxed. If you are determined to have a
program running locally on your mac and your mac has an ethernet
connection to the internet, you can also use a mailtool from
ftp.cac.washington.edu /mail/mac/Mailstrom_1.05.hqx. Since our macs
are not ethernetted to the main system, I haven't checked this program out
thoroughly, but it looks nice. (It doesn't work over a modem.  If, as you
say, you use telnet, then it should work for you.) You might also check 
to see if NCSA has anything.

Ok, maybe I deserve a "newbie slap" but in the year Ive been using pine 
3.xx I don't remember seeing a "select" in the folder index. Of course I 
tend not to read help pages unless its a last resort. I cant be that 
simple...

Cc: jjl@ichips.com

I have recently installed PINE for sun PC-NFS on a DOS 6.22 GATEWAY PC.
PC pine version 3.91 using PC-NFS 4.0.  Using imap-3.6.BETA congifured for
Sun.

Setup
- I have setup pop pop3 and imap on a host system called "ichips" running
  SUNOS 4.1.3.
- I have no problem with unix pine or unix mtest to access {ichips}inbox.
  Pine comes back with a user id and requests the password properly.
- PC-NFS is configured properly for the entire network and has access to all
  the systems using the NIS host database for the PC in question.

Problem
- PC Pine returns an error message [Host not found:  ichips]
  followed by [No folder opend].  The PC can ftp and telnet to ichips 
  without any problems but does not recognize ichips as the host.
  I tried the inbox parameter with {ichips}inbox and {ip-address}inbox with
  no success.

Might anybody have a possible solution to this problem?

Hi there : 
  I have set up a line regarding to mpeg file format in my .mailcap file.

# This maps MPEG video DATA to the viewer ' mpeg_play'.
video/mpeg; mpeg_play %s

 After I attach the mpeg file to send it to myself, I cant view the 
attachment in the pine 3.91 on Sun solarsis.
I get the following error message
 Application/OCTET-STREAM

Cant pine recognize the mpeg header and attach the a header like video/mpeg?

Somebody help me!

Regards.

I think you're meaning to file '.addressbook' in your own directory.
Please you check that file where addresses saved & load.

Subject: How to eliminate NNTP NOOPS from pine
Date: 28 Mar 1995 22:28:56 GMT
Message-Id: <JBRYANS.95Mar28142855@tern.csulb.edu>

When used as a newsreader, pine shouts NOOP at the NNTP server every
2 1/2 minutes to circumvent the server's inactivity timeout policy.

INN defaults to a generous 2 hour inactivity timeout.  As I recall,
reference nntp has a similarly liberal timeout default.  That covers bnews,
cnews, and INN, the vast majority of newservers that don't need timeout
circumvention, and are ill served by it.  Users of the most popular
newsreaders rightfully wouldn't tolerate a server that required user action
every 2 1/2 minutes to prevent the delay of reconnection.  Pine's status as
a superb MUA doesn't qualify it for special dispensation as a newsreader.

In several comp.mail.pine followups in a thread started by my asking how to
build pine without NNTP NOOPs, Mark Crispin <mrc@CAC.Washington.EDU> wrote:

Yeah, right.  There's no protocol associated with named and ntp, and I just
fell off the turnip truck.

Yes NNTP is in disarray.  All the more reason for dialog between client
writer/maintainers and server writer/maintainers.  The widely recognized
client NNTP extensions came about either with the cooperation of server
writers, or by furnishing patches to reference nntp.  Unilateral protocol
extension isn't a positive contribution.

The days of open NNTP servers have been over for years.

Each newsreading connection takes a process slot and real and virtual
memory.  On our system these are finite resources.  Sure, one NNTP
connection that refuses to timeout is no big deal, but when you have
thousands of newsreading connections/day, inactivity timeouts are necessary
to keep the server responsive for all users.  The newsreaders I'm familiar
with reconnect to the server when the user resumes newsreading after a
timeout.

Then we're in good company with sendmail, ftp, and named.

Fine.  Please add the following patch for the next release of pine.  It
defaults to present behavior for the minority that want it that way, but
provides a way for the rest of us to turn off NNTP NOOPs.

I am using one. It is simple to build if you have a compiler available.

If you cant get one, mail me.

I've got my configuration set to show news group messages in order of 
arrival. How is it that when I view a news group I see all ranges of dates 
interspersed? For example, I posted a message on lang.comp.c++, when out 
of pine and back in to verify that it was posted and could not find my 
message at the bottom of the list. I did a search and found it about 60 
messages up. How am I to understand this?

Thanks.

Yes, if the author of pine knew and cared about the problem, it would
have been fixed already.

Pine Clones,

Would someone point me to a LIST for cc:Mail or general e-mail issues

	The .forward function is not part of pine. It is a function common
to most unix systems and is probably present whether or not pine is
installed. I believe that it is usually a part of sendmail. Anyway, if you
have a standard unix account (I have no idea about aol.com) then simply
placing a text file in your home directory called .forward should do the
trick. For your purposes, the file, .forward, should be a file solely
comprised of the e-mail address that you want your mail forwarded to. 
Existing mail in your inbox will remain there, but all new mail will show
up in the address specified in the .forward file.  I think the easiest way
to set this up is to type the following line at the unix prompt: 

	echo "you@new.address" > ~/.forward

So, if you want all of your mail to go to me, for example, (I don't 
suggest that you actually do this as I don't want your mail,) the line 
would look like this:

	echo "iano@scripps.edu" > ~/.forward

To stop your mail from forwarding, delete the .forward file. This can be 
done by typing:

	rm ~/.forward

(It may ask you whether or not you really wish to delete the file. Answer 
yes.)


	I hope this helps. The .forward is fairly versatile and can do a
great deal more than simply forward your mail. Read the manpages (man mail
or man sendmail) for more information.

Disclaimer: 
	1) The procedure for doing this with PC-Pine on an IBM/Intel clone
	is likely very different. I don't really do DOS, so the above only
	applies to unix systems. 

	2) I take no responsibility if following my suggestions results in 
	your name being placed in the FBI's top ten most wanted list, the loss 
	of any limbs by either your pet or yourself or any other similarly
	dire consequence. Believe what you read on the internet at your
	own risk.

Subject: "@" breaks WinPine 3.91 when typed on Compose window

Dear Pine Developers:

We have been using Pine for Windows as the primary mail application at 
our campus, but we are being bitten by an irksome bug.

Whenever you type an ampersand in the Compose window, be it as part of 
the text or as part of an address, Pine starts misinterpreting spaces as 
carriage returns. In other words, if you should happen to type an 
ampersand (@) for any reason, from there on whenever you press the 
spacebar you get a carriage return, and you cannot get spaces anymore.

We are primarily using Windows 3.1, Peter Tattam's Winsock, v.2, MS-DOS 6, 
on a variety of machines.

Is there a workaround for this bug, or a planned bugfix release ? Having 
to postpone, exit WinPine and return, in order to continue using spaces 
is quite a drag.

Thanks for your help.

I have several large folders produced by either /usr/ucb/mail and/or elm. 
Now I want to read them using pine 3.91. However, pine can't figure out
who the original sender of each message was. Instead, it prints the index
something like.. 
                                                       
+   1   xxx -1 To: Byers <bob@hsph>   (812) test msg#1 
+   2   xxx -1 To: Byers <bob@hsph>  (1024) wet sprocket
+   3   xxx -1 To: Byers <bob@hsph>   (512) ack

As you can see, pine doesn't know who the original sender was. This is a
serious problem because using reply ("R") in pine doesn't fill in the
return address for me, it just leaves it blank. 

The folder has messages with the following pattern..

	From bill Fri Jan 7 16:34:12 1994
	Subject: wet sprocket
	To: Byers <bob@hsph>

I've discovered that if I insert a "Date:" and "From:" line _after_ the
original "From" line, all is OK, as far as pine is concerned. In other
words, the above pattern becomes.. 

	From bill Fri Jan 7 16:34:12 1994
	Date: Fri Jan 7 16:34:12 1994
	From: bill
	Subject: wet sprocket
	To: Byers <bob@hsph>

What is going on here? Is there any way to make pine happy with the
original folder? Or is my only hope to write a program to convert my
folders to the 2nd format? 

Thanks,

I get a message saying "Bug in Pine detected. Core dumped" frequently
(not always) when new mail comes in.

Anyone know why?

Why when I create a new incoming mail folder called something like
Mail/fwall.mbox does it also creates another folder called fwall.mbox.
I cannot delete this unless I touch ~/fwall.mbox and then delete
it.

Then... when I quit and restart Pine there it is again 8^}

I had this problem a while ago, and asked in this very forum if anyone
had a solution. I heard from a lot of people that had the same problem,
but not from anyone who either had a solution or had it working at all.
Eventually we gave up trying, and switched to PC-NFSpro and pcpine_w;
this combination works fine.

Brian,
It's always helpful if you mention which version of pine you are using.
This particular bug *sounds* like one that was introduced in 3.90 and fixed 
in 3.91...  

If it is happening with 3.91, use the bug report command and attach a
compressed core file or a stack trace.

I am not sure what excatly you want.  But if you want to find people's e-mail 
address, visit my home page at http://www.spd.louisville.edu/~m0zaud01/welcome.html   There u can find links to various netfind servers.  If you don't know how to use netfind servers don't worry, there is file that will explain how to use them in my page.

Hello!

A few day ago I download the Pine3.91 from ftp.cac.washington.edu.
At the moment I use version 3.89, many people tell me that this is a old one.
I use Linux and I do not know, if I download the right version for my
system. When I type in build --help then there are many systems, but I do 
not found Linux. And the readme file does not exists in the /doc.
But when I type build lnx then Pico build hisself. But it comes a error 
for Pine. Sorry when I can not perfect explain, I am new at Linux. :)
That bad thing is, that I can not remember what File I download. I think 
pine3.91.tar.Z
When there is a Pine Howto or FAQ then please send me the File. But one 
is enough ;-)

Anyone with a Mac who wants a MIME compliant mail client can get a
free one from <ftp://ftp.qualcomm.com/mac/eudora/1.5/> called Eudora.
There's also a commercial version of Eudora that many people swear by
which has (naturally enough) more features than the free version.
Eudora uses POP for incoming mail and SMTP to a server for outgoing.
There is an SMTP server (Mailshare) that can be used with Eudora if
you're in a pure SMTP environment (on a LAN, for example).  Hunt in
the usual Mac archives (Sumex and Umich, mirrored at many places
including wuarchive.wustl.edu, see the Mac FAQ's for more sites) for
Mailshare.  There's also a pure SMTP client called Leemail, but I've
never used it.

I use the free version of Eudora on my Mac at home over a PPP
connection, and pine on my Sun workstation.  I personally would never
want pine on my Mac.

This is strange!  My hostname is penny.n2wx.ampr.org, but I have
n2wx.ampr.org CNAMEd to it and wish to use the shorter version on
my outgoing email.

For some reason 3.91 ignores my user-domain setting and it also disregards
the use-only-domain-setting when I tried that.

3.91 happily uses a user-domain parameter that differs from my hostname.

Is this intentional action?

I don't know if anybody has mentioned this in the past, but the OpenVMS
port of PINE (the HUJI one) crashes/burns if there is no mail folder
in existance upon startup. (happens with PTMAIL, an ELM clone for VMS
too, actually!)
Of course, it's easy to create the e-mail file simply by sending the
user some mail and letting the O/S create it - but it would be nice
if PINE reported something rather than just stack dump.

Message-Id: <3knpii$70a@lionheart.dce.vic.gov.au>


Greetings!

Is it possible to set Pine up so that it reads from and saves to folders
which are stored in a different area to where Pine operates from?

The reason I ask is because we have what are known as 'home' directories
where Pine operates from, but the sytem manglers are limiting space in
each user's home directory to 1MB. (The 'hidden' system files take up at least
half that!!! grrrr)
Anyway, Pine looks in our home directories for the inbox and for the mail
folders we create to store correspondence, which, obviously takes up room.
So I was wondering if there was a way of setting Pine up so that it would
store the mail directory (which holds the folders and inbox) elsewhere
and read from this remote area to avoid taking up 'precious' space in our
home directories.

Any suggestions please email directly to me, as I don't read the newsgroups
often, and I like filling up my home directory with mail to annoy the
system manglers. ;)

Thanks

Darren

In other words, when I press L, I'd like to see only a list of my

I want to use functionkeys instead of the control-keys.

(1) Is this only possible by using the commandline option -k ?
(Ofcourse I can change the source ...)

(2) When I call "pine -k" it displays as expected the F1 etc in the menu 
line, but when a functionkey is pressed, I got the following error:

	Command "D" notdefined for this screen. Use F1 for help

I love these clear messages, but the F1 produces the same error !

Help can still be called with "?" and some other keys are also still 
working: ctrl-{G,W,Y,V} <SPACE> "-".

What's causing this PAIN with our friend PINE ?

The reason I would be interested in a Mac IMAP client, is simply because
for a lot of users here, POP is no a viable solution. They either do not
have enough hard disk available or they are using dial in to access their mail
and bringing all their mail down to their Mac simply doesn't hack it.

For these people I suggest (and distribute) Mailstrom. However the most
current release has some bugs in it. Especially in the TCP code. I have
work arounds for them, but would like a newer and less buggy app. 

I have tried the various beta releases of ECSMail, but have found them
to be even less stable than Mailstrom. And now it seems that V2 of Mailstrom
is a dead issue. This is too bad as it was looking pretty good. (kind of wish
I could get a hold of v2a15 source..oh well). 

We do have a few people that use Eudora, but they are all Ethernet connected
and have very large Macs with large hard drives.

Right now the best freeware app looks to be Mail Drop. The only things it seems
to be missing is multiple mailboxes and a way to directy insert text besides
cut and paste (a minor issue I grant you). I am keeping a I on this one.

But yes, a Pine Like app would be very nice to have for the Mac.

I just discovered the function key option yesterday and tried playing 
with it.  I think that your problem may be with terminal configuration 
and whether PINE expects the ASCII sequences sent by your function keys.

I log in as a vt100 from an AT&T 605 terminal and my default function key 
definitions don't work.  

As a vt100 terminal, PINE is expecting F1=\EOP, F2=\EOQ, F3=\EOR, and
F4=\EOS.  (This info is from the termcap file.) If you type the sequence
<esc>OP you will get the PINE help menu for the function key-based
operation.  HOWEVER, since the vt100 definition doesn't include F5 - F12,
I don't know how to program my function keys to satisfy PINE. 

Since the letter and control-key commands are easy to remember (mostly 
mnemonics), I'm not that interested in the function keys.

On some systems the .forward needs to be world readable and
your home directory needs to be world searchable
("executable").  Here's how you do that:

cd
chmod +x .
chmod 644 .forward

Make sure you test it out by having someone on a different
system send you a message.

Good luck,
Nancy

There may be a sendmail in the loop doing this for/to you.  It is common
for sendmail rewriting rules to canonicalize hostnames in header
addresses.  If it sees a n2wx.ampr.org it looks up the CNAME and replaces
it with the canonical name, penny.n2wx.ampr.org.  You might try changing
the DNS setup to fix this.  You could get rid of the CNAME, and use an MX
record for n2wx pointing to penny instead.  If you also need there to be
an IP address associated with n2wx, then you can add an A record with the
penny address for n2wx. 

A more difficult approach would be to modify your sendmail.cf to cause it 
to rewrite penny.n2wx.ampr.org to n2wx.ampr.org late in the rewriting 
process (after the [] resolver lookups are done).

I've been keeping tabs on this news group for a long time now, hoping to see
someone else ask this question, but haven't.  Hope this doesn't mean it's too
stupid to bring up . . .

How can I get PINE to work acceptably on a Wyse 50 terminal?  The docs
mention using a substitute for protected mode -- I don't know what that is.
I've tried all the hardware settings I can think of, with no good results.

Can someone tell me what to do?  I mean, specifically?  Or is this hopeless?

Thanks in advance.

Steve, I'm grateful for your advice.  It was much easier to take the second 
approach, rebuilding sendmail.cf from the .mc file.  A quick 
MASQUERADE_AS() declaration took care of the problem.

Thanks for your help!

I just got procmail to help me deal with some mailing lists, and
looked in the FAQ for setting up inboxes. Is there a patch yet to
somehow tag the inboxes with a newmail count? I've got "newmail"
to tell me as stuff comes in, but it's a bit of a drag scrolling back
through an xterm in the morning, or opening all the boxes in Pine to see
if they're empty.

We had this exact problem, although we are using PC-NFS v5.0w. The
solution appeared to be freeing up sufficient main memory: 560k.

I have a problem that when I use Pine 3.91 to mail to local users, it
looks up their address and sees that their .forward file is set to
mail to filter or procmail and then it bounces the message back to me.
Even though it bounces back and says it cannot deliver directly to
programs, the message actually gets sent through.  So here I am with
the message correctly delivered and a copy bounced back to me saying
that it didn't go through.  This happens to any user on the system
that uses pine and only pine.(Elm and mail work fine)  How do I get
rid of this feature/bug?

Does anyone know how to make the arrow keys work when using Pine on an 
IBM-clone - I have some students who cannot use the arrow keys and the 
alternate commands also do not seem to work. We are in a remote site 
where we cannot use a mouse to work with email editting, and putting in a 
command to go up a line or down a line seems absurd.
Thanks - Delena Norris-Tull

The script below is designed to work with WYSE terminals - Someone else 
wrote the original.

   Dear Pine supporter or User

   We at the Florida Solar Energy Center are an alternative energy 
center which is part of the University of Central Florida.  We would like 
some help in configuring Pine for VMS.  I have taken Pine 3.91 from an 
FTP site (ftp.ctrl-c.liu.se /vms/pine) but I need to find netlib so
that I can build it on my system.  I did find some netlibe stuff 
packaged with MX but I still do not see a standard VAX runtime library or 
netlibe.olb.  In short I am having trouble finding or putting together 
the pieces.  I would appreciate some advise and maybe a phone number.
