I am trying to find out how to make a nice signature file. Is this done 
by just using a editor(Pico) and painstaking making one or is thier a 
better way to make a nice one, like with a picture or image of something.
I see alot of nice sig. with things i could never make. If so could 
someone please tell me how or is there a FAQ on this

I suspect that the messages are being posted, but the auto replies
are not being sent to you because of your munged from line.
One workaround is to set 'user-domain' to postoffice.ptd.net
in the pine config.

I hate to tell you.  If I copy a mail message to a newsgroup they both
contain a To and Newsgroups but the mail will only have Received lines
but no Path and you will still want to follow up to all recipients.  I
also strip the longish Path when I save articles from within my news
reader that I want to followup to with my mail composer.

I have an unusal Question.  I opened up pine, (on a sun machine) after 
having used it for about ohhh, ever since they first came out with Pine 
3.91, but this evening when I started pine, it said welcome to a new 
verstion of Pine, 3.89

At first I though someone played a joke adn broke into my accout, so I 
exited but stared it up again aobut 1 min later.  I got teh same message 
but it said Pine 3.91.  Can anyone come up with a resonable explanation 
for this?

I am answering in the context of Yehavi's VMS port of PINE.  If you
are asking the question in a PMDF context, you will have to get the
correct answer from someone else.
 
PINE is a mail client, it does not process incoming mail until you
execute it.
 
On VAX/VMS systems, incoming mail is handled by the VMS MAIL system.
If you want your incoming mail forwarded automatically, you have to
set the VMS MAIL routines to do it for you.  PINE cannot do this, as
it does not see the incoming mail until you log on and execute PINE!
 
>From the VMS system prompt, issue the MAIL command, and at the
MAIL> prompt, issue a SET FORWARD command.
 
You will need to know the correct format for mail addresses on your
VMS MAIL system.  On mine it would be SMTP%"someuser@some.domain.edu"
for an Internet recipient.
 
Hope this helps.

RFC 1036 already defines that the "Newsgroups" line says where the
message was posted to.  I would tell procmail to automatically append
the Message-IDs of those mails to my killfile if I was stressed by
having to read the followups to my postings a second time in news.

You've proven it.  I cited this in the request I sent to my news gurus
to correct our trn MAILHEADER configuration so we use In-Reply-To
instead of the wrong Newsgroups in private emails.

I build pine 3.91 three days ago with gcc-264-050395 and everything went well.
lnx should be the right parameter for build.

I have a similar problem. I want to set the message-id to my domain name

Subject: Question: How to set a Forwarding Address - Pine for VMS
Date: Sat, 01 Apr 1995 00:27:42 GMT
Message-Id: <0098E30C.CFC075DF@pomona.edu>

Hi everyone,
	I've looked through the faq and the user guide and couldn't find the
answer.  I played with fcc settings in the pine.pinerc file.  All to no avail
...
here's what I want to do.  I want to have Pine automatically forward all my
mail to a different account, a different system, a different address.  How do I
do this?  I'm not sure that the command would be specific to VMS Pine, it may
be the same for all ...

Any help much appreciated.
Thanks!
Jan

Subject: Mail, News and Folders?
Message-Id: <noe.16.0051F10F@io.org>
Date: 27 Mar 95 09:30:44 GMT

Unfortunately, I now have 5 internet accounts and I'm trying to consolodate 
all my mail on one account.

I have one account with POP and IMAP servers so I can forward all my mail to 
this account and retreive it with a SLIP POP3 client at home and with PINE at 
the university. However, when I set my inbox to in pine it prompts me for a 
username and password.
I was hoping there is some way I can program PINE to enter my username and 
password automatically so I don't have to type them every time I check my mail.

I also have a similar problem with mail. The account I generally work from at 
the university doesn't have an NNTP server. I have another account that does 
have this but if I set up PINE for that NNTP server I am denied access. Is 
there some way to get pine to enter in a username and password for an NNTP 
server?

Finally, someone told me that you can set up PINE to automatically file new 
messages from a specific address to a specific folder (i.e. you can 
automatically save newslist messages to their own folders). Is this true, and 
if so, how do you do it?

Thanks for any help you can give me,

	Hi folx , 


	The Q is why ? I have Pine 3.91 on FreeBSD/SunOS 413/Sol 2.4.
	Frankly I don't care , since I use elm , but thousands
	of users do :(
	They love pine :) , and they can't use it from tin to
	(re)mail the article.
	Sure there are workarounds - like first saving the article to the file,
	or setenv MAIL elm - but they want it to work in normal way.

	And .. this is Unix for Gods sake !
	The ability of a program to accept its data from STDIN being redirected
	to open file (by shell) is one of _very basic concepts of Unices ...

	I help this article will cause a laugh at U of Wash., since
	it was fixed already ? :))

	And what's the official site for pine ? I tried to reach one
	mentioned at ftp.uu.net as be a primary , but wasn't able to
	resolve the name :
	ftp.cac.washington.edu: Host name lookup failure

	I would appr. pers. E-mail as well :)

In pine 3.91, I added a global addressbook from the 'S'etup 'C'onfig menu.

BUT if you want to modify the addressbook from pine after creating it 
then you need to implement it as a shared addressbook rather than a 
global addressbook.

I don't want to read them in mail.  I want to read them in news.

If you want me to reply in mail, mail it.  If you want me to reply in
news, post it.  Don't do both.

I ca'n't tell procmail to discard all mail with a Newsgroups: header
because Pnews uses it differently.

We're trying to run pine over an NFS mounted mail spool.  It
locks up and won't read the inbox.  It seems that there is some
problem with locking over NFS.  The FAQ and the archive don't
seem to have any solutions.  

Anyone else out there encounter this?

I am using popclient to download my mail from my internet provider to my 
Linux machine. The problem is that Pine (3.91) thinks my INBOX is locked 
any time I get mail. 

The only thing I have found in the docs is that the INBOX of one Pine 
session gets locked if another Pine session is invoked. I am not doing 
this. 

Does anyone know what Pine uses to determine if a mailbox is locked, so I 
can unlock it? I have looked in my lock directories and there is nothing 
there.

RFC 1036 doesn't apply to mail.

You don't get it. The statement dealt with dropping them from mail, not
from news. You see, some people think that recreational discussions should
take place in a recreational forum like news, and mail should be for
more important things.

Are there any plans on making Pine be able to read gziped mail files?
Or has any accomplished this with current versions of Pine?

Let's clarify:

If you are prone to accidentally post public responses to private
email, then the rule

   If a message has no Path: header, post no News follow-ups to it

will prevent such errors.  If you are not having any such problems, and
you are always sure about when it's appropriate to post a Usenet
response to private email, then you and your software can safely ignore
this rule.

Just to make sure I understand:  For some weird reason you don't like
  To: Mark Rafn <dagon@halcyon.com>
but would rather just have
  To: dagon@halcyon.com

The only way I can think to accomplish this is to leave Fullname blank
in your addressbook.  Pine doesn't allow this when adding an address,
but you can edit it to be blank.  Even then, it still uses angle
brackets around the address, but if you go up to the address and then
immediately down again they go away.

Do you have some weird mail transport that doesn't handle the standard
name <address> or do you just not like it?

Two, at least.  I'm running one of them on a vax/vms cluster:
a free port of 3.91 by Yehavi Bourvine at HUJI.

Subject: Invalid mail folder
Message-Id: <D6HAJ2.HC7@cuug.ab.ca>

Hi,

I have Pine 3.89 running on a SVR4 UNix Box (MIPS). It's been running 
great for a few months now but suddenly on the weekend we've run into a snag.

WHen opening the INBOX I get the error message "[INBOX] is not a folder".

The format has not changed from last week to this week so I don't see 
what has gone wrong.

If I change the date in the very first line of the INBOX to be March  instead
of April -- all of a sudden Pine works again (reads the INBOX).

Another weird thing is that if I send mail to someone, the mail gets 
appended to the first mail message (that has a non-april date). So, I get
1 mail file that contains more than 1 mail message.

ANy thoughts?
(I am a little worried as this is occuring suprisingly close to April Fool's
day).

Thanks,
Marc Kneppers

Terry Gray <mailto:gray@cac.washington.edu> pointed me in the right
direction.  There was a bug in my .pinerc file which was not being handled
by the config screen.  I removed the folders out of the .pinerc by hand.

The subject says it all.  I looked through the code and could not find
references to this.  We have a number of mailing lists which are exploded
into MH folders (one file per message).

I wrote a short script to cat them all together but this is kludgy.

I'm using the mailcap file that came with the pine distribution.  When
trying to view a .BMP as an attachment through xv, I get the following
error:

" [VIEWER Result: hd: Not found] "

Any ideas?  When I save the file to disk and view it through xv, I can see
the image just fine.

Thanks,

Subject: Looking for a SMTP daemon to use with PC PINE
Date: 3 Apr 1995 23:22:05 GMT
Message-Id: <3lpvut$1kb@lucy.infi.net>

I am currently running Windows NT 3.5 on a Pentium 90 machine. This 
machine is connected full time to the internet via a PPP connection. 
PC Pine seems to run just fine on the NT machine, but I have been 
unable to find a working SMTP daemon which will handle the job of 
"sniffing" out the incoming mail and converting it to a format that
Pine likes. I have found a SMTP Daemon and confirmed that all of the 
routing is being preformed correctly. This Deamon simply stores the 
incoming message "lock, stock and barrel" in a text file. I need to
find one that will use all of structures (files, formats, etc) which 
Pine expects. I have been "flailing" with this problem for several 
weeks and would greatly appreciate any help in solving it. I really
like the Pine system and would like to continue to use it on my PC.

I would like to know is it the MUA (Pine) or sendmail that creates the 
message-id. I am getting (xxxxx@host) rather than (xxxxx@host.domain)
and want to track how to solve this problem.

I get different results if my /etc/hosts has

   host IP       host   host.domain
   
and 
 
   host IP	host.domain host


the former gives a Message-ID  <xxxxx@host>
the latter gives a Message-ID  <xxxx@host.domain>


Thanx

I use pine through a provider on Unix, and have this problem: When I am 
drafting a message and am prompted for the recipient's address, I strike 
^T to retrive that address from my addressbook, and the retrived address 
must be edited to remove the preceeding user name and surrounding '<' and 
'>' signs. My addressbook might be faulty. Can someone here offer me any 
suggestions for correcting this problem as I want the address I retrieve 
from my address book under pine to be only the Internet address?

                Two questions. Is there a way to print parts of the addressbook? I want
to break up a group, limiting one part to catalogers, and putting all the others (with
some additional people) into another. I can print messages by sending them to
my LaMail and printing from there, but I don't know what to do with address lists.
        Also, not completely unrelated: last time I tried to send to two groups, which
overlapped (something I do routinely in poor old CA-email), I got such a hash of
error messages that I had to cancel and start over. I may take the trouble to
devise disjoint groups in this instance, but I sure hope I don't have to all the time.

PS: I had to forward this to my pine account from LaMail, which failed 
(via NR/2) to post it. I've tried (obviously not correctly) to correct 
the formatting ...

Whenever I attempt to send attachments greater than 32k they fail.  No 
error message is returned.  

My configuration is PC's running PC-PINE to an IMAP server on an Ultrix 
machine.  The Ultrix machine has no problem sending large files so the 
error appears to be between the PC and IMAP.

How can I turn on debug to diagnosis the problem?
Has anyone else seen this problem?

(Sorry if this has been asked a million times before ... I couldn't
find the answer in the FAQ.)

Is there a way to get Pine to display long lines wrapped over several
lines the way Emacs can?

In Gnu Emacs, for instance, the variable truncate-lines set to t
causes the display algorithm to truncate long lines the way pine/pico
does.  Setting it to nil causes the display algorithm to wrap long
lines.  This has nothing to do with the actual contents of the buffer
(e.g., I think I understand about the -w flag, but it's not the answer
here.)

The reason we'd like this is that we're trying to use pine or pico as
a code editor in a MOO client.  Lines that extend off of the screen
make reading the code difficult, and automatically inserting CR's when
the user types close to the edge of the screen is not very convenient
either.

Any help with pine/pico or pointers to similar editors with this
flexibility in their display algorithms would be greatly appreciated.
 Thank you,

I'm not sure how everyone else's systems are configured, but on our
VAXcluster, you need to do some quoting to set forwarding correctly.  For
example, the command I would use to forward my mail to my lenin account is:

	set forward "in%""tom@lenin.cc.rochester.edu"""

This is under VMS 5.5 running PMDF with the free version of Pine.  (The PMDF
version is not installed on my system.)  Your mileage may vary.

We have installed w32sOLE (for ncsa's mosaic), now pine is twitchy.

On gateway 2000, it will either lock up the whole system or get you back 
to a dos prompt.  On every other civilized computer, we get the following 
error:

[CLOSED] IMAP connection broken <server response>

ANYBODY ELSE EVER SEE THIS?  MORE IMPORTANTLY, HAS ANYBODY ELSE COME UP 
WITH A FIX?

I have an address group set up which includes about 140 names. When i

then it is followed by the message I sent. I have included myself in this 
distribution list, and I always get my message FROM me. Does anyone know 
if there is a problem here? Are some people NOT getting my messages? 
Assistance would be appreciated.

   It may be that the dates shown are the dates of composition, not 
arrival. News can easily get out of order that way, since the messages 
travel through many different routes, some batched, like uucp.

  Is it possible that your system manglers were playing with versions for 
some reason? Or do you have the binary in your home directory? That's 
exactly the sort of behavior that would ensue if they put an old version 
back in for a minute to see if it also had a newly discovered 
bug/feature/interaction with sendmail.

There is no mail filtering built into Pine, but it happily handles the
results of other mail filter programs.

A popular one is "procmail", which can be obtained (according to its
documentation) at:  ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de as
pub/packages/procmail/procmail.tar.gz

I've been using it quite happily for a few months now.  When it "broke"
for a few days (actually, our user disk filled, so all it could do was
stuff all incoming mail into my mail mail file) I realized just how
quickly I'd come to depend on it!

I am running also Pine under Linux and have exactly the same problem.  "Pine 
Technical Notes" in chapter "Spell Checker" on page 45 says that "Pine also 
respect the environment variable SPELL.  If it set, Pine will use that as a 
spelling checker".  I have tried to set an environment variable in my 
.bashrc file but it did not work.  Perhaps I did not set it right. Please 
let me know if you solved this problem.

Since the first time I posted it switch back to version 3.89, but now it

Is there any way that Pine can be configured to send
out vacation messages in response to incoming mail
when you are away?

You should use procmail. It does a very nice job.

Can someone explain how to setup printing from a Solaris 2.3 environment

Not so far as I know, but there is a Unix command "vacation" which does.  
It will forward messages and send back a canned reply; consult your local 
manpages for implementation.

        We do that here. Once you're signed onto the machine, simply type pine, and
hit enter. Presto, you're in.

The situation is a little unfortunate here.  Although the date in the
From_ line is indeed supposed to be a fixed-format ctime() string,
almost all mail agents -- including SunOS /usr/ucb/mail, elm, and MH's
inc program -- will accept slight variations, and will tolerate the
missing leading blank in a single-digit day-of-month field.  Thus, if a
slightly 'nonstandard' local mail delivery program is operating, pine
may end up being the only user agent on the system that cannot parse
the mailbox.

So, it now becomes a matter of debate as to which was really broken:
pine or the delivery agent.  From a strict interpretation of de facto
standards, it was the delivery agent that was broken.  But this may not
be a good argument to use when talking to the person who asks, "how come
everything else works but pine doesn't?"

Mailstrom is a good Pine-like IMAP mail client for the Mac.  Its display
is quite a bit like Pine's (I suspect C-Client code is in use..) and it
supports opening multiple mail folders as well as searching & marking
messages based on text in the messages.  It's available on
ftp://lindy.stanford.edu/pub/treister/mailstrom/

I have posted this question before, and no one answered.  I dunno if that's just
a stupid question, or there is no product.

What I am looking for is this:
	- A E-Mail reader that has the ability to log onto our school's POP server, and
retreive my mail.

You see, I usually use Eudura for Macintosh over PPP to get my mail.  But, when
I'm in the labs, it's a pain in the butt to get my mail (I have to D/L Eudura,
configure it...etc...)

In any case, if there is such a program available available for UNIX, could
someone please E-Mail with the name?

Thanks alot.

Hi,

Can someone help me a problem I have sending mail to an MCI address via
PINE? 

The address is:

@gatekeeper.mcimail.com:sn=name%g=first%o=cs_first_boston%dda
=id=csfbg+pnameb%csfbg@mcimail.com
(one line)

If I type the address in the appropriate field PINE interprets each "@"
as a seperate address:

To: Name <@mcimail.com, @CSFBG, @OU1=IS, @O=CS_First_Boston,
     @G=firstname:S=Name@S=Name>

What can I do to correct this?

Thanks.

Jeff

Date: 04 Apr 95 09:56:20 BST
Message-Id: <955604095620@ibm3090.bham.ac.uk>

==============================================================================
I want to change my return e-mail address in the "From:" line that
is placed in outgoing messages by Pine 3.89 on a unix machine.

The problem is that I want to use my "standard" address known to
my university's central mail server (as it appears in the header of
this post), and not my address on that particular computer.  When
people reply to this "standard" address, which is expected to remain
unchanged, I can have the mail forwarded to any computer(s) of my
choice, depending on circumstances.

Pine automatically inserts its own domain name and my user-id on
that computer into my e-mail address.  I can successfully change the
domain of the address by setting the variable "user-domain" in my
personal configuration file.  However, it appears to be impossible
to change the variable "user-id".  According to the Pine Technical
Notes (version 3.91), this can only be done in PC-Pine.

How can I replace my default e-mail address in the "From:" line to
my preferred address?  Any help will be greatly appreciated.

Hi.  I have a question.  In pine version 3.91, when in the
addressbook, there is a function called edit.  If you invoke this
function, one of the fields displayed for editing is the comment field
or 'c'.  When I put in a comment, it is never displayed, and if I go
back and look, it isn't in the comment field either.  Is this a bug,
have I got something set wrong in the configuration, or what?  Can
someone explain this?
Thanks in advance.

I want to call Pine from a script.  Pine will call another script as an 
alternate editor.

Can I pass the value of a variable from the first script to the alternate 
editor without using an environment variable?  An environment variable is 
out of the question.  :)

After some experimentation I found that although pine will use any
specified 'user-domain' when forming the reply address, it will still
use the local host name for the message-id, and apparently does not 
check to make sure that the part after the '@' is a fully-qualified
domain name.  It *could* append the 'user-domain' after the host name
if the host name does not contain a dot, but does not do so.  The basic
problem is that the MTA is not being given an opportunity to do the
things it knows most about, such as setting the correct reply address
and message-id.  The MUA is trying to do the MTA's job.

A similar design flaw exists in the MH mail system, though it's not as
acute, becaue MH tries to form the reply address but not the
message-id.

What saves the user is that in almost all cases, syntactically-invalid
message-ids will be accepted by receiving software.  I don't believe I
have ever observed email to be bounced or dropped because of an invalid
message-id.  The only likely exception is that if a mail-to-News
gateway preserves the message-id, the gatewayed posting will likely be
dropped by inn sites, unless the gateway takes steps to correct the
syntax in the message-id or generate a new one.  Fortunately most such
gateways just replace the old message-id with a new valid one.

This issue is something to think about, but not worth losing sleep
over.

I have a similar problem under OS/2.  My take is that the OS/2 telnet 
program is sending the "print to attached ansi" stuff to the print queue 
without any consideration of formatting for postscript, and the print 
manager isn't smart enough (or hasn't been told enough information) to 
know to ask whether the stuff being queued is postscipt.  In other 
situations under OS/2 the print manager is very smart - like when I drag 
an icon to a postscript printer is always asks (and does so for other 
printers as well).  I was thinking this was an OS/2 to pine interaction 
problem, but if you are not using OS/2 then other systemns have the same 
kind of problem.

Hello Pine Info --

Is there a way to disable the KBLock (Keyboard Lock) feature of Pine?  

Also, I'm trying to print to my local printer; I've discovered that 
MacKermit and MicroPhone for Mac support it. I haven't been able to get 
Claris Works for Mac or Microsoft Works for Mac to work properly.  Does 
anyone know of any other packages that support local printing?

Thanks,

Mary Aplin

    I'm on a Mac with NCSA telnet right now, with two simultaneous sessions.
With this telnet session I have no problem with the Emacs ^X^C.  (SunOS)
    With the other session, I can't use ^C without a program aborting, and
the RETURN in Pine or Emacs acts as a ^J linefeed, and when I resume a ^Z
suspended session, the terminal is in a very weird mode.  (BSD386)

    I've learned to use the ESC ESC x sequence in place of the ^x character,
so when I forget and hit RETURN in the header, I try to remember to use
ESC ESC C to cancel the request for an attachment.  It's ugly, but it
works, and for it I am grateful, since I've had to use it more often than
I care to think.  I suspect there's some interaction between the NCSA telnet
client and the telnetd on the host, and I know I've seen the solution here
before, so I suspect it will be reposted...

    I've experienced something similar during the time when the IMAP
timeout should not occur.  I'm not sure how I can definitively repeat
the dead stream condition, and perhaps my setup is a bt unusual.

    I've hacked Pine to recognize the {imap.host/user=name} specification
for pre-authenticated login, and to verify that would co-exist with the
normal IMAP opening, I set both my local INBOX and a remote folder six
timezones away to be accessed with IMAP.

    What appears to happen is that when I am in the remote folder, doing
something like answering mail with an alternate editor or something, when
I return to the local INBOX or leave the alternate editor, that local INBOX
has become closed.  I'm pretty sure I haven't left Pine suspended for the
30 minute IMAP inactivity timeout, but it doesn't always close when I think
it might, and it's the *local* folder that's being closed with frequency.

    I'll have to do more checking to see how I can get this to happen with
certainty, for I'm pretty sure the inactivity timer from a suspended Pine
should *not* occur, but I'll have to check, and verify the hacks I've made
do not interfere with Pine's normal operation.

In Mac NCSA telnet, pull down Session, Setup Keys, and blank out the
three boxes, especially the one that makes ^C be Interrupt Process
(referring to the Mac!).  Save the settings.  I can't figure out why
anyone would want the defaults; ^C is essential to unix systems.

The ^J problem is tough.  The return key and even literally control-M
end up sending a ^J to the unix host.  I've been told in some cases
it's an old version of telnetd on the host.  We gave up here and
hacked pine so ^J is treated like RETURN (^M), and reassigned the
functions of ^J to other control keys.  Not too awful, although
it's little changes all over the place.  3.91 was easier than 3.05.

It would be a nice compile option to get the "No-control-j" version.
Actually, I can only blame myself for not packaging the changes as
patches yet.

For Linux i had to change the entry in /etc/HOSTNAME to the FQDN to get
it work. But it still adds my hostnames to the message ID that isn't known
to the net. (I'm just a UUCP Site)

I don't understand that. Why is it dropped ?
Btw inn generates also wrong message-ID's for me. It also adds the Hostname
to my domain. So perhaps my messages will be dropped also ?

Subject: Possible addressbook bug, and some other Qs
Date: 3 Apr 95 21:45:58 GMT
Message-Id: <epstein.796945558@napcc-hp>

I sent this report to the pine-bugs address, but got back a response
that (among other things) suggested I try the pine newsgroup for a
faster response, so I am posting it here.

I had a problem with an entry in the global address book.  I'm not
sure it's a bug, but I couldn't find any specific problems.

What happened is that I had an entry that had some number of levels of
nested aliases/nicknames (i.e. other address book entries).
Specifically, there was one entry that had six levels, including the
very top and bottom levels, although I'm not sure that's significant.

When I composed a message and gave the top level nickname as the To:,
it was read in OK, but there was a problem with the format.  When I
moved down to the next header line, it indicated a problem with the
contents of the To: line; the message was something like: "Junk at end
of To: line: '> .......'".  Looking back at the To: line, it looked
like an address had been wrapped/split at an inappropriate place (in
the middle of the domain name) and an end-of-line comma inserted there
a bit before the address it seemed to be complaining about.

The same problem occurred when I tried the next highest level
nickname, but things were fine when I moved down another level.  The
problem also disappeared when I changed the order of the
nicknames/names in the second highest level nickname -- the problem
occurred when I had the nickname that continued the long chain listed
first, but things were OK when I moved a regular name (i.e. a regular
username, not a nickname) to the front of the list.

Does this make sense?  Sorry I had to describe it instead of sending
the actual entries, but I'd rather not send those unless absolutely
necessary.

Besides this problem, I had a few other questions related to
addressbook nicknames and how they appear in the To: line.

1. They appear including the "fullname" description of the nickname
(the second field of the addressbook entry).  Is there a way to set it
up so that this does not appear?  For such deeply nested nicknames,
often the "fullname" isn't really meaningful (it's likely just some
arbitrarily chosen grouping name).

2. Sometimes the number of actual addresses in a nickname can be
fairly high, and you end up with a very long To: line.  Is there a way
to set it up so that the addresses are not shown (sort of like a Bcc:,
or "address list suppressed" type of thing), or that only the nickname
(or its corresponding fullname) is shown?

Thanks for your help.

We are looking for a way to start pine with a newsgroup loaded similar to 
starting it with a folder opened using the -f option.

We would like to start pine from a menu option  (ie pine comp.mail.pine)
and have the newsgroup loaded and the index screen displayed.  Anyone 
have any ideas?

We are trying to set up Pine for some external users, and would like to 
do the following:

1) Use separate pine.conf and pine.conf.fixed files for the external 
users and internal users.

2) Direct Pine to create and use the .pinerc in the user's mail 
directory, as opposed to their home directory, due to a shared home 
directory.

3) Name the mail directory Mail.${LOGNAME} to differentiate between each 
users' mail directories.

I have managed to get 2 & 3 to work for internal user with command line 
options, but getting 1 to work properly (the pine.conf.fixed is a must, 
don't want them changing certain values) is a bugger.

Any help would be appreciated. Please direct answers to my email address, 
not just the list as I am no longer on the list. TIA

    This is a bug in BSD Sendmail v8.6.10.  You should upgrade to sendmail
8.6.12, which no longer has this problem.  Pine is not submitting the
messages incorrectly.

As the subject says, I have a few questions about configuring pine.

1. I noticed a behavior where when I replied to a message where I was
among the original recipients, I am removed from the resulting
recipients list (all on the To: line).  Is there any way to set this
up so I am not removed?  (Mailers based on Berkeley mail have the
"metoo" variable that controls this.)

2. Is there any way to get pine to show the line count of a message
instead of the byte count in the index?

3. Is there any way to globally disable using pine for news?  I tried
setting nntp-server to "" in the fixed global config file.  This seems
to work, as no newsgroups as shown in the folder list.  But when you
enter the folder list and when you move down to the newsgroup listing,
it beeps and displays the message "No such host as".  This doesn't
really cause any problems, but I was wondering whether there was a
more definitive way to do it.

4. There were some things about the feature-list that I couldn't
understand.  First, a number of features were listed without their
having been specified in the global or my personal config file (these
are: enable-aggregate-command-set, enable-bounce-cmd, enable-flag-cmd,
enable-jump-shortcut, and enable-suspend).  In addition, I noticed the
feature old-growth in my .pinerc (originally created automatically by
pine), yet I couldn't find it mentioned in any of the documentation.
I think these two may be related, since when I deleted old-growth from
my .pinerc, those features were no longer set.  However, upon
subsequently exiting pine, old-growth magically reappeared, and the
next time I ran pine those features were back again.

Perhaps also related, I deleted signature-at-bottom from my .pinerc
(since it is in our global config file), but it also magically
reappeared after running pine.

5. Any reason why the standard-printer is shown as lpr even though
it's set to lp in both the fixed and regular global config files?

Thanks for any help/comments.

You may want mpack and munpack.

                unix1.andrew.cmu.edu:/pub/mpack/README.ftp

Mpack and munpack are utilities for encoding and decoding
(respectively) binary files in MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extensions) format mail messages.  For compabibility with older forms
of transferring binary files, the munpack program can also decode
messages in split-uuencoded format.  The mac port can also decode
messages in split-binhex format.

In short, mpack is the MIME equivalent of uudecode/binhex.

Versions are included for unix, pc, os2, mac, amiga, and archimedes
systems.

This MIME implementation is intended to be as simple and portable as
possible.  For a slightly more sophisticated MIME implementation, see
the program MetaMail, available via anonymous FTP to
thumper.bellcore.com, in directory pub/nsb

The free version of Pine/VMS will also work acceptably with no tcp/ip
support at all.  I'm running v3.89, and it's perfectly happy to use VMS mail
to handle mail transport with only a couple of mchanges to the configuration
files.  It even automatically turns user@host.domain into
in%"user@host.domain".  Some of the other features available in the PMDF
version (like PMDF alias/list management) aren't available in the free
version, but as nobody else on the entire cluster (1000+ accounts?) has
asked for Pine, I can't see any reason to ask the systems group to install
it.  I'm happy with v3.89, I don't use IMAP, and I can use my PMDF lists &
aliases by just using user+alias@host.domain addressing.  Works for me.  :)

You definitely want the latter case in /etc/hosts.  I had the same 
problem until I read the PINE technical docs!  always have the 
fully-qualified domain name first and then any aliases for the /etc/hosts 
entry.

Just curious if anyone is working on/finished an NT port of Pine.  Not 
necessarily looking for a GUI version console would be fine so long as 
don't need to keep the 16bit subsystem running....

There was a long discussion a few months ago about return receipts.  Pine 
does not provide return receipts.

WordPerfect Office Main and cc:Mail will send receipts when a message is 
opened for reading. (That doesn't ensure that the recipient read it <g>.)

Nothing is more effective that asking the recipient at the end of the 
message to send a message of reply.  That usually means he actually read \
it.

Be advised that many people do not like the automatic receipt feature.  
They can clog up mailboxes and are especially annoying on lists.

Hope this helps.

Subject: No-op dead stream when using alternate editor
Date: 4 Apr 1995 20:58:21 GMT
Message-Id: <3lsbtd$ldf@bigblue.oit.unc.edu>

If you spawn an alternate editor (vi, emacs, ispell, whatever) by ^_ in 
the editing window and you obtain INBOX via IMAP, you can only keep your 
alternate editor open for as long as timeout takes on the IMAP server, 
because apparently Pine simply suspends and waits for the alternate 
editor to exit, and it isn't sending NOOP instructions down the line to 
keep the IMAP connection active.

Any chance the code can be modified so that, when an alternate editor is 
spawned, the IMAP client will go into the background and continue to 
send NOOPs at the appropriate times?

Since I use Pico for short compositions, but emacs when I need to write 
something long and involved, this gets me every time!

Anyone had any luck getting Windows pc-pine and SLIP working with Trumpet 
winsock?

Pine is finding the host but failing to connect to the IMAP server. It 
continues trying and after the first minute, and each 15 secs further, 
asks if you want to continue trying.

I can telnet to the IMAP host from the winsock machine so it's alive and 
well.

Thanks for any help,

Sounds like it might be a bug, all right.  I'm not able to figure out 
what the problem might be without a specific example to work with.  If 
you'd like to send me the addressbook and tell me which nicknames work 
and which don't, I'd be happy to look at it.  Or, if you can cook up a 
fake addressbook with this problem, then you wouldn't have to send the 
real one.

Not in 3.91.  In 3.92 you will be able to have a blank fullname field for 
any entry and then it will do what you want, I think.

You can use the Bcc line for that.  When you're in the composer, type ^R 
while your cursor is in the headers and then you will see the Bcc line.

I'm writing some documentation on using pine as a newsreader & would like 
some help. For the new user (on my system at least) a .newsrc file is not 
automatically created. If a user goes into pine for the first time and 
wants to read the news he/she cannot until the .newsrc file has been 
created in their UNIX directory. I've gotten around this in classes I've 
taught by having them start up nn first. nn creates the .newsrc, then I 
have them quit nn and start up pine to read the news.

My question-Is there any way to create a .newsrc in a user's directory
solely from the pine interface?

Thanks in advance

We have a user who has reported (and I have verified it) that several 
messages are getting concatinated together when she view her INBOX.  I've 
looked at the file and it looks OK and both from and mail see more 
messages than pine does (I've even read it into mail and saved it which 
is our usual fix).  I edited the file and added additional returns before 
the messages in question and it starts Working (I used
".,$s/^From /^V^MFrom /" in vi to edit it).

Has anyone else seen this?

We are running pine 3.91 on AIX 3.2.5.  It has had the problem with the 
originally distrubted binary as well as one we've compiled with -O2.

Hello.  By any chance, is the date that works something like "Mar 31" and 
the date that loses something like "Apr 3" (as opposed to "Apr  3")?  In 
the "From " header line, the date is a fixed format ctime() format 
string, and thus the day field is fixed-width (hence requiring a leading 
space for single-digit days).

This is usually caused by a non-standard mail delivery program at the 
local site, and generally when this gets called to their attention the 
sysadmins at the site fix it pronto.

Subject: Configuring for Mime attachment
Date: 6 Apr 1995 00:05:52 GMT
Message-Id: <3lvb90$70g@data.interserv.net>

How can I configure Pine to view the following attachment.

  Content-Type: application/octet-stream; name="OFFCPLA3.DOC"
  Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
  Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="OFFCPLA3.DOC"

When I try to view it, I get the following message:

  Don't now how to display attachment format Application/OCTET-STREAM

Assuming I can decode the attachment, are there any UNIX tools, possibly
X-based, that will allow me to view the .DOC file, which is a Microsoft
Word document.  Looking for a free option here, something Public Domain.

Along the same lines, are there any UNIX tools which would allow me to view
other DOS or Windows files.  ie. Excel, WordPerfect, etc

Windows pine is already available.  I've been using it for a few months now.

Since you asked, I think it's an awful idea....whenever I'm testing out a 
new newsreader hack, it hangs up on "subscribe newsgroup alt.fan.foo" or 
some such (for we all know what a pain it is to run an ls -lt against 
the index of newsgroup files) until I go in and answer no to the 
question with my old newsreader (tin).

While the spell checker for pine is useful in that it tells you that 
the word is misspelled, I need it to correct my poor spelling too. Is 
there any good spell checkers out there that will work with pine that will
do this? Thanks for any and all help!

We have several MACs attached to our local campus network and many people 
have complained that Ctrl C doesn't work.  Thus, they can't cancel 
messages, etc.

I was told that changing the .profile file would correct the problem.  I 
substituted ^? for ^H.   It didn't work.

We are running Pine on an HP9000, unix platform.

Help!

I recently bought a laser printer, but I can no longer print out my email

I have been using the terminal program in Windows to dial into my 
account.  I've talked with others on my campus who also have trouble 
printing with laser printers.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Use either the enable-alternate-editor-implicitly or
enable-alternate-editor-cmd commands.  For more info see the help
screens, which are accessed with `?', in the configuration setup

Howdy, I am using Pine 3.89 on my access provider.  The provider is

Qmodem 4.5.  I am wondering if there is a way to configure Pine to print 
my messages on my printer.  I have tried all the term emulations that are 
available to me with no luck. 
Thanks

Here we have a global address book in /usr/local/lib we call it 
TECH_AMA_ADDRESSES (you can call it anything you like)

Also in /usr/local/lib our pine.conf (so everybody see's the same address 
book) has an entry like:

# List of file or path names for global/shared addressbook(s).
# Default: none
# Syntax: optnl-label path-name
global-address-book=/usr/local/lib/TECH_AMA_ADDRESSES

# List of file or path names for personal addressbook(s).
# Default: ~/.addressbook (Unix) or \PINE\ADDRBOOK (PC)
# Syntax: optnl-label path-name
address-book=

(you .pinerc file will look the same, but I recomend that you use the 
pine.conf so that you do not have to edit everybodies .pinerc file)

AS FAR AS THE PC VERSION -- I thought I had that working once, but my 
machine is the one that is experimented on with new software and now it 
doesn't.  As soon as I get my pc back up though, I'll try to drop you a line.

Also I have a long (11M postscript) document on how to use pine for 
absolute beginners.  If you would like to see the first couple of pages 
to see if it is something you could use let me know.

good luck

Howdy, my access provider is using pine 3.89 and running Linux 1.1.59 
(POSIX).  I am wondering if there is an easy way to set up some remote 
folders for another server that I use.  Currently that server is 
forwarding all my mail to this system.  Also can someone let me know 
where I can find some filter programs that will let me sort incoming mail 
into seperate folders?

And finally, in all the help screens it says you can do this and that in 
the configuration menu but neither of the access providers version of 
Pine has a configuration menu.  Is this something that is available in a 
newer version?
Thanks for the help

Someone helped me when I had this problem, so I'll try to help you.  
Hopefully one of these two suggestions will work.

Make sure that the files with these names actually have been deleted from 
your folder directory.  Then edit your .pinerc file and delete the folder 
names from your incoming folder statement.  You can't do this from the 
config menu.  You haved to edit the .pinerc file.  Good luck.

Hi all,

Sometimes when I'm composing my mail in Pine and I got logged out 
suddenly, Pine resumes my mail when next time I login again.  However, it 
doesn't always do this to protect me.  When and under what circumstances 
will pine do such protection and when not?  Thank you.  (BTW, I'm dialing 
up to a UNIX server via modem.)

Trailing space(s) when mail is transmitted in qp mode.  But if the
recipient is using a MIME-compatible reader they will not see these.
qp encoding is only seen by s/one viewing the raw MIME.

Trailing space(s) alone would not cause PINE to use QP encoding,
I think.  But if it uses qp encoding for some other reason, it
will encode trailing spaces in this way.

Don't do whatever it is that you are doing to put PINE into qp mode ;-)
Somewhere in that MIME is likely to be some other =xx encoding or
other reason for PINE to have chosen to use qp encoding.
 
>or is it a MIME incompatability at the receiver's site?
 
Sounds as if the receiver does not use a MIME-compatible mail
client.

Please don't say that, it's so irritating!  We all have ideas,

Unfortunately I also saw some mailing lists processors removing the=20

I wasn't clear in my message.  I can attach the binaries and send them to
people.  What I can't figure out is how to tell the recieving mailers what
TYPE of binary is coming.  The mailcap file specifies what viewer to run when
a particular type of binary is viewed.  For example, in the default mailcap
file, all binaries designated IMAGE should be displayed using the xv viewer.
What happens when I mail the file to myself and other pine users, is that
pine doesn't know what the binary type is and simply brings up a hex viewer
on the file.  What I want is to understand how to tell pine to designate the
binary as an image file so that that other MIME compatible readers can
behave intelligently.

it, and then I had to search the pine-info archive, where a couple other 
of your posts appeared that had never made it to news.  I haven't looked 
thoroughly to see if there are other posts mailed to pine-info that never 
made it through the gateway.
    Also, said news to mail and back gateway fails to pass the Reply-To: 
header from one to the other, which could be a problem for those whose 
From: fields are not the ones at which mail is desired...

    But then, this is not too much different from how the mail would appear
were it to be sent by Unix mail, such as...
% uuencode core My_last_Unix_act.jpg | mail -s "Oh yeah?  Up yours" root
...since most rewriting rules do not add hostname for local delivery.

As a result, I've added comp.mail.headers (and dropped the zmailer group)
to debate the merits of headers with only the login for the address.
I was discussing how I attempted to reply to a message received on a remote
machine, but delivered locally on that machine, retrieved via IMAP.  My
reply wound up with the *local* hostname appended to the login, which was
not a valid recipient...

    I've done more tests, having read through the IMAP4 RFC in a state of
exhaustion to the point of hallucination, since it seemed that page 48 gave
the indication that an IMAP client should be able to reconstruct the address
as the IMAP server provides the hostname in its replies.
    Attempting to reply to a number of messages with no hostname in the
address, whether stripped to <login> form by zmailer, or simply never given
the hostname by the sendmail rules for local delivery; in all cases, I
wound up with a reply to the correct address, hostname and all.

    Then I got to thinking.  The mailbox from which I read the mail is a bit
distant, so I am in the habit of saving my mail to which I wish to reply to
a local mailbox, so that the connection to the IMAP server does not hinder
my composing a response.

    When I saved messages from a couple different IMAP servers, with the
address as either login (from Unix mail on local machine) or <login> (from
Pine stripped by zmailer), and attempted to reply to those, I could not get
the correct address.  The information provided by the IMAP server about the
hostname is lost when the message is saved to the local folder.

    My question now is:  should the IMAP client be saving the message with
the qualified address, so that information does not get lost?  And would
it be a good idea for the various sendmail rewriting rules to provide the
full address as a default, even for messages delivered locally, in case
those messages are accessed remotely and transferred to another machine?

    While the simplicity of a simple login for an address may have had its
merits in years past, I feel that the time may have come to recognize that
mail delivered locally doesn't always stay that way, and in my opinion, it
would be preferable for the default sendmail rules to provide a complete
e-mail address for delivery, even locally, regardless of the source of the
mail (Pine, Unix mail, or whatever).

    Of course, there will always be mail with only the login for an address,
so perhaps the IMAP client should do something with these when placing them
anywhere other than where the message was received...

I found a simple filter written in C, called "encdec".  I think I
used archie (or possibly Lycos search) to find it.  It doesn't need
any other binaries or scripts.
 
If you don't manage to find it, email me and I'll look for you.

Mime-Version: 1.0

I've had difficulty sending bcc messages to members of a relatively large 
distribution list (now 60 -- I was originally trying 240, but broke the 
list into 4):  I'm trying to send a message to all these folks without 
sending them long headers they'll have to scroll through.  

Everything works fine until the point I send, when I get a short note on the 
screen saying either "Memory #" or "Bus #".  But the debug transcripts 
indicate the sends are successful.  Nevertheless, I only get the message in my 
Fcc file (though I am the primary addressee) and none of the members of the 
distribution list report ever getting the message at all.  Is this a pine 
problem?  A system problem?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Tim

I am running SunOS 4.1.3 on a Sparc 10 with sendmail 8.6.10.  When pine 
replies to all recipients (and this list of recipients is rather long),
I get the following message on my console:

kanga sendmail[1635]: POSSIBLE ATTACK from username@localhost: newline in string
"user1@host1.edu, user2@host2.edu, user3@host3.edu, user4@host4.edu, 
user5@host5.edu,      user6@host6.edu, ....... " etc.

I realize that newlines in strings were security problems before sendmail
8.6.10 but has now been apparently fixed, and this is why sendmail
is giving me this message, but why does the latest version of pine still
submit messages incorrectly this way?  Is there a patch?

Ron,
Unfortunately you can't control the MIME type in current version,
but you will be able to in the next one via a "mimetypes" file.

Seems to work okay for me.  Make sure that you have an entry for
IMAP2 in the Winsock "services" files.  I seem to recall adding a
line like:

imap2		143/tcp		#Internet Mail Access Protocol v2

to my services file quite some time back.

Hello

How can Pine work with remote MH-Folders via IMAP in the same
way as with MH?

As MH saves messages as seperate files in folder directories
Pine seems to be unable to deal with this structure because Pine
expects folder files.

I'm afraid thinking in the wrong direction!
But, thanks for any hints.

Hi.  Has anyone experienced a problem like this and solved it:

To begin with, most of the users in my department use elm (actually two 
different versions! 70.85 and 2.4.PL21), and elm (at least the old 
version) likes to add some keywords about MIME, even though MIME-support 
is disabled.

What happens is that I often get messages which appear to have 
attachments, but don't.  In other words, the message looks like your 
average message, but PINE gets fooled into thinking that the message is 
in MIME format.  Commonly all I see is the sender's .signature.  Now, I 
have sent myself mail with elm 2.4.PL21 with no problems, both fresh 
messages and replies.  Recently, a friend sent a message, of which I 
could read his text, but not any of the lines of an included message 
starting with the usual ">"'s.  I didn't realize that I hadn't read all 
of the message until I went to reply, and there was the first part I had 
never seen.  However, I can always read these messages in elm, emacs 
rmail, and the crappy old UNIX mail.  Arghh.

Any advice.  Sorry if my message was a little confusing.  Thanks.

Thanks Ashok, that's got it. Although I'm adding 

  imapd		143/tcp

rather than imap2.

How do I speicify the MIME type when attaching a binary?  As a test, I sent
an image to myself and all pine could do was run od against it.  I have my
.mailcap set up and it is supposed to run xv for images.  Obviously, I'm
encoding the fact that the .bmp file is an image.  Any ideas?

Thanks,

Subject: Pine keeps replacing tabs with =09- Help!
Date: 7 Apr 1995 02:13:41 GMT
Message-Id: <3m274l$h1@dartvax.dartmouth.edu>

Hi,
	I've recently installed pine (v3.90) on our SGI IndigoII.  It
seems to work ok, except whenever I "Read in" a file (with the ^R
command), pine replaces any tabs with "=09" and LFs (I think) with =20.

	If the recipient uses pine to read the message, it's not a 
problem.  But if you use "mail" to read the message, it has all the tabs,
etc. replaced.  The read-in file is fine, since it gets sent just fine
if I use "mail" to send the file.

	Any hints would be *greatly* appreciated!  I often read-in
files in messages I send; I need them to be sent without modification.
Note that I get the same problem wither I use vi, emacs, or pico to
create the file that I subsequently read-in.

	Thanks a bunch,
-John Boswell

Date: 6 Apr 1995 21:51:03 GMT
Message-Id: <3m1no7$1fn@bcrkh13.bnr.ca>

Is there a known problem with sizing of windows on HPUX for Pine 3.91?

I'm not sure if it's my imagination or not but I could swear that I
can resize the window once and Pine realizes it but when I do
it again it does not pick it up.

Say I'm not losing my mind... please!


Also, while I have your attention, is there any way I can get pine
to be more in tune with hpterm? It seems to have has a very 
poor rapport with it in terms of arrow keys and highlighting.


Thank you,

In case no one has responded by now, I find that using a 
header "Return-Receipt-To:" with my e-mail addresss does
the trick.

Be aware that you get a receipt when the mailer processes 
the mail and not when the mail is read.

If you are talking about sharing an addressbook between a Unix system and 
a PC (using some remote filesystem) this won't work with Pine3.91 (due to 
a bug), but it will be fixed for 3.92.

It came time for student government elections here this year, and one of 
the candidates got it into his head what a wonderful idea it would be to 
mail everyone with his campaign manifesto.  Unfortunately all he did was 
put all the user names on the to line, so the first person who responded 
to it also chose to respond to all recipients which put that long list of 
names (over 200) on the CC line.  Now any time someone who has that 
message in his inbox goes into Pine, pine will immediately abort and core 
dump.  We're running 3.91a on AIX 3.2 RS6k if that helps.  

Obviously pine can't be expected to handle messages with unlimited 
lengths of Header fields, but it shouldn't core dump just by running 
pine.  As it stands we had to go into each user's mail box using mailx 
and delete it in there which most users don't know how to do.
I can send a sample of the message if it helps.

Having made a post after 30+ hours of wakefulness about this thread, I
feel obligated to chip in another 2c...

In a previous article, brennan@watsun.cc.columbia.edu (Joe Brennan) says:

>In Mac NCSA telnet, pull down Session, Setup Keys, and blank out the
>three boxes, especially the one that makes ^C be Interrupt Process
>(referring to the Mac!).  Save the settings.  I can't figure out why
>anyone would want the defaults; ^C is essential to unix systems.

    In the setup I was using, these keys were blank.  That's what disturbed
me, along with the fact that of the two sessions I had with identical
settings, one worked well (the SunOS), while the other, um, did not.

    On a different Mac, running the same NCSA telnet, the host which did
not work well before, seemed to be working, until I remembered I had opened
an rlogin to the troublesome host.  My actual telnet session was to a Dec
Ultrix machine, which seemed to cooperate reasonably well with the Mac.

    However, a direct telnet to the BSD/386 machine is a disaster.  I cannot
use many of the control keys.  I can't suspend and continue.  I have to use
ESC ESC ^ to mark text.  (And I thought the Dec with no ESC key was a bit
inconvenient for an Emacs junkie.)  And I think that the ^O was lost -- I use
Emacs too, and I was unable to open a new line.  Right now I can't open a new
line in Emacs, although I think I was able to do so with a direct telnet to
this host (SunOS), which I am now reaching via telnet from the BSD/386 machine
accessed via rlogin from Ultrix to which I have Mac NCSA telnetted.
    I need more OSes I can loop through to reach my destination...

    Obviously, Mac NCSA telnet works with some telnetd programs, and not well
at all with others, and BSD/386 offered by my ISP is not one of them.  (Maybe
there's a replacement for that telnetd...)

Subject: Pine 3.91 slow on opening INBOX ?
Date: 8 Apr 1995 23:31:13 GMT
Message-Id: <3m76c1$opv@usenet.ucs.indiana.edu>

Hi--

I recall seeing sporadic threads about this problem a few months ago,
but unfortunately I didn't save any of the posts. We've recently
upgraded to pine 3.91 (HPUX 10, Ultrix 4.4, OSF/1 2.1) and on all
platforms it appears that the new version requires much more time to
open a user's INBOX than did 3.89. Since this problem is occurring
uniformly on all platforms, it seems safe to assume that the cause lies
in pine and not in an underlying IO problem. I'm collecting profiling
information from 3.91, but in the meantime was this ever resolved? That
is, was it ever pinned down as a pine problem? Any info would be
appreciated. 

thanks

    Failing this, a simple "Re-Open Mailbox" (control-R) command would
do in a pinch.  Right now I have to close the current one, open
another one (assuming I have another mailbox to open), then re-open
the first one.

Why not?  One is readily available.

Mpack and munpack are utilities for encoding and decoding
(respectively) binary files in MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extensions) format mail messages.  For compatibility with older forms
of transferring binary files, the munpack program can also decode
messages in split-uuencoded format.  The Macintosh version can also
decode messages in split-BinHex format.

In short, munpack is the MIME equivalent of uudecode/binhex.

Versions are included for unix, pc, os2, mac, amiga and archimedes
systems.  The canonical FTP site for this software is
ftp.andrew.cmu.edu:pub/mpack/

All official distributions of mpack 1.5 are PGP signed by
John Gardiner Myers <jgm+@cmu.edu>

Procmail works fine with Solaris 2.3 and GCC. Did you follow all the
compilation and installation instructions?

David,
Pine should create a .newsrc automatically when you first subscribe to a 
newsgroup.

Subject: 0.0 About this Article

Q: How can I have my incoming mail messages automatically put into an 
   appropriate folder?

This is one of the most frequently asked questions about email.  This article 
is the first release of an FAQ that addresses this question.  This version 
gives basic instructions for how to set up either procmail or Elm's filter 
to filter incoming mailing list messages.  Future versions of this FAQ will 
include instructions for doing other things like automatically replying to 
certain messages.

If your system has both procmail and filter installed then you should use 
procmail which is *much* more robust and powerful than filter.  This 
recommendation is almost universal; even the Elm and filter developers
recommend procmail over filter.

Subject: ... 0.6 Reading the Plain Text Version of This Article

If you are reading the plain text version (i.e., not the hypertext version) of 
this FAQ it is in RFC1153 digest format which means each subject is formatted 
as a mini mail message with its own Date, From, and Subject (and sometimes 
 Followup-To) headers.  Some newsreaders and mailers make it really easy
to jump to a subject in an article that is in digest format.  Here are 
instruction for some newsreaders:

* NN's default is to split a digest and present each digest item on the 
  menu.  If you have changed the default by putting ``set split off'' in 
  your ~/.nn/init file then you can split an article that is in digest 
  format by typing G% while viewing it.  This will present each digest item 
  on a submenu.  You can then read, followup-to, save, print, etc. individual 
  digest items.

* In trn (and its relatives like rn and strn) you can type ^g (Ctrl key 
  and g key pressed together) to skip to the next line that begins with
  "Subject: "

* In emacs GNUS, C-c C-n will skip to the next digest article (C-C C-p will
  go back to the previous digest article).


If your newsreader or mailer does not have a built-in command that allows
you to easily read a digest you can pipe the article to ``formail -ds''
which will split the article into separate mail messages, and then you can
use your mailer or newsreader (if it can read mail folders) to read the
folder.  For example, here's what you would do in Tin while viewing
the article:

Type...                           In order to...
-------                           --------------
|                                 Pipe
a                                 Specify the article is to be piped
formail -ds >> ~/mail/faq.split   Split the digest into individual
                                  messages and put them in a file named
                                  ~/mail/faq.split.  (Replace ~/mail
                                  with your folder directory.)
pine -if faq.split                Use Pine to read the newly created folder.

For more information see the formail(1) man pages.

Subject: 1.0 Naming Your Incoming Mail Folders

For my incoming mail folders I use names that start with ``IN''.
For example, I put mail sent to the procmail mailing list into a
folder named IN.procmail.  I do this so that when all my folders
are listed alphabetically the incoming folders are together and
near the top.  They are near the top because Unix is case sensitive
and upper case letters come before lower case letters in an ascii
sort.

Of course, you can use any names you like for your mail folders.

Date: 17 Nov 1994 23:02:00 GMT
From: Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: 2.0 Procmail

Procmail is a powerful mail processor that can be used to process your
mail messages either as they arrive or after they are in a mail folder.  
This version of the FAQ describes the basics of setting up procmail to
filter incoming mailing list messages.

To find out how to process existing mail folders see the NOTES section
of the procmail(1) man page.

------------------------------

Date: 17 Nov 1994 23:02:10 GMT
From: Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: ... 2.1 Setting Up Procmail

1] Find out if procmail is on your system and what the full path to it is.  
   If you are using csh type:

     which procmail

   Or if you are using sh or ksh type:

     type procmail

   If neither ``which'' nor ``type'' are on your system try ``whereis'' and
   ``where''.  If your system doesn't have procmail ask your system 
   administrator to install it.  If your sys admin isn't able to do this,
   use a different mail processor like deliver, mailagent, or filter 
   (described in part 2 of this FAQ).


2a] Create ~/.procmailrc.  (Note that throughout this article I use
    pico for editing files.  Replace ``pico'' with your editor.)

     cd
     pico .procmailrc

  
2b] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.procmailrc.
    Note that lines that begin with # are comments and are ignored by
    procmail.

     #Set on when debugging
     VERBOSE=off
 
     #Replace ``mail'' with your mail directory (Pine uses mail, Elm uses Mail)
     MAILDIR=$HOME/mail
     
     #Directory for storing procmail log and rc files
     PMDIR=$HOME/.procmail
     
     LOGFILE=$PMDIR/log
     INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/rc.test
     INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/rc.folders

3] Create the directory where you will store your procmail log and rc files 
   (this is $PMDIR that you set above).

     cd
     mkdir .procmail


4a] Create an rc (run commands) file for testing:

     cd
     cd .procmail
     pico rc.test


4b] Enter the following in ~/.procmail/rc.test:

      :0:
      * ^Subject: .*test
      IN.testing

    Note that the first line contains a zero (0), not the letter "oh".
    For now, don't worry about the meaning of this recipe.  It is
    explained in the subject "Explanation of Test Recipe" below.


5a] Create a ~/.forward file by typing the following. (Pico's -w flag tells 
    pico not to auto wrap lines.)

     cd
     pico -w .forward



5b] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.forward:


     "|IFS=' ' && exec /usr/local/bin/procmail -f- || exit 75 #nancym"


    == IMPORTANT NOTES ==
    * Make sure you include all the quotes, both double (") and single (').
    * The vertical bar (|) is a pipe.
    * Replace /usr/local/bin with the correct path for procmail (see step 1).
    * Replace ``nancym'' with your userid.  You need to put your userid in 
      your .forward so that it will be different than any other .forward file 
      on your system.
   
    * Do NOT use environment variables, like $HOME, in your .forward file.
    * Do NOT expect ~ to mean your home directory in the .forward file: If 
      procmail resides below your home directory write out the *full* path.


5c] Note that on many systems you need to make your .forward world 
    readable and your home directory world searchable in order for the
    mail transport agent to "see" it.  To do this type:
   
      cd
      chmod 644 .forward
      chmod a+x .


6] Send yourself two test messages: one with ``test'' in the subject
   and one without ``test'' in the subject.


7a] Start your mailer (pine, elm, etc.) and check that the messages
    were delivered correctly.  The one with ``test'' in the subject
    should be in the folder $MAILDIR/IN.testing and the one without 
    ``test'' in the subject should be in your inbox.  If these were
    delivered correctly go on to step 8.


7b] TROUBLESHOOTING
    * If the two messages were not delivered correctly look at your
      $LOGFILE (~/.procmail/log) to see if you can determine what
      the problem is.  

    * Check these three files for typos:
        ~/.forward
        ~/.procmailrc
        ~/.procmail/rc.test

    * Check the file and directory permissions of your .forward (set in 
      5c above).

      Type...          In order to...
      -------          --------------
      cd               Go to your home directory.
      
      ls -l .forward   Check the permission: it should say -rw-r--r--
      
      ls -ld .         Check permission of home dir: it should say drwx?-x?-x
                       The ?'s may be r's or hyphens or one of each (i.e.,
                       drwx--x--x, drwxr-xr-x, drwxr-x--x, drwx--xr-x).
      

    * If none of these turn up the problem edit your ~/.procmailrc so
      that it contains:

        VERBOSE=on

      And repeat steps 6 and 7.  If you are still having problems see the 
      subject "Troubleshooting: Alternate .forward Files for Procmail" below.

   
8a] Once you have successfully tested procmail in steps 6 and 7, create 
     rc.folders for filtering incoming messages into mail folders.
  
      cd
      cd .procmail
      pico rc.folders


8b] Enter a modified version of the following in ~/.procmail/rc.folders

     :0:
     * ^TOwww-talk
     IN.www-talk

     :0:
     * ^TOprocmail
     IN.procmail
     
     The first recipe filters the www-talk mailing list and the second recipe
     filters the procmail mailing lists  The meaning of the first recipe is 
     as follows:

     Notation      Meaning
     ========      =======
     :0            Begin a recipe
       :           Use a lock file
     *             Begin a condition 
       ^TO         Match ``To:'' ``Cc:'' or other synonyms for To at the
                   beginning of a line, followed by any or no characters,
                   followed by....
          www-talk  ``www-talk''
     IN.www-talk   If successful match, put in folder $MAILDIR/IN.www-talk

  
     Create a recipe for each of your mailing lists.  Make sure that you
     use ``^TO'' with no space between the caret (^) and the word ``TO'', 
     and that both letters are capitalized -- if you don't it won't work.

     Note that ^TO is not a normal regular expression.  It is a special
     procmail expression that is designed to catch any destination 
     specification.  See the MISCELLANEOUS section of the procmailrc(5)
     man page for details.  For examples, see procmailex(5) man page.
     

9]  Repeat steps 6 and 7 to make sure that things are still working.


10]  Comment out the rc.test line in you .procmailrc file so that it looks 
     like this:
          
       VERBOSE=off
       MAILDIR=$HOME/mail
       PMDIR=$HOME/.procmail
       LOGFILE=$PMDIR/log
       # INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/rc.test
       INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/rc.folders

     Note that it's useful to leave the rc.test line there for future testing.

Subject: ... 2.2 Tracking Your Incoming Mail

There is a useful script, which is part of the procmail package, for 
checking your procmail log file called mailstat.  Check to see if it is 
on your system by typing either ``which mailstat'' or ``type mailstat''.  
If it's on your system type:

  mailstat $HOME/.procmail/log

This displays a concise version of your log file and moves your log 
file to log.old.  You may want to put the above line in your .login so that 
each time you log in you will see a listing of how many messages you've
received since the last time you ran mailstat, and what folders these
messages were delivered to.

You can get a mailstat listing of log.old by using the -o flag:

  mailstat -o $HOME/.procmail/log


If mailstat is not on your system ask your system administrator to
install it.  It is located with all the other procmail tools at:

ftp://ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/pub/packages/procmail/procmail.tar.gz

Subject: ... 2.4 Troubleshooting: Alternate .forward Files for Procmail

If the .forward template in 5b above doesn't work the following alternatives 
might be helpful:

In a perfect world:
	"|exec /usr/local/bin/procmail #nancym"
In an almost perfect world:
	"|exec /usr/local/bin/procmail USER=nancym"
In another world:
	"|IFS=' ';exec /usr/local/bin/procmail #nancym"
In a different world:
	"|IFS=' ';exec /usr/local/bin/procmail USER=nancym"
In a smrsh world:
	"|/usr/local/bin/procmail #nancym"

These formats can be tried in different combinations, the leading "| can
be tried as |" instead, or vice versa.

Some systems do not need a .forward file (i.e., having a .procmailrc file 
suffices if procmail already is the local delivery agent).

Subject: 3.0 Filter

Filter is part of the Elm package of tools.  Note that you can use filter
to filter your incoming mail even if you are not using Elm to read your mail.

IMPORTANT NOTE
==============
If your system has both procmail and filter installed then you should use 
procmail which is *much* more robust and powerful than filter.  This 
recommendation is almost universal; even the developers of Elm and Filter
recommend procmail over filter.  IT IS POSSIBLE TO LOSE MAIL MESSAGES
WHEN USING FILTER; this is rare but it has happened.

------------------------------

Date: 17 Nov 1994 23:03:10 GMT
From: Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: ... 3.1 Setting up Filter
Followup-To: comp.mail.elm

1] Find out if filter is on your system and what the full path to it is.  
   If you are using the C shell (csh) type:

     which filter

   Or, if you are using the Korn shell (ksh) or the Bourne shell (sh) type:

     type filter

   If neither ``which'' nor ``type'' are on your system try ``where'' and
   ``whereis''.  If your system doesn't have filter ask your system 
   administrator to install it; or even better ask her to install procmail.


2] Note the full path of your home directory by typing:

     cd
     pwd


3a] Create ~/.elm/filter-rules.  (Note that throughout this article I use
    pico for editing files.  Replace ``pico'' with your editor.)

     cd
     mkdir .elm
     cd .elm
     pico filter-rules

  
3b] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.elm/filter-rules

     if (subject contains "test") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.testing"
   
   Replace /j/nancym with your home directory path (see step 2).
   Replace /Mail with the name of the directory where your mail folders are
   stored.  Pine and Berkeley Mail use /mail (lower case m) and Elm uses 
   /Mail (upper case M).
   

4] To see what the filter rule will do type the following at your Unix 
   prompt:  

     filter -r


5a] Create a ~/.forward file by typing the following. (Pico's -w flag tells 
    pico not to auto wrap lines.)

      cd
      pico -w .forward


5b] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.forward:


     "|/usr/local/bin/filter -o /j/nancym/.elm/filter-errors"


    == IMPORTANT NOTES ==
    * Make sure you include the quotes (").
    * The vertical bar (|) is a pipe.
    * Replace /usr/local/bin with the correct path for filter (see step 1).
    * Replace /j/nancym with your home directory (see step 2).
   
    * Do NOT expect environment variables, like $HOME, to work in your 
      .forward file.
    * Do NOT expect ~ to mean your home directory in the .forward file.


5c] Note that on many systems you need to make your .forward is world 
    readable and your home directory world searchable in order for the
    mail transport agent to "see" it.  To do this type:
   
      cd
      chmod 644 .forward
      chmod a+x .


6] Send yourself two test messages: one with ``test'' in the subject
   and one without ``test'' in the subject.


7a] Start your mailer (pine, elm, etc.) and check that the messages
    were delivered correctly.  The one with ``test'' in the subject
    should be in the folder IN.testing and the one without ``test'' 
    in the subject should be in your inbox.  If these were delivered 
    correctly go on to step 8.


7b] TROUBLESHOOTING
    * If the two messages were not delivered correctly look at your
      ~/.elm/filter-errors to see if you can determine what the problem 
      is.  

    * Check these two files for typos:
        ~/.forward
        ~/.elm/filter-rules

    * Check the file and directory permissions of your .forward (set in 
      5c above).

      Type...          In order to...
      -------          --------------
      cd               Go to your home directory.
      
      ls -l .forward   Check the permission: it should say -rw-r--r--
      
      ls -ld .         Check permission of home dir: it should say drwx?-x?-x
                       The ?'s may be r's or hyphens or one of each (i.e.,
                       drwx--x--x, drwxr-xr-x, drwxr-x--x, drwx--xr-x).
      

    * If none of these turn up the problem edit your ~/.forward so
      that filter will be verbose with it's output (use the -vo flag).

        "|/usr/local/bin/filter -vo /j/nancym/.elm/filter-errors"

      And repeat steps 6 and 7.  After you get filter to work you 
      will probably want to change the ``-vo'' flag back to ``-o''.

   
8]  After you have successfully tested filter in steps 6 and 7, edit
    ~/.elm/filter-rules so that it contains a modified version of the
    following:

     # if (subject contains "test") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.testing"
     if (to contains "www-talk") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.www-talk"
     if (to contains "hopos-l") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.hopos"

     Replace /j/nancym with your home directory path and
     /Mail with the name of your mail directory.  Replace the mailing 
     list string (e.g., "www-talk") and the name of the mail folder
     (e.g., IN.www-talk) with text for your mailing lists.

     Note that ``to contains...'' means either the To or Cc header contains...

     Rather than deleting the test line, it's useful to just turn it
     into a comment (by preceding it with #) so that you can easily
     use it for future testing.

Subject: ... 3.2 Tracking Your Incoming Mail
Followup-To: comp.mail.elm

You can get a short summary of filter's activity by typing:

    filter -s

For a longer summary type:

    filter -S

Or you can look at the log file itself, ~/.elm/filterlog.

You should regularly look at ~/.elm/filter-errors to make sure things 
are working.  You can automatically check filter-errors each time you
log in by putting the following in your .login:

    tail ~/.elm/filter-errors

Also you probably want to regularly delete filterlog and filter-errors so 
they don't fill up your disk space.  To get a summary of the filter log and 
clear it type:

    filter -cs

  There are interactive programs which do not follow that approach.

Edit the .pinerc file in your home directory (eg "cd; pico .pinerc"),
move down to where it says "feature-list=" at the beginning of the line
and add "signature-at-bottom" to the end of line. Save. Quit. Done.

Any word on when 3.92 will be ready, also if it will be a while is there 
any reason to move from 3.90 (Solaris) ?

Is PINE or a program like PINE available for the MAC.  I am looking for a
telnet-able E-mail server software that works on a MAC.  I'd prefer to run
a server on the MAC platform, if at all possible.  Please send me E-mail. 
Thank You.

  This is with Pine 3.91. I had an Incoming Folder that I wanted to 
remove from this list. So I selected Delete, but this did actually
*physically* remove my folder!
  I think there is a bit of inconsistence in the interface: I can create
an incoming folder with Pine, but if I want to remove it from the
Incoming folder list *without* actually deleting it I have to edit 
manually .pinerc.
  Could this be changed in a future release?

could someone please tell me if there is a way to NOT mime-encode an

ASCII in the Relcom (Russian) newsgroups, but they can't read my 8th bit 
attachements because they are MIME encoded, and apparently that is not 
standard there yet, and I don't reckon I can ask every user in Russia to 
use a MIME unencoder to read my posts! ;) HELP!

thanks

The only way I can think of it to use two different executables with
different pine.conf values compiled.  You could either give the users 
different default path when they login so they find the different 
versions of pine, or simply name the versions differently and tell them
which one to use.  This would be enforceable with group permissions
if necessary.

Can you give an example of how, for example, I'd add in a type for an
Excel spreadsheet (file extension .XLS) so that if I asked to View that
file it would pull up excel as the viewer?  I understand the basics of
the mailcap file, but I don't understand how to add a new mime type so
that when the file is attached to the message, Pine knows to specify the
type as (for example) "application/excel".

Thanks....

If you have a file management area, mine is part of Lynx, you can just up 
load it using that program and your standard page up to activate your 
communications sofeware uploading mode. 

If not you will have to learn Unix commands (like DOS).

This should probably be a configurable option if things are changed.  For 
use at home for the convenience of others who read news there I don't 
want to see a list of the "new" newsgroups.

But here at work where I am a news administrator it is satisfying to see 
the list of groups that I think that I have added and to have the 
opportunity to easily subscribe to those that I want to observe traffic 
volume and the like.

Actually, yes, I've known about it for some time.  I have been neglectful and
never posted my patch (40 lashes are probably due me).  Try the patch I've
appended and see if it helps (it ought to!)

I can't help you on either of them, but I have to comment on the rather silly
way that HP terminals (and hpterms) do their highlighting.  The approach that HP
took is rather non-standard:  attribute characters actually take up space on the
screen, even though they're invisible. :-(

Our solution was to run pine from a shell script that invoked an xterm if it was
run from an hpterm.

No date has been set for 3.92 yet.  3.90 did have several bugs that were 
fixed in 3.91.

ok, I will post to pine-info my answer also,
it was not available at the time that message was posted, but on Apr 1st
(not a joke), I made an announcement on info-pmdf about the availablity 
of a standalone PICO, which I ported, but is NOT supported by Innosoft.
(there is also a port of PICO from the VMS port done by Yehavi.)

you can anonymous ftp to ftp.innosoft.com, and get the files

pico.olb	for people who don't have DEC C RTL (or pre VMS 6.0)
pico_link.com   for people who don't have DEC C RTL (or pre VMS 6.0)
pico_vax.exe	for people with DEC C RTL

pico_alpha.exe	for Alpha

Message-Id: <3m5qei$5m2@news4.primenet.com>

1) Anyone know if there is a complete documentation file (aka user's
manual) for Pine (Unix) and if so, its name and where I might be able
to find it?  I would prefer to study the program in total offline
rather than pop up generalized help screens while online.

2) When I first initialized Pine there was a welcome message and such
along with a question asking my if I wanted to receive a usage/tips
file (or words to that effect).  I said yes and shortly later received
this file in Pine.  The file was lost before I could get to it.  Does
anyone know where I can get a copy of this file?

3) Is there a configuration reason why I am automatically jetisoned
from Pine and returned to a system prompt after sending an email?  I
can find no such configuration setting yet when I write an email and
then send it, I'm thrown into a forced quit; i.e., I'm tossed out of
Pine and back at the system prompt.  I should think I would remain in
Pine until I explicitly quit, no?

Thanks.

Perfect!

This patch did the trick. Window sizing now works as expected.

and 

Using xterms instead of hpterms is a workable solution and is, in
fact, what I have been doing up to now.

Thank you,
Bob.

I was trying out the windows version of Pine.   *NOT* too 
bad.  *BUT*, the HELP menu could use a CLOSE feature, not 
just a MOVE.  I was able to exit by pressing down Ctrl & 
Enter.

I don't know if this is what you are looking for, but in your automated
update routine you could add the following:

pine -create_lu global_addressbook fullname-with-lists-last

This will regenerate the .lu file from the global_addressbook file.

At my installation I run both elm and pine and I really hate having to
maintain anything twice. So I have one file containing aliases (for elm)
and a makefile that creates all of the other files that I need for
all of the other mailers. Part of the make is the line that I've 
pasted above.

This input is worth exactly what you paid for it!

Pine seems to be missing the hangup signal from the parent shell process. 

I've got lots of users that will just hang up in the middle of a session,
leaving pine in a tight loop with a ppid of 1. Sometimes, pine will be in
the middle of creating tmp files and away it goes. I don't know the
particulars but, there were 26K editor tmp files this morning from one user.

I suspect pine.

We're talking:

HP-UX eagle A.09.04 D 9000/827 1770625161 64-user license

and

pine 3.91

Does anyone have a simple solution????
thanks,
Bill

   Get GNU "ispell" version 3.1.18 and install it on your system or check
   to see if you already have one. Other versions will work too.

   Set your alternate editor to "ispell" with the "S" option in the Main Menu
   so it looks like the following:

   editor=/usr/local/bin/ispell

   Once you've set it up, you can load ispell with "Ctrl-_". Ispell is a 
   powerful spell-checker.

   Good Luck.

Several other people have sent me mail with similar stories. None of the
hosts in question here have declared nntp servers in pine.conf, so the
problem we're seeing is not related to delays in opening a connection to
a nntp server. Any other suggestions would be welcome . . . .

Hello, does anybody know how I can access new mails from
the mail spool directory via the "#mh" switch as a remote
MH folder.
If I try "{imap-server}#mh/INBOX" only the existing mails (that
were read previously) are seen, but no new mails.

On the other side, if I set the incoming-folder to
"{imap-server}INBOX" new mails are seen but an error is
returned while saving read mails into a remote MH folder.
A directory is created, but no mail file can be written.

We would like to automate updating our global addressbook (it has 3500 
entries), so far we have successful updating the global addressbook file
but have not been able automate generating the addressbook.lu (index file)
that goes along with it.  Is there a way to do this? 

After the global addresbook is updated we have to run pine as root to
update the global addressbook index (file is read-only to all other users),
we are looking for a way around doing this.  Thanks.

I would like to configure PINE so that when I send out a message, a copy 
is sent under CC to a designated alias. The alias has already been setup 
in the addressbook. Any suggestions

Bob, thank you for your response re: PINE. I did receive a couple of 
replies and they seemed to work:

In the header put Read-Receipt-To: and I think Reply-Receipt-To: or 
Forward-Receipt-To: ...I forget which one but the person said to put both 
in the header.

So, I put these in my Custom Header, incorrectly thinking that they would 
only be invoked with I did the ^R for the "Rich Header" at the first 
level of Compose.....I started getting receipts from my own domain as 
well as other!....Not necessarily all, as this is up to the MTA at the far 
end, but enough that I knew something was wrong.

Now, apparently anything but in the "Custom Header's" applies to ALL mail 
even though you don't it in your composition header.

I was trying to have a default header with To:, Cc;, Bcc:, Attachment: and
Subject: 

Then under Rich Header. I wanted the full blown expansion is Receipts, 
Newsgroups, Expire, Reply to, Distribution and any other field that I may 
use. Some of these files like Receipt, would have my name@domain, others 
would be available for use.

So, now I have a different set of problems, namely trying to get this 
selective. If I can't find a way to enhance only the Rich Header, then it 
appears I will have to start PINE (3.91) with an alternate .pinerc file.

Thanx again,
Al

    It looks like there's nothing like a CERT advisory to get System 
Administrators to upgrade their versions of sendmail.  Unfortunately, not 
as many of them seem to follow up to bug-fix upgrades.
    This problem occurs when you are using Pine with BSD Sendmail 
v8.6.10, which was released to correct a security hole as mentioned in a 
CERT advisory.  However, there are a couple bugs in this sendmail, which 
were corrected and new versions of sendmail were released soon after 
(v8.6.11 and 8.6.12).
    Chances are, while your site was quick to upgrade upon release of the 
CERT advisory, they have not bothered to upgrade to fix the minor bugs 
that were introduced.  Ask them to get the latest release of BSD sendmail 
(v8.6.12) from the same site they got 8.6.10.
    If this does not fix the problem, then report this bug to 
comp.mail.sendmail.

    An an unrelated tangent, given that people seem to upgrade based on 
security advisories but don't bother to follow up by upgrading to bug-fix 
releases or added-feature releases, and given that BSD sendmail v8.7 will 
introduce 8BITMIME handling to permit guaranteed passing of 8 bit mail 
messages over ESMTP, it's my hope that there will be another security 
hole found shortly after a stable release of 8.7 which affects 8.6 
versions.  This way, sites which would not upgrade to 8.7 to support 
8BITMIME mail would go ahead and upgrade to plug a hole, with the side 
benefit of adding 8BITMIME support.  My feeling is that non-US sites 
would upgrade pretty quickly to support their needs for 8-bit data in 
mail, but it will take some crisis to give 8BITMIME the widespread use 
that it needs to be really useful.
    Pine3.92 will take advantage of ESMTP servers with support for 
8BITMIME by sending unaltered 8-bit data to them, meaning it would be 
possible for a message to be sent from Pine to another site without being 
converted to MIME quoted-printable encoding.

Hallo!=20

I am trying to use pcpine for Winsocks uder MS Windows. I prepared
cp_to_iso and iso_to_cp tables for ISO 8859-2 and IBM code page 852, but I
have problem with some characters, for example `s' and `z' with caron
(\v{s} and \v{z} in TeX notation, `=B9' and `=BE' in ISO 8869-2). It seems =
to
me the tables are correct and sending a message containing these two
characters to a Unix machine and then bouncing it back to Winsock pine
shows everything O. K. I don't know how MS Windows functions OEMtoANSI and
ANSItoOEM work, so maybe there is a problem somewhere there.=20

If you have ANY sugestions, they are greatly welcomed.=20

Thanks
   V. S.

P. S.  I sends these two conversion files as attachments.

Message-Id: <D6up7E.C5v@news.hawaii.edu>

I am new to this newsgroup -- so, don't flaim me if this question has 
been asked 10,000 times previously. ;)

I would like Pine to compress my mail in each of my folders as it stores 
the mail messages and then decompress a mail message if I want to read it.

Is this possible?  A good chunk of disk space is taken up with mail in 
various folders that I want to keep.  If there were some way to compress 
this mail without making it unreadable to Pine, that would be great!

Thanks for any help you can provide,

Art

This problem occurs sporadically at our site.  It only seems to happen when 
our NNTP server goes/slows down.

Just go into PICO, blank page, type whatever you want your plan to say, 
then save it as file name .plan

You have to put the . in
No spaces, no Caps

You can also make a .project file the same way

Hello,

I'd like to setup a postoffice in which my users get pine as their default 
shell. However, I want to disable shell escapes and printing.

Is this possible with 3.91 or do I need to hack the code myself ?

Thanks in advance,

Hans

The first part of this address ("@gatekeeper.mcimail.com:") indicates that
the message should be routed via 'gatekeeper'.  This is an obsolete way of
specifying a mailing address.  It is permitted by the standard, but it is
rarely seen and its use is explicitly discouraged. 

If you leave off the routing prefix, you get

    sn=name%g=first%o=cs_first_boston%dda=id=csfbg+pnameb%csfbg@mcimail.com

which, though ugly, should be accepted by Pine.

 PINE can't do it but a shell sctipt can.

 Suppose all your folders are in "/usr/people/pollarda/mail" and the
 PINE binary is in "/usr/local/bin". Set the FDIR variable to where
 your actual folders are if the above is not correct.

 Create the following file and name it "Pine" do a "chmod +x Pine" and 
 invoke it with "./Pine"

 ---------------cut here---------------

 #!/bin/sh
 FDIR=/usr/people/pollarda/mail
 for i in $FDIR/*

   uncompress $i

You should remain.  Dunno why this is happening ... something in your

I recently made a post asking someting simmilar.  I think a better solution
would be to change the code to make pine to uncompress (gunzip) only
the mail folder that you are accessing, and when you are done would 
gzip it back up in the background when your done with it.  Would be 
transparent to the user except for a minor delay when opening a mail
folder.  If I had some extra time I'd do it, but was hoping someone

If you'll write the code, I'll buy it for $5.  If enough of us would, 
would it be worth your time?  There are a lot of Pine users.

[ hosseino@yu1.yu.edu (Joshua Hosseinoff) wrote the following on "comp.mail.pine": ]

-> names (over 200) on the CC line.  Now any time someone who has that 
-> message in his inbox goes into Pine, pine will immediately abort and core 
-> dump.  We're running 3.91a on AIX 3.2 RS6k if that helps.  

  The problem is because the system is running BSD Sendmail v8.6.10.
  You can ask your sys-admins to upgrade to 8.6.11 oe 8.6.12, I believe this problem 
  will be solved once it's done. Meanwhile configure Pine to use an SMTP-server, 
  rather than passing your mail to sendmail directly. This bug was generated
  when sendmail was patched to plug a security hole.

  Here's how you can configure PINE

  1. Goto the main menu by pressing "M".

  2. Choose "S" for SetUp.

  3. Type "C" for "Config".

  4. Bring down the highlighting bar to the "SMTP server" line and
     add the following entry so the line looks like this:

     smtp-server            = mail.yu1.yu.edu


  Make sure the name of your SMTP server is correct, the above is only
  a guess.

  This will hopefully solve your problem.

I've had the same problem you speak of when using pine as a newsreader.  
My solution was to run tin first.  Have you tried adding (subscribing) to 
a newsgroup without a .newsrc file in $HOME?  Maybe that will create a 
.newsrc file.

Good luck

I was wondering.  Is it possible to filter mail from your INBOX to 
different "inboxes"?  For instance.  I receive alot of mail from the 
localhost "ashland.edu" can I filter that mail into a "ashland" box?  
Could I filter @aol" mail into another box?  If so please tell me how, I 
think it would help me clean up the clutter!

This is unclear.  Does this account for slowness in non-IMAP situations
also?  Are there updated binaries available, since a lot of people just get
binaries from your ftp site.

Hi.  Somebody from UCS at Indiana University posted a message about a 
slow open of the INBOX with Pine 3.91, on all the platforms he had 
compiled it on.  I have noticed this, too, both on our dept. HP735's, 
Suns, and my FreeBSD PC at home.

I think that the problem has to do with the NNTP software.  Try setting 
the NNTP-server to <Empty Value> and running pine again.  I believe that 
you'll notice that the lag is gone.  I must admit that I found this by 
mistake, but I'm pretty sure that this is it.

Hope this helps.

I am currently using PINE to read news from an NNTP server over a dial up
slip connection. It's not too slow but I would like to download the news 
items and read them offline. What I have is a slip connection and full 
terminal access to an internet host. (In other words I can access just 
about anything).

Can anyone help me?

Please e-mail a reply to cwelect@ozemail.com.au.

There is a really easy way. Instead of typing in the 25-30 names on the 
"To:" line, enter them on the "Bcc:" line. Everyone will get the mail, but 
they wont see any names in the header (including their own name). This 
also prevents people who reply to you from accidentally replying back to 
everyone. The "Bcc:" line is available as part of the Rich Header, which 
comes up in pine if you hit ^R when the cursor is in the header of the 
mail that you intend to send. If you absolutely want something to appear 
in the "To:" line, type in something like this:

To: Various_People <you@your.email.address>
Bcc: (25-30 adddresses here. No parentheses.)

That way, a copy will go to you in addition to everyone else, and 
something will appear in the "To:" line which will seem reasonable to the 
uninformed. The informed will no doubt figure out what you did and not 
worry about it. 


				Ian Ollmann

An alternate way is to send the mail to a dummy account with a .forward
with all 25-30 names listed one per line in it, or investigate one of the
many varieties of mail servers for creation of a mailing list.

On my systems, I always configure sendmail with
FEATURE(always_add_domain) turned on.  I suppose I should lobby to
make it the default.

A message which does not travel across the network does not
necessarily have to conform to any network standards, such as the RFC
822 message format.  In the case of many traditional unix mail
systems, messages which remain local to the host contain address
information in a form which does not conform to 822.

This is not as serious a problem as taking messages that arrived from
the network and changing them such that they no longer conform to 822,
which a previous message from you indicated that zmailer did.

The IMAP server should not be modifying the content of the messages it
hands out.  In this situation, it has been given a message with
addresses which do not conform to 822.  It can interpret them the best
it can, for purposes of computing the IMAP4 ENVELOPE data item, but it
should not make a bad situation worse by trying to rewrite the
headers.

Yes, it would be a very good idea.  In sendmail v8, you can do this by
putting FEATURE(always_add_domain) in the mc file you use to generate
the cf file.

As you seem to have found out, in today's environments, "local"
information tends not to stay local.  Addresses should be sent in
fully-qualified network-standard form.

Perhaps it would be in order for the next version of pine to have a 
configurable option to allow ;aadx (delete and expunge all messages) when 
reading newsgroups, but not when reading your INBOX, or at least to 
double query you on your inbox.  I accidentally deleted my whole inbox a 
couple of weeks ago with over 300 messages in it at the time.  
Fortunately I knew what most of the important pending material was at the 
time, but the reason it happened was because I was just reading 
newsgroups before and when it brought me back to INBOX after the last 
newsgroup out of habit I just hit ;aadx and voila it was all gone.
Just a suggestion.

You want this to be permanent?  I use, under Customized headers,
a Bcc: to the designated address.  Works fine for me.

Well I tried setting the nntp-server value to both "" and empty but it
didn't make a difference. Both settings take about 40 secs (including
login). There may be some difference between our systems.

In any case, this wouldn't be much of a solution to those who actually 
have a nntp-server.

: Why not?  One is readily available.

But why?

If the 8th bit is delivered correct and not cut off by some stupid gateways,
there is no need to put an ordinary ISO-8859-X text into 'quoted-printable'.
I'd like to turn that off, too.

I can see the use of m[un]pack when sending pics, sound-files or similar,
but an ordinary letter containing Umlauts should not end up in a rather
unreadable thing with = made into =3D, end-of-lines looking like =20, lines
broken up at different positions than I intended or other ugly things.

Pine has a lot of nice features, but I would like to decide when to use
them myself. At least I would like to be warned that the message going off
is in a format my counterpart may not be able to read.

    You're seeing the results of MIME's quoted-printable encoding, which 
is what Pine uses when the mail it is trying to send has some 8-bit data 
in it.  (Technically, the =20 you see is not a newline but the space 
character at the end of the line.)
    Send a sample of a message you're trying to send.  I don't see 
anything in your .signature or elsewhere that would trigger this 
encoding, so it would help to see an actual message so we could point out 
what non-ASCII chatacter it is which causes Pine to do this.

I was using tin.
I was trying to delete an empty message from a newsgroup and wound up 
blocking myself and all articles from myself from that newsgroup by 
hitting ^K-kill/select.  How do I undo what I've done?  I've sent 3 messages 
but none of them has posted. How do I use this function to avoid this in 
the future? Also how do I get back all the postings that's been deleted?
Example-- newsgroup shows 74 entries- when I open the group the listing 
shows maybe 4/5 new postings.   When I hit (R) to toggle re/unread groups,
my postings or articles still won't show.  Help me please.............
Thank you.........................................

It would be nice if Pine set a separate 'F' flag on those messages that have
been forwarded (or bounced).  Is that possible or is there some limitation
in the underlying IMAP stuff?  I regularly have to forward received messages
on to others for comment before answering the sender and it's sometimes 
difficult to keep track of which messages I've forwarded.

I suppose that I could get round this by manually setting  the 'Important'
flag on messages (I don't currently use that flag in its intended way) or by
moving messages between folders to keep track of which have been forwarded
but it seems a bit messy?

One other thing...  in Pine 3.91 the 'Deleted' flag moves with a message
if you save it into another folder.  This seems a little crazy since the
most common time this happens is when you have previously marked a message
for deletion but then decide that you didn't really want to do that and
save it to another folder instead? 

How about a clear-delete-flag-on-save option?

Thanks,

Andy.

It accounts for the slowness in accessing an mbox format folder.  In 
non-IMAP situations, it is local file access to an mbox format folder.  In 
IMAP situations, it is the IMAP server's local file access to an mbox 
format folder.

We only release pre-built binaries for source releases of Pine.  We do 
not release development sources or pre-built binaries from development 
sources.  So, there will be no pre-built binaries with this fix until 
3.92 is released.

The IMAP toolkit is also distributed separately as 
	ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/imap.tar.Z
That distribution reflects the very latest version of our development 
sources, for the benefit of other non-Pine IMAP toolkit developers.  
Often it is updated multiple times a day.  For this reason, it is not 
practical to offer pre-built binaries for the IMAP toolkit, except as 
part of a Pine release.

The Eudora/PINE saga continues...

I got Email from Steve Dorner (sdorner@qualcomm.com), the author of
Eudora, who said that Eudora will recognize text files sent as PINE
attachments as attachments on the condition that the header of the
ATTACHMENT contains the following line:
Content-Disposition: attachment
For example:
---1044512224-2078917053-797701623=:26036
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; name="cnthermofin.tex"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: BASE64
Content-ID: <Pine.A32.3.91.950412174703.26036B@kirk.luc.ac.be>
Content-Disposition: attachment
Content-Description:

XGRvY3VtZW50c3R5bGVbYXBzLHByZXByaW50LHByYl17cmV2dGV4fQ0KJSAx
aW4gbWFyZ2lucyBhdCBsZWZ0IGFuZCByaWdodA0KXG9kZHNpZGVtYXJnaW49
MGluDQpcZXZlbnNpZGVtYXJnaW49MGluDQpcdGV4dHdpZHRoPTYuMjY3N2lu
[etc etc]

So the problem is reduced to finding a way to insert custom attachment
headers. Any idea if this can be done in pine? Many thanks in advance.

Be well,

Hi, All! My PINE seems to be erasing the messages from the newsgroups 
one	 week after they are posted. Does anybody know how I can change

We don't know when 3.92 will be ready yet, but I do recommend upgrading to
3.91, since 3.90 has some bugs that can cause loss of your addressbook,
etc.

Andy,
The IMAP4 spec does define a small fixed set of message flags, but also 
allows for the possibility of some client-defined flags.  Pine does not
currently support the latter class of flags, but we may add that after we 
have everything upgraded to the IMAP4 spec...

As for preserving the deleted flag on Save: we agree, and this will be 
fixed in 3.92.

I am having a problem with our from lines. It seems that pine wants to put 
either the hostname or domain name at the end of incoming mail address. Our mail
comes in via uucp so the addressing is bang style, but if I could get it to
be domain style I would be happy as well. The varying behaviour is related to
if I have the user-domain= set to our local domain or not. If it is set then
it uses the domain name  and if not it uses the system name. 

Any pointer would be great.

Hi.  I just subscribed to this group, and this is my first post.  I have 
been using Pine for a number of months to manage my mail.  It is much 
more efficient and friendly then Unix Mail, especially where the editor 
is concerned.

Until now, I have continued to use Tin to read and post to newsgroups; in 
fact, I am in it right now.  For the first time, I seriously used Pine to 
read news a few days ago.  In some ways, it is better than Tin, making 
articles similar to mail messages, and using simple commands.  There is 
one thing, however, which poses a problem for me, and I am wondering if 
Pine has a way to handle it.  In Tin, articles and their responses are 
chronologically arranged in threads, so that it is easy to follow a 
discussion.  This is particularly useful when I have posted a new 
article, and am waiting for a response.  It seems that in Pine, the 
articles are placed randomly, and in an index of hundreds of articles, 
those with the same name are spread far apart.  Is there a way that Pine 
can be configured to organize news into threads?  Also, is there a search 
command in the index?  Once I have information, I can decide whether or 
not to switch.  Hope to hear from you soon.

Date: Thu, 13 Apr 1995 04:48:58 GMT
Message-Id: <3miag4$7gp@news.primenet.com>

Okay here is my problem..... I have a lot of wyse 30, 60 and 160
terminals out there.... I want to use Pine for the e-mail interface.
I know that the FAQ mentions that it won't support these terminals (at
least when it comes to the arrow key functions).  I figured out that I
can used the VT-100 commands (i.e. ^[[A,B,C,D) to manipulate the
cursor.

What I would like to do is run a shell script before executing pine
that would program the arrow keys to send back these strings.  When
pine is finished executing, it would restore the arrow keys to their
default mode.  I can't get this to work.  It works great if I am
manually setting them in SETUP mode, however when I script it I am
having no luck.  

Does anybody have any ideas?  Has anybody accomplished this little
feat?  I would appreciate any help.  Please e-mail me and let me know.

Thanks.

the bottom of the email that you are sending? ( I have seen it done

Sorry if I missed it in the manual.  People have been complaining about
long "To" lists in their messages.  Often, a two or three line message

there any way of telling pine to send stuff out to a distribution list

Actually they probably have posted, but you can't read them because you

Don't kill yourself.

 Also how do I get back all the postings that's been deleted?

Theyre not deleted (from the usenet group) you just can't read them.

: shows maybe 4/5 new postings.   When I hit (R) to toggle re/unread groups,
: my postings or articles still won't show.  Help me please.............

OK I'm gonna try, but if you don't understand any of this or don't feel 
comfortable doing it, don't try it or you could scew something else up.  
Open up a file (with pico or any text editor that you feel comfortabe 
with) file named .kill (must have the . in the file name).  Now you 
should see the .kill file in text ascii form.  If not, quit (cancel or 
exit without saving or whatever).  If you do see it, delete the line (or 
lines) which you put there by mistake (in pico, put the cursor on the 
line and hit ^K (control+K).  Then resave the file with the 
same name (.kill).  Depending on your text editor you may be prompted if 
you want to overwrite the existing file or something.  Don't feel bad, I 
did the same thing myself, that's why I'm so smart on how to fix it.  
There may be an easier way, maybe someone else out there in cyberspace 
has a better answer.  BYE

Put the cursor in the header area and hit control+r.  This is called the 
'rich header'.  Now put all your addresses in the BCC: field which stands 
for Blind Carbon Copy.  No one sees anyone else's address when they 
receive their mail.

You need to use Pine's "sort" command: $

Open up the newsgroup (or mail folder) you want to read.  Type "$" and 
you will get a menu offering various criteria for sorting the messages.

The best criterion for Usenet News is Ordered Subject (O).  This sorts 
first by subject field (getting related messages together), with a 
secondary sort key of the date (sorting the related messages into 
chronological order by the date and time they were posted.

When you close the folder the sorting is forgotten, so my instinctive 
reaction upon opening a newsgroup in Pine is "$O".

If you find this useful you can make it the default sorting option in the 
Setup (S) Configuration (C) screen, accessed from Pine's Main Menu.  
Note, however, that this default currently affects *all* folders be they 
news or mail.  Whilst I find Ordered Subject sorting great for News 
Collection folders I prefer Arrival sorting for ordinary folders, so 
leave my default as Arrival sorting.

The whole idea of headers is that they are *headers*... they appear at 
the *head* of something.  In this case the mailbox format used by most 
mail systems and readers (including Pine) tends to be that known as 
"Berkeley format".  This is defined as having the "header" information at 
the start of the message followed by the message text.

What you *really* want to do is suppress the huge list of usernames.

You can do this in Pine by *not* using the "To:" header field to give the 
list of recipients.  Instead type Ctrl/R (Rich Headers) to get some extra 
header fields displayed.  Then put the list of recipients in the "Bcc:" 
field.

"Bcc" stands for "Blind Carbon Copy".  This is a way of sending a message 
to a number of people, but who each only see their own name as a 
recipient -- they don't see each others.

A couple of points to note...

*  For Bcc to work properly the mail delivery agent (the thing which 
writes the message into the file as it arrives, as against Pine which 
"simply" is used for reading the messages once they have been written 
into the file) being properly configured.  If someone's "sendmail" 
delivery agent, for example, isn't configured properly they'll still get 
the full list of names (but then that's *their* problem:-)

*  The recipients can Reply to the message, but their repliy will only 
come to you, not to every one else you sent the original message to (as 
the recipient doesn't get to know about them, so can't reply to them!:-)

While this is the recommended method in pine for sending mail via pine's
internal aliases, note that there are (at least) two sendmail issues
that may cause the addresses in the mailing list to be visible to
recipients. 

1) Sendmail strips the Bcc: field from outgoing messages. If your
message has no address in the To: header, the message arrives at the
target host with no header To: field (which violates RFC 822). The
receiving sendmail thus adds an Apparently-To: line for every recipient.
Most mailers filter out this header, but if yours doesn't (or if it
offers a "raw header" option) - whoops, you see all the addresses to
which the message was Bcc:'ed . Obviously this can cause a great deal of
embarassment in some circumstances. The current solution is to always
put something in the To: field - a dummy address, even an RFC 822
comment like (My-Mailing-List). (This handling of Bcc: has always been a
problem and various alternatives are being discussed on the sendmail
beta list.)

2) Older versions of sendmail (basically anything prior to Berkeley V8)
maintain a fixed buffer for headre contents, the size of which is
determined at compile time. A very long mailing list may cause
sendmail's header buffer to overflow, with the overflow being insert
into the message (and flagged as overflow). This has also caused much
embarassment when it reveals to the world the contents of a supposedly
"secret" Bcc:

V8 dynamically allocates buffers for message headers, so this problem
goes away. Few vendors ship V* sendmail however, so it is a problem to
be aware of.

Obviously these are sendmail issues but I thought it might be worth
mentioning them.

The current version at HUJI seems to be BETA_4.  Did you use that?
I can only respond to a few of your questions from my own experience,
which was done first with a fixed version of BETA_3, and later with
BETA_4, using native MULTINET  (which is of course different in some
ways from using any other TCP stack and NETLIB).

It works for me, although I find I prefer to use the Madison NEWSRDR
that I have already been familiar with on the VMS platform.

No, adding a group with a known name works fine for me, and      ]
requesting list of all groups gives a massive list that looks
reasonable to me.

I don't think so.  I just did a test for you, renaming .newsrc to
.somethingelse and restarting (HUJI)PINE.  It gave me the same display as
we already discussed.  I subscribed to a group (uk.test) and it said
"Creating news state SYS$LOGIN:.newsrc".

Well,  I get different results.  It works fine for me when I
define smtp_server (pointing back at the same VAX system where I'm
running PINE, just like Yehavi's example in the README.VMS), but
it didn't work when I tried the other method.  I didn't go into
details about why it didn't work, sorry.

Well all that I can say is that it works for me, using MULTINET.
I can only suggest that the first place you should look for problems
is your NETLIB, but as I didn't use that myself, I can't say more.
 
Anyway, if you have a method that works, what is your problem?  ;-)

Selection criteria.  You need to enable the aggregate-command-set
option before the "; Select" command becomes available, I think.
 
I don't suppose you get precisely the same selection criteria in
PINE than are available in VMS MAIL, but after all, you don't use the
ability to execute MAIL when you want to use its particular functions...
 
hope this helps.  You can also look at my Web page on this:

mail, and pine 3.91 in an xterm to read it.  A lot of the time when mail
arrives while pine is running, I get a message like "inbox closed due to
access error, consult an expert" or "mailbox format invalidated" and I
have to quit and restart pine.  (I've probably misquoted the error
messages, but I hope you get the idea.)

Anyone have a similar problem (and a solution)?

The next release of Pine will be able to negotiate 8bit c-t-e for text if
your MTA understands ESMTP 8BITMIME.

I've been trying to send a rather large file to a rather long distribution
list and I keep getting different sh ##### : Bus Errors. The number I've
gotten so far are 16000, 13434 and most recently 12760. I tried cutting my
distribution list down from 75 to 60, as someone suggested pine couldn't
handle that many addresses at once, but I just get different error numbers.
Can someone tell me what these numbers mean and how I might be able to fix
this problem? Thanks.

Andrew,


You can send a mail message to  listserv sites on the internet.  
Leave the subject line blank and on the first line of the message, 
write   LIST GLOBAL.   The listserv software should mail you back a 
list of all internet listserv discussion lists. You should be able to 
mail our listserv and acquire that if you like.  Send E-mail to 
listserv@uafsysb.uark.edu.

I'm not really sure as to how different software such as majordomo 
handles this kind of request.

Hope this helps,

Hi, I'm trying to set up a mini-listserver at work with Pine and Filter.  

Basically, I'm trying to get Filter to bounce every message with "lab" in 
the subject to a mailing list.

Rather than having to manually type every address in my filter-rules 
file, is there anyway Filter can take advantage of Pine's address book?

Thanks!

There is a known problem in Pine 3.91 relating to slow opening of mbox
format mail files.  The algorithm itself is OK, but certain C compilers
are known to generate code which runs very slowly.  So I changed the 
algorithm to an equivalent one which doesn't cause the problem.

This problem is fixed in the latest IMAP toolkit, 
	ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap.tar.Z
Remove the imap/ directory tree in your Pine sources, and replace it with 
this new toolkit, then rebuild Pine.

You can only do it BEFORE you quit PINE.
If I recall, the delete command is d, the undelete command is u.
That's why when you go to quit you get a prompt something like 'expunge 
the 4 deleted messages from inbox? Y/N?.  If you answer Y it quits, and 
they're gone.  If you answer N, they are not deleted, but they are still 
marked to delete, and the same thing will happen again next time you try 
to quit.  Once they're gone, they're gone, UNIX does not have an 
'undelete' command, as does DOS for example.   BYE

Hiya...have a question. I have two email addresses on different systems, 
and am currently using a .foward file to send messages from the one I use 
rarely to the one I use every day. What I want to know, is there another 
type of file that will transparantly only COPY the message to my current 
.foward address while leaving it still at the original site?

I read a FAQ or two and didn't see this addressed... :)

TIA,
Daws

Is there any way to force pine to search the entire message and not just the

when I receive email addresses of people as part of a message.

Thanks,

Can anyone tell me why I am able to read some newsgroups, but not 
others?  I was able to read alt.cad.autocad and alt.architucture until 
recently, but now pine tells me "No state for newsgroup found, reading as 
new".  I have several other newsgroups that still read o.k., so I assume 
there is a problem with these groups.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Hi, 

I think I've read similar questions before, but I can't remember the 
answer. I really want to know if there is an easier way to maintain my 
address book. Say, I have a file with a bunch of e-mail address in it, 
how can I add them into my address book? Using editor doesn't work. It 
seems the address book for 'pine' has some special format not just
plain text. Also if I want to add someone's address to an existing list, 
what else can I do instead of typing them one by one?

Thanks a lot in advance.

Where you *should* look is under the manpages for sendmail. The .forward
is a function of sendmail, not pine. Anyway, you can do a lot with a
.forward. I think what you want is to change your .forward from: 

drambo@primenet.com

to something like this:

\drambo, drambo@primenet.com

If this is installed on your cloud9 account, then a copy will be kept in 
the INBOX for drambo@cloud9.com (\drambo) and another copy sent to 
drambo@primenet.com (drambo@primenet.com). A copy of the relevant section 
of the manpages for sendmail follows:

FORWARDING MAIL USING SENDMAIL
     As a personal alternative to aliasing, a user may put a file with the
     name .forward in his home directory.  If this file exists, sendmail
     redirects mail for that user to the list of recipients in the .forward
     file.  The recipients listed in the .forward file may be separated by
     commas or new-lines.  Programs and files are valid recipients.  For
     example, if user ``jane'' has a .forward file containing:

        jd@company.com
        /usr/tmp/mail.log
        |/usr/local/bin/mymailer


     sendmail will redirect all incoming messages for ``jane'' to
     ``jd@company.com'', append a copy of the message to the file
     /usr/tmp/mail.log (if it has o+w permissions) and pipe a copy of the mes-
     sage to standard input of /usr/local/bin/mymailer.  The user may redirect
->   mail to himself in addition to sending it on to other destinations.  This
->   is particularly useful in the event that the user wishes to continue to
->   receive mail in his own mailbox while passing copies of each incoming
->   message on to some alternative destination.  For example, if the home
     directory for user ``john'' contains a .forward file with contents:

        \john, "|/usr/sbin/vacation john"

     sendmail will append each incoming message to ``john'''s regular mailbox
     and send a copy of each message to the /usr/sbin/vacation program.

The development info www page says that the current version of Pine is 
3.90 and that future versions will include PEM (whatever that is) and/or 
PGP support.   I seem to be using version 3.91.  Is it possible that I 
have access to PGP and don't know it?  

Since this is probably too good to be true, Is there a simple way to 
increase privacy on a UNIX-based multiuser system?

Same here. MIME Quoted-Printable causes lots of problems here in Finland,=

too. Pine is an excellent and versatile program but has caused lots of=20
irritation here because of the =3DE4 etc. characters that get in the messag=

8bit characters are handled properly but QP is not.

I share this opinion. The most serious computing professionals don't like
Pine at all because it just can't handle our special letters (=E4=F6=E5=DF =
etc)=20
in a way that is compatible with rest of our software.

Usually, you can re-alias whatever command it is which brings up an empty
shell to something which includes an automatic first command to be
executed within that shell. This command can be /usr/bin/pine or perhaps a
shell script to set a few environment variables first and then starts up
pine. The actual implementation of this is somewhat system specific as how
different OS's deal with windows/menus/etc is different.  However, if you
can find the default file is for defining the format and function of 
whatever tool the user uses to call forth his shell, you can modify it to 
do whatever you deem necessary. For example, in IRIX 4.0.5 on a silicon 
graphics machine, /usr/lib/X11/system.chestrc defines the contents and 
function of the main set of pulldown menus, from which the user gets 
new shells. From the pulldown menu, Tools, the user can select "Shell" to 
get a new shell. You can change /usr/lib/X11/system.chestrc from:

...
Menu Tools
{
    "Shell"  		f.checkexec 	"/usr/sbin/winterm"
    "Manual Pages"  	f.checkexec 	"/usr/bin/X11/xman" 
    "Release Notes"  	f.checkexec 	"/usr/sbin/grelnotes" 
    (more stuff...)
}
...


to something which looks like this:

...
Menu Tools
{
    "Shell"  		f.checkexec 	"/usr/sbin/winterm -c /bin/csh -c /usr/bin/pine"
    "Manual Pages"  	f.checkexec 	"/usr/bin/X11/xman" 
    "Release Notes"  	f.checkexec 	"/usr/sbin/grelnotes" 
    (more stuff...)
} 
...

The -c option for winterm, rsh or csh is common for use to feed the rest
of the line in as the first command to be executed by the new cshell or in
the winterm. You will find that pine doesn't work very well without
environment variables such as MAIL set, so you may wish to replace
"/usr/bin/pine", above, with the path to a small shell script which
defines the necessary environment variables. The last command in this
shell script can be /usr/bin/pine (or equivalent). In have no idea how to
deal with the problem of handling user login. Perhaps it can be dealt with
within the confines of the shell script. You probably don't want users to
be able to read each other's mail, do you? When using a setup like this,
when I exit pine, the window closes itself automatically. (I didn't have
to do anything or include any special commands for this to happen). So,
shell escapes may not be a problem for you. As to how to disable printing,
I'm not sure whether it is best to make a small hack to pine or just set
up pine with an incorrect printing command and hope that users aren't
savvy enough to figure out how to edit their own .pinerc to fix the
problem.  Good luck.

This is kindof obvious, but there is a marked slowdown if the user's 
inbox is really large -- say, for example, he/she never deletes any mail. 
We have had users that receive entire newspapers as mail every day and 
never delete any of them. The inbox can grow to be several MB in a few 
months. We have also had this slowdown problem when our NNTPSERVER goes 
down. The user can also declare an NNTPSERVER in .pinerc. Pine-help is 
sufficiently detailed for many to do this themselves.

Hello everybody!

In Pine Technical Notes, section "International Character Sets",
it states that PC-Pine supports translation from for several
Latin character sets (CP850, CP860, CP863 and CP865 to ISO-8859-1 
and vice versa), as well for the Cyrillic (CP866 to ISO-8859-5).
Is the same support built-in also for Latin-2, ie. is it only the
question of correct ISO_TO_CP and CP_TO_ISO tables, or are there
any changes in the main program neccessary?

Best regards,

Primoz.

Subject: Some problems being faced in PINE 3.91 under VMS
Message-Id: <1995Apr12.134937.410@kuc01.kuniv.edu.kw>
Date: Wed, 12 Apr 95 10:49:21 GMT  

Sorry to bother you all on this group. I recently installed PINE 3.91 under
VMS 5.5-2 & UCX 2.0E, which I got from VMS.HUJI.AC.IL. It is a wonderful
package & lot of effort has been done to port it to VMS. In genearal it works
fine for me but I am facing some problems described as under:

1. Creating of mail message, attaching a GIF or PS file & sending it works fine
   On receiving end, I can receive normal text mail & also GIF attachments
   (sent by PINE & encoded in BASE64) but retrieving .PS attachment gives
   message "Don't know how to display attachment Apllication/POSTSCRIPT".
   I created a .mailcap file with following entries:

   Application/POSTSCRIPT; gv %s;
   application/postscript; gv %s;

   I have ghostscript & ghostscript on my site & I can use GV to view .PS
   files outside PINE. Is it possible that MAILCAP facility is not implemented
   in VMS port. I compiled PINE with DEBUG & default debug 9. In debug files
   it only shows entries for mailcap_free & not for mc_init, mailcap:
   process_file ,mc_get_entry etc which are routines for building the mailcap
   entries in memory (possibly). From this it seems that PINE ( VMS port) does
   not support mailcap facility (Kindly correct me if I am wrong & let me know
   where am I making mistake -- may be format of entries in my .mailcap file is
   incorrect).

2. I have no luck with NEWS also, though I have declared nntp_server as my
   machine kuc01.kuniv.edu.kw (which is an NNTP server which we are using
   locally). When, I go to list of folders under PINE, it shows me:

   News-collection <News on kuc01.kuniv.edu.kw>   (Remote)

   [ ** Empty List ** Select Here to Try Re-expanding]

   [Now in collection <News on kuc01.kuniv.edu.kw>]

   Attempt to add any group which I read regularly (by FNEWS program which is
   an NEWS client on our own machine), says

   [News Group doesn't exist]

   If I try to match All Grps it says [No groups to select from!]

   The following messages are logged into .PINE-DEBUG1


          nntp-server : kuc01.kuniv.edu.kw
   is_list: name=nntp-server
          nntp-server : kuc01.kuniv.edu.kw
          nntp-server : kuc01.kuniv.edu.kw
   Context *{kuc01.kuniv.edu.kw/nntp}[] type: REMOTE BBOARD OLDTECH
   ***** context *{kuc01.kuniv.edu.kw/nntp}[]
   find_folders_in_context: *{kuc01.kuniv.edu.kw/nntp}[]
   find_folders: mail_open(*{kuc01.kuniv.edu.kw/nntp}) FAILED.

   Can some body suggest me why all these messages & why the list of news
   groups is empty even though I use FNEWS happily ? Do I need to create
   .newsrc or newsrc. file manually & what is format for the entries in it?

3. Though I am able to send/receive mail using PINE by setting logical
   name PINE_MAIL_PROTOCOL as SMTP but if I define smtp_server as our
   machine (kuc01.kuniv.edu.kw & deassign PINE_MAIL_PROTOCOL), I get
   message:

   [Error connecting to mail server: ]

   What is the difference between the above two mechanisms (ie defining
   PINE_MAIL_PROTOCOL but no SMTP_SERVER & not defining PINE_MAIL_PROTOCOL
   but setting smtp_server)? Why the first mechanism works but the second
   does not work (even though TELNET KUC01.KUNIV.EDU.KW 25 works fine & I
   am able to log into SMTP interactively)?

4. I could not find a way in PINE (possibly did not read documentation
   carefully) to select only some mail items in a mail folder based on
   date,from etc? Under VMS mail, this can be done by DIR/SINCE,DIR/FROM
   etc. Can some body suggest, how can I achive this in PINE?

5. Is there any way in PINE by which I can send mail to user on my machine
   with out using SMTP (ie all local mail to be handled by VMSMAIL)? In 
   .PINE-DEBUG1 I find the following settings:

    Local Domain name being used ""
    Host name being used ""
    Mail Domain name being used (by c-client too) "kuc01.kuniv.edu.kw"

   Why Local Domain name & Host name are "" & can this will cause all mail
   to go via SMTP rather than VMSMAIL? If yes, how can I correct this 
   situation? I have defined user-domain as kuc01.kuniv.edu.kw in my
   .pinerc file.

6. I see the following information in .pinerc-debug1:
 
   Context SYS[] type: LOCAL
   Context *{kuc01.kuniv.edu.kw/nntp}[] type: REMOTE BBOARD OLDTECH

   ***** context SYS[]
   LABEL: SYS[]
   1) NEWMAIL

   ***** context *{kuc01.kuniv.edu.kw/nntp}[]
   LABEL: News on kuc01.kuniv.edu.kw

   Where can I find the details on the format of these context & LABEL
   information?

   What do type: BBOARD OLDTECH mean in case of

   Context *{kuc01.kuniv.edu.kw/nntp}[]

I am really very sorry for such a long post but I am looking forward to get
solutions for my problems from you experienced PINE users on net.

You can reply me on my E-mail address also: rakesh@kuc01.kuniv.edu.kw

Thanks a lot in advance.

Sounds like you have a terminal emulation problem.  Most of these unix
boxes support vt100 or vt220 terminal emulation which PineMail does not
have a problem with.  You would probably set Procomm to use vt100 or
vt220.  The host machine should prompt Lisa for a terminal type when she
logs on.  Hope this helps.

Subject: Folder locking and various mail folder readers
Date: 14 Apr 1995 17:16:00 GMT
Message-Id: <3mmakg$a0r@news1.halcyon.com>

I'm updating the Filtering Mail FAQ and I'd like to include a section
on folder locking.  I've included this pointer to the Pine FAQ
on locking, which has generally useful information:

  http://www.cac.washington.edu:1180/pine/faq/errors.html#locking


I'd also like to include information about lock files uses by various
mailers (and newsreaders that can read mail folders).  This
information is useful because some mail processors, like procmail,
allow you to specify the lock file name.  Procmail's default lock file
name is folder.lock, which I think works for most mailers but I'm not
sure.  Please send me info to help me fill in this table, and any
other info that would be useful to include in the FAQ.

  Mailer or Newsreader   Lock File Name
  ====================   ==============
  elm                    ???
  emacs mail mode        ???
  mail                   ???
  mh                     ???
  mush                   ???
  nn                     <none>
  pine                   folder.lock

Thanks much,
Nancy

The web page is a bit out of date... 3.91 does not have any pgp support, 
but 3.92 will have hooks to enable pgp use.  (Sorry, no date for 3.92 yet)

I've tried to get pine to show the listserv name as well, but no luck.  I 
did, however, start using Filter, following the instructions in the 
excellent faq that is out there, and now all of my listservs get sorted 
into folders. It's great.  And I have no technical skills, and it still 
worked.

Message-Id: <ellis.797913011@gmi.edu>

I am helping someone setup a menued system on a Solaris 2.3 machine, using
rsh to keep the users from getting too carried away.  We have all sorts of
things working, but have hit the wall with spellchecking in pine and pico. 
Even though I recompiled pico with the SPELLER variable set to spell rather
than /usr/bin/spell, when P_open() calls sysstem() the path is being
prepended, and /usr/local/rbin/rsh pukes because of the /'s.  Before I
reimplement some of this to avoid having path prepended, has anyone done
something similar?  Or got any better ideas?

Thank you.

If you build pine with the mbox driver, then all user mail is immediately
copied to ~/mbox upon invocation.  Pine was built on my system with:
   ./build sgi EXTRADRIVERS=mbox

Now mail accumulates in the user's home directory rather than the mail
spool...unless they use Eudora which allows users to keep mail in the
spool.

Yes, there is a way.  First you go to configure and enable the aggregate 
command option. Then you use the following commands:

Select  ';'  (the semi-colon is the select command)
 Text
 All text
 key in ashland.edu
Apply  'a' (means the following command applies to all selected mail)
Save
 key in name of the ashland box
Apply  'a'
Delete

I have a PC and a communications package that allows disk capture.  
Instead of saving to another box, I use the export command after the 
apply.  This exports selected mail to a file in my directory. Then I exit 
Pine and enter the shell. I turn on my capture buffer and use the Unix 
cat command to transfer all mail to there.  I then read the mail after 
signing off.

On some services (sans Pine) the email reader lists received listserv
mail via listserv name and subject whereas Pine lists mail by
individual's name and subject.  'Just wondering if anyone's reading
listservs through Pine and perchance has figured a way to list them via
listserv.  

I liked seeing pending listserv mail listed by the listserv, it was
much easier to discern and/or sort.  E.g.,

 Apr 10    xyz-l                   moving along
 Apr 11    abc-l                   back to the future

and so on, versus Pine:

 Apr 10   Tom Sawyer               moving along
 Apr 11   Peggy Smith              back to the future

&c.  Anyway, no biggie, just curious if anyone's approached this.  When
subscribed to a few or more listservs, especially busy ones, I found it
faster going to see the source of the mail, i.e., the listserv, listed
rather than the person's name.

    I'm sorry if I didn't make that clear, but the mail which started 
this thread was composed by Pine (thus the full address) but delivered 
locally.  (I was reading it remotely).  However, since delivery was 
local, zmailer took the full address which Pine created and rewrote it to 
resemble mail that had been composed by a different MUA which does not 
bother to complete local addresses.  Apologies for the misunderstanding.
Zmailer works fine when presented with addresses that have arrived over 
the network.  Its aggressive rewriting of a local address started this.

    Okay, the server has given out an address and enough additional 
information for the IMAP client to compose a proper reply, so long as the 
message is being read from the server and the additional information 
provided by this IMAP server (in the form of hostname) is available.

    But as soon as I make a copy of that message from the remote IMAP 
server, via my local IMAP client, to a local filesystem, or presumably, 
to a different remote IMAP server, the additional hostname information as 
provided by the IMAP server from which the message was read, which is 
needed to properly complete a reply to the message, is lost, or replaced 
with the different remote IMAP server's hostname when I read the 
transferred copy of the original message.

    If the client receives data for which the additional hostname is 
required for generating correct replies, and the client is asked to store 
the message elsewhere, should the client then decide to attempt to preserve 
this hostname information by rewriting the headers, which are going to be 
meaningless anyway when the context of the IMAP server from which they 
were retrieved is lost?  (Or doesn't this make sense yet?)  It's not an 
ideal situation, but perhaps it would help to make a bad situation (non-
822 addresses) better (non-822 addresses qualified with the hostname 
from which they were read)...

    Having not personally had experience with out-of-the-box 
configurations for sendmail or any of its popular replacements, I can 
only guess that the average sysadmin would not bother to do this if it is 
not the default, and I surmise it is not the default for the majority of 
configurations of different versions (BSD v8, IDA, Smail, zmailer, and 
any others I've left out).  Thus, I'm introducing this to 
comp.mail.sendmail, knowing that v8.7 is under construction, so that 
perhaps Eric Allman might consider supplying this in the default 
configuration for the new release.  I believe the reason that JustSend8 
mail works successfully in so many cases is due to the supplied default 
of stripping mail to 7 bits set to False, and most sysadmins would not 
bother to change this, and similarly wouldn't make the effort to 
unqualify addresses for local delivery either, being more interested in 
simply plugging in the local information and trying to run with that.

    If I were really gung-ho about this, I'd bring it up back in the 
original zmailer discussion group, as well as introduce it in 
comp.mail.smail, but one step at a time for now...

I used pico to compose and edit my own web page. It is easy. Just type "

Message-Id: <jwsnyder.797965981@email.unc.edu>

Sorry if this is an FAQ, but none of the FAQ's I have read have been able 
to help.  Last night I installed the "N" slackware diskset for Linux, and 
I have been trying to get the mail system up and running.  Here's the 
problem: PINE refuses to send mail, even to the localhost.  However, the 
standard mail program works fine.  I'm not sure if this is the problem, 
but PINE may not be calling "sendmail".

I have installed sendmail.cf in /etc.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Will Snyder

Date: 15 Apr 1995 13:37:21 -0500
Message-Id: <3mp3p1$91k@Mercury.mcs.com>

Everytime a user starts Pine 3.91 (SCO Unix) it asks: Move current
"sent-mail" to "sent-mail-mar-1995"?. Actually not everytime, the
next time it asks: To save disk space, delete old SENT mail folder
"sent-mail-mar-1995"?

Answering yes each time. Is this normal behavior? Or can anyone suggest
what to do to stop this? There is a /usr/local/lib/pine.conf.fixed file.

Also I get messages stating my options conflict with system defaults.
How do I stop this?

Yup, another one of those. I'm trying to manage a project I very foolishly
volunteered to set up. To wit, sending out regular announcements to a very
large list of people. I have a straightforward ASCII text list of the
addresses in the appropriate addressbook (user@foo.com,luser@bar.edu)
formatting. And, yes, I know how to use the bcc: header :)  Two questions:

1) What's the best way to get this list--currently parked on my
Mac--incorporated into the addressbook? Two possibiities come to mind:
opening .addressbook with pico and pasting the entire list in; or trashing
.addressbook, adding the appropriate alias [tab] full-name [tab] list
(addresses) header, and uploading it into the right directory. In both
cases I'd need to trash and recreate the lookup file, I presume. While I'm
on the subject, how do I get pico to justify it appropriately, so that
pine doesn't screw up linebreaks either?

2) Is there a maximum number of addresses in a distribution list? Neither
the FAQ nor the tech notes seem to indicate this.

I'm using pine 3.91 on a Sun over a telnet connection.

TIA,

Rob

To check a PGP signature you just need to "pipe" your message to the
pgp command.

I use vi as my alt-editor and have the following in my .exrc file to
assist me in email composition.

	^[ = A quoted <ESC> character
	^M = A quoted RETURN character.  
	Both of these can be inserted in vi using a ^v (control V)

" Format paragraph to 75 columns
map ^[p !}fmt -c -75^M
"
" Spell check file (NOTE: saves current edit session)
map ^[s :w!^M:!ispell %^M:e!^M^M
"
" PGP sign the message (NOTE: saves current edit session)
map ^[S :w!^M:!pgpsign %^M:e!^M^M

I have not done it yet, but a PGP encrypt script would not be hard to
write.  The only problem is the user name would have to be entered by
hand.

The short pgpsign script is attached.  I know this is a hack but it will
work until 3.92.

Please don't ask me pgp questions check ftp://rtfm.mit.edu for FAQ
information.  While some of you "newbies" are at it read the pine FAQ.

I do occasionally get a hung system, when press the c (compose) key.
Sometimes the compose screen shows up, and sometimes it does not.
I then have to kill the pine program. Any ideas?

I am using pine 3.90 on a IBM RS6000, if that is of interest.

I consulted faq <www.cac.washington.edu> re. ispell and conclude that our 
copies of PINE and PICO 2.3 do not include the ispell facility which 
allows for a personalized spelling dictionary [<which ispell> in UNIX finds 
nothing].  

The faq do not suggest ispell is an add-on.  Do we have an out-dated  
version of PICO?

Thanks.

 Using Pine, is there any way of auto-bouncing all messages from a
particular user back to them?

I did the bcc: thing and put in a to: line.  My list is under 50
names, so I don't think any buffer is overflowing.  I did a test and
everybody got it OK without the other addresses being visible
EXCEPT a prodigy user.  What is different with prodigy?

    Save your effort.  There is a mkpgp script which enables Pine and PGP 
to interoperate fairly seamlessly, using this script as the alternate 
editor and still giving access to the real alternate editor.  It seems to 
work well for most reasonably well-behaved e-mail addresses and OSes and 
correspondents, and it took only a bit of minor hacking to get it to work 
with one particular user.  It should automagically be able to figure out 
the user name.

All I needed to do was format the list of addresses so each address was

paste the list with the "add to list" command prompt up. Pine interprets
each carriage return as an <enter>. A piece of cake.

Natch, it took me a couple of days of looking at ridiculously complicated
workarounds before realizing I could do this perfectly obvious trick :)
Hopefully I have spared others from similar frustration.

You either did not read the message contained below or you did not
understand all the issues.  spell has been put in /usr/local/rbin, pico and
pine are in rbin, the spell script has been changed to get rid of references
to other directories, sed, deroff, etc.  have all been put in the rbin dir.
The rsh users have PATH=/usr/local/rbin exported in their environment so
that they can find all the apps they are allowed to run.  /usr/lib/rsh also
has been copied to /usr/local/rbin.  The problem is that pine uses a
system() call which prepends path to a command that is specified without
one, and rsh rightly refuses to execute any command with /'s in it.

What I am really looking for is someone who has rewritten the P_open()
function in pico.

Then Pine is in need of a fix.  Pine shouldn't "support" any
individual or specific set of terminals, it should look in the
terminfo or termcap definition for whatever terminal it's being run on
and use the key definitions provided therein (and provide optional
builtin keys any terminal can do like emacs or vi-equivalents).

I set up procmail to filter my mail into in-coming folders.  The log 
indicates that mail is being put into these folders and I can save 
messages to them, but when I try to tab to them, pine says it can't open 
them because "no such folder".  I can read the messages with a cat, more, 
or from within an editor, but for some reason, Pine can't access these 
folders.  All the folders have been created and are in my .pinerc file.

If someone can help, I will send you the pertinent files.

Frustrated, but continuing

Hi--

Has anybody been able to get pine to work with HTML attachments? It
appears to be brain dead with regard to the text mime-type, ignoring
any entries in mailcap files and displaying them internally. At a
glance, it looked like mime_can_display() only checks the charset
parameter, totally ignoring the subtype (when the type is text).

Outgoing attachments are marked as text/plain. This would involve a
bit more work to fix, as it would require analysis of the text body
(as opposed to simply looking for a magic number). An easier, but
less robust solution would be to mark it as text/html if the file 
extension is '.html' or '.htm'.

I might try to implement at least the viewing capability, but I 
figured I should check here first to see if anybody else has tried
it or is working on it.

Thanks,
jonathan

These problems will be fixed in Pine 3.92, scheduled to be released when

Could anyone tell me how to make pine longer in row?  Right now it's 
approx 19.  Can it be lengthened to fit one's screen?  

Thanks ahead of time. . .

Any help with this would be appreciated....

I'm writing a _very_ _simple_ program to send mail using an ANSI (not 
SLIP) modem connection.  So far, I've been able to send messages by 
poking keystrokes into PINE.

The obvious problem is that if the site I'm dialing into doesn't have 
Pine -- let alone the same setup as I'm expecting -- I can't send a 
message to that site.

While the project will support SLIP connections later -- and 
hopefully MIME as well -- I don't have the resources to handle this in 
the short run.

Yet, I still need to be able to send mail through most dial-up Internet 
servers.

Q. What mail packages or APIs should I target (under ANSI/TTY/VT100 
   consoles) to increase my chance of sucessfully sending a message 
   using any given site's software?

Hi All--
  I would like to know about having a Return Receipt Generated when the 
person reads the message so that I will know if they had or not. 
Sometimes I don't get replys from people for a really long time and I am 
curious if there was a way to get a Return Receipt once someone reads the 
message.

Subject: 0.0 Preliminaries

Q: How can I have my incoming mailing-list messages automatically put
   into appropriate folders?

This is one of the most frequently asked questions about email.  This
FAQ provides basic instructions for Unix users to set up either
procmail, mailagent, or elm's filter to filter incoming mailing-list
messages.  If you have a choice, I recommend procmail which is
powerful, robust, and is actively developed and supported.

All these mail processors can also be set up to filter other types of
incoming messages, send automated replies, etc.  For instructions see
the relevant references listed below.

Subject: 1.0 Mail Folder Strategies

It is a good idea to come up with a system for naming and reading
your mail folders.  With a good system, you will have an easier time
managing the hundreds (or thousands!) of messages you will receive.

------------------------------

Date: 18 Apr 1995 00:01:10 GMT
From: FAQ Editor <faq-editor@ii.com>
Subject:     1.1 Naming Incoming Mail Folders

For my incoming mail folders I use names that start with `IN'.  For
example, I put mail sent to the procmail mailing list into a folder
named IN.procmail.  This way when all my folders are listed
alphabetically the incoming folders are together and near the top.
They are near the top because Unix is case sensitive and upper case
letters come before lower case letters in an ascii sort.

Of course, you can use any names you like for your mail folders!

------------------------------

Date: 18 Apr 1995 00:01:20 GMT
From: FAQ Editor <faq-editor@ii.com>
Subject:     1.2 Reading Incoming Mail Folders

Here are some instructions for opening a mail folder that's in the
default folder directory for some mailers and newsreaders.

         Default Folder  
 Reader   Directory      Command line command  From within reader
 ======  ==============  ====================  ==================
 elm     ~/Mail          elm -f =folder        c =folder
 pine    ~/mail          pine -if folder       G folder
 mail    ~/mail          mail -f /path/folder
 nn      ~/News          nn +folder            G +folder
 
(Please send me information for other mailers and newsreaders.)

Pine has an incoming-folder variable which you can use to list your
incoming folders in a separate section of your folder list (to view
your folder list in Pine, type `L').  Setting this variable also
allows you to use the Tab key to step through all new messages in all
your incoming folders.  For more information see the question "How
can I filter messages into different incoming folders?" in the Pine
FAQ:

  http://www.washington.edu/pine/faq/usage.html#filter


IMPORTANT NOTE 
============== 
If you are going to be editing your incoming mail folder, e.g.,
deleting messages, then your filtering program and your folder reader
should use locking schemes that work together.  Otherwise, if mail is
delivered at the same time that you are deleting a message your
folder may be corrupted.  To learn more about locking see the
question "What is folder locking and how does it work?" in the Pine
FAQ.  This is useful to read even if you don't use Pine as your
mailer.

  http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine/faq/errors.html#locking

Most mailers, such as pine and elm, use lock a file named
`folder.lock' to lock the folder named `folder'.  Note that nn does
not lock folders so you probably don't want to use nn to delete
messages in a folder that is receiving incoming messages.  (Please
send me info about locking in other mailers and newsreaders.)

For more information about specific mailers and newsreaders, see the
relevant documentation, such as man pages and Web pages.  Some
pointers to documentation are listed in section 5.0.

From: FAQ Editor <faq-editor@ii.com>
Subject: 2.0 Procmail

Procmail is a powerful mail processor that can be used to process your
mail messages either as they arrive or after they are in a mail folder.  
To find out how to process an existing mail folder see the NOTES section
of the procmail(1) man page.

Date: 18 Apr 1995 00:02:10 GMT

Subject:     2.1 Setting Up Procmail

To set up and test procmail, follow the ten steps given in sections
2.1.1 through 2.1.4 below.

------------------------------

Date: 18 Apr 1995 00:02:11 GMT
From: FAQ Editor <faq-editor@ii.com>
Subject:         2.1.1 Is Procmail on Your System?

1]  To find out if procmail is on your system and what the full path to 
    it is, type one of the following commands:

      Shell      Command
      =====      =======
      csh        which procmail
      sh or ksh  type procmail
      various    whereis procmail
      various    where procmail

    Make a note of the full path to procmail because this is needed in
    step 5b below.  You can find out the version by typing:

      procmail -v

   The latest released version, as of 15 April 1995, is 3.10.
   Version 3.11 should be out soon.  If your system doesn't have
   procmail or doesn't have the latest version, you may want to ask
   your system administrator to install it.  The procmail package of
   tools is at:

 ftp://ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/pub/packages/procmail/procmail.tar.gz

   If your sys admin isn't able to do this, use a different mail
   processor like mailagent (described in section 3 of this FAQ) or
   filter (described in section 4).

Subject:         2.1.2 Setting Up Procmail for Testing

2a] Create ~/.procmailrc.  

     cd
     pico .procmailrc

    NOTE: Throughout this article I use pico for editing files.
          Replace `pico' with your editor.

2b] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.procmailrc.
    Note that lines that begin with # are comments and are ignored by
    procmail.

     #Set on when debugging
     VERBOSE=off
 
     #Replace `mail' with your mail directory (Pine uses mail, Elm uses Mail)
     MAILDIR=$HOME/mail
     
     #Directory for storing procmail log and rc files
     PMDIR=$HOME/.procmail
     
     LOGFILE=$PMDIR/log
     INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/rc.testing
     INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/rc.maillists

3] Create the directory where you will store your procmail log and rc files 
   (this is $PMDIR that you set above).

     cd
     mkdir .procmail


4a] Create an rc (run commands) file for testing:

     cd .procmail
     pico rc.testing


4b] Enter the following in ~/.procmail/rc.testing:

      :0:
      * ^Subject:.*test
      IN.testing

    Note that the first line contains a zero (0), not the letter "oh".
    For now, don't worry about the meaning of this recipe.  It is
    explained in 2.3 "Explanation of Test Recipe."


5a] Create a ~/.forward file by typing the following. (Pico's -w flag tells 
    pico not to auto wrap lines.)

     cd
     pico -w .forward



5b] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.forward:


     "|IFS=' ' && exec /usr/local/bin/procmail -f- || exit 75 #nancym"


    == IMPORTANT NOTES ==
    * Make sure you include all the quotes, both double (") and single (').
    * The vertical bar (|) is a pipe.
    * Replace /usr/local/bin with the correct path for procmail (see step 1).
    * Replace `nancym' with your userid.  You need to put your userid in 
      your .forward so that it will be different than any other .forward file 
      on your system.
   
    * Do NOT use ~ or environment variables, like $HOME, in your .forward
      file.  If procmail resides below your home directory write out the 
      *full* path.


5c] On many systems you need to make your .forward world 
    readable and your home directory world searchable in order for the
    mail transport agent to "see" it.  To do this type:
   
      cd
      chmod 644 .forward
      chmod a+x .

Subject:         2.1.3 Testing

6] Send yourself two test messages: one with `test' in the subject
   and one without `test' in the subject.


7] Start your mailer (pine, elm, etc.) and check that the messages
   were delivered correctly.  The one with `test' in the subject
   should be in the folder $MAILDIR/IN.testing and the one without 
   `test' in the subject should be in your inbox.  

   If these were not delivered correctly, see section 2.2 on
   "Troubleshooting Procmail" section below.

Subject:         2.1.4 Setting Up Procmail to Filter Mailing List Messages

8a] Once you have successfully tested procmail in steps 6 and 7, create 
     rc.maillists for filtering incoming mailing-list messages into mail 
     folders.
  
      cd
      cd .procmail
      pico rc.maillists


8b] In rc.maillists, create a recipe, like the two example recipes
    below, for each of your mailing lists.

     :0:
     * ^TOwww-talk
     IN.www-talk

     :0:
     * ^TOprocmail
     IN.procmail
     
     The first recipe filters the www-talk mailing list and the second 
     recipe filters the procmail mailing lists.  The meaning of the first 
     recipe is as follows:

     Notation      Meaning
     ========      =======
     :0            Begin a recipe
       :           Use a lock file
     *             Begin a condition 
       ^TO         Match ``To:'' ``Cc:'' or other synonyms for To at the
                   beginning of a line, followed by any or no characters,
                   followed by....
          www-talk  ``www-talk''
     IN.www-talk   If successful match, put in folder $MAILDIR/IN.www-talk

  
     IMPORTANT NOTES
     ===============
     * ^TO is not a normal regular expression; it is a special
       procmail expression that is designed to catch any destination
       specification.  For details, see the MISCELLANEOUS section of
       the procmailrc(5) man pages.

     * Do not put a space between the caret (^) and the word `TO' in
       `^TO'.

     * Do not put a space between the `^TO' and the text that you are
       matching on; it must be `^TOtext'.

     * Both letters in `TO' must be capitalized.
       

9]  Repeat steps 6 and 7 to make sure that things are still working.


10]  Comment out the rc.testing line in you .procmailrc file so that it looks 
     like this:
          
       VERBOSE=off
       MAILDIR=$HOME/mail
       PMDIR=$HOME/.procmail
       LOGFILE=$PMDIR/log
       # INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/rc.testing
       INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/rc.maillists

     NOTE: Leaving the rc.testing line in your .procmailrc file is
           useful for future testing.

Subject:     2.2 Troubleshooting Procmail

If messages are not delivered correctly, here are steps you can use to
try to solve the problem.

------------------------------

Date: 18 Apr 1995 00:02:21 GMT
From: FAQ Editor <faq-editor@ii.com>
Subject:         2.2.1 General Strategies

1]    Look at your $LOGFILE (~/.procmail/log) to see if you can
      determine what the problem is.

2]    Check these three files for typos:
        ~/.forward
        ~/.procmailrc
        ~/.procmail/rc.testing

3]    Check the file and directory permissions of your .forward (set in 
      5c in "Setting up Procmail for Testing" above).

      Type...          In order to...
      -------          --------------
      cd               Go to your home directory.
      
      ls -l .forward   Check the permission: it should say -rw-r--r--
      
      ls -ld .         Check permission of home dir: it should say drwx?-x?-x
                       The ?'s may be r's or hyphens or one of each (i.e.,
                       drwx--x--x, drwxr-xr-x, drwxr-x--x, drwx--xr-x are
                       each acceptable.)
      

4]    If the above three steps do not locate the problem edit your 
      ~/.procmailrc so that it contains:

        VERBOSE=on

      Test procmail by following steps 6 and 7 again.  Look at your
      $LOGFILE (which will contain verbose messages) to see if you
      can now determine what the problem is.

      If you are still having problems see the next section on
      "Alternate .forward Files."  After you get procmail to work, 
      you probably will want to set VERBOSE back to off.

From: "Stephen R. van den Berg" <berg@pool.informatik.rwth-aachen.de>
Subject:         2.2.2 Alternate .forward files

If the .forward template in 5b above doesn't work the following alternatives 
might be helpful:

In a perfect world:
	"|exec /usr/local/bin/procmail #nancym"
In an almost perfect world:
	"|exec /usr/local/bin/procmail USER=nancym"
In another world:
	"|IFS=' ';exec /usr/local/bin/procmail #nancym"
In a different world:
	"|IFS=' ';exec /usr/local/bin/procmail USER=nancym"
In a smrsh world:
	"|/usr/local/bin/procmail #nancym"

These formats can be tried in different combinations, the leading "| can
be tried as |" instead, or vice versa.

NOTE
====
If your system uses procmail as its local delivery agent, you do not
need a .forward file; simply having a .procmailrc files suffices.  To
find out if procmail is the local delivery agent, ask your system
administrator.

Subject:     2.4 Tracking Your Incoming Mail

You can use mailstat, a useful script that is part of the procmail
package, to check your procmail log file. Check to see if it is 
on your system by typing either `which mailstat' or `type mailstat'.  
If it's on your system type:

  mailstat $HOME/.procmail/log

This displays a concise version of your log file and moves your log 
file to log.old.  You may want to put the above line in your .login so that 
each time you log in you will see a listing of how many messages you've
received since the last time you ran mailstat, and what folders these
messages were delivered to.

You can get a mailstat listing of log.old by using the -o flag:

  mailstat -o $HOME/.procmail/log


If mailstat is not on your system ask your system administrator to
install it.  The script is located with all the other procmail tools
(see 2.1.1 above for the ftp location).

Subject: 3.0 Mailagent

Mailagent is a powerful mail processing package that can be used to
process your mail messages, either at arrival time via a .forward hook
or later on while they are already saved in a mail folder.

Mailagent is written in Perl and hence has all the advantages of being
interpreted, i.e. it is easy to enhance dynamically and to customize.

This version of the FAQ describes the basics of setting up mailagent to
process incoming mail messages from within a .forward. To find out about
the more advanced features of mailagent, please refer to the mailagent(1)
manual page.

Date: 18 Apr 1995 00:03:10 GMT
From: Raphael Manfredi <ram@hptnos02.grenoble.hp.com>
Subject:     3.1 Setting Up Mailagent

1] First, make sure mailagent is available on your system. The easiest
   way to do this is to run:

    mailagent -V

   which will print the mailagent version if it is available, or the shell
   will issue an error message "mailagent: not found" or something like it.

2a] Now you need to understand the MTA (Mail Transport Agent, the program
    that delivers the mail; usually, sendmail) will NOT deliver to mailagent
    directly, rather to an intermediate (small) filter program. Two versions
    are available: shell or C -- refer to the mailagent(1) manpage to choose,
    but I recommend you use the C version first, and move to the shell
    version if you can't run a binary from your .forward file.

2b] Locate the filter program (it will be filter or filter.sh depending on
    whether you choose the C or the shell version respectively) under some
    directory like /usr/local/lib/mailagent. From now on, we'll assume we
    use the C filter and that it is located under /usr/local/lib/mailagent.

3] Copy the file /usr/local/lib/mailagent/mailagent.cf as ~/.mailagent and
   edit it to configure your system correctly. You will see two distinct
   sections in that file and you need to set-up properly the first one, the
   "Configuration section".

   If you have a version of mailagent that is recent enough (at least 3.0 PL32)
   then you can create an initial configuration very easily and quickly by
   running the following command:

    mailagent -I

   which will set-up an almost ready-to-use ~/.mailagent file. All you
   need to do at this point is go through its configuration section
   to make sure mailagent made the right choices...

   The minimal set of variables that MUST be correctly set (i.e. for which
   you cannot rely on the default set in the file) are (# introduces comment
   in a shell-like manner, which run up to the end of the line):

    home:  # Your HOME directory, as reported by "echo $HOME", usually.
    path:  # Path to be used to locate mailagent and perl, at least.
    p_xxx: # Path to be appended to "path" above when running on machine "xxx".
    user:  # Your login name.
    name:  # Your name.
    level: # Logging level. I recommend you raise it to 20 for testing.

   The mail folder directory is ~/Mail by default, but it can be changed
   only from within your rule file by putting

    maildir = ~/mail;

   at its top, for instance, to make it ~/mail. The rule file is defined as
   the "rules" parameter, and is set to ~/.rules by default.

4] Ensure the directories configured in your ~/.mailagent under "logdir" and
   "spool" and "queue" do exist. If you use the standard setting, this
   requires the following commands:

    cd
    mkdir var
    cd var
    mkdir log mailagent
    cd mailagent
    mkdir queue

5a] Create a rule file (named ~/.rules by default) for testing:

    cd
    vi .rules

5b] Enter the following in ~/.rules

    Subject: /test/     { SAVE testing };

    The meaning of that rule should be pretty obvious: If we receive a mail
    whose subject line contains the word "test", then we save that mail in
    a folder named "testing", under the default folder directory (~/Mail).

5c] Create a ~/.forward file as follows:

    "|exec /usr/local/lib/mailagent/filter >> /export/home/ram/.bak 2>&1"

    The meaning of that line is the following: every mail should be piped
    (hence the leading "|" character) onto the filter program, and any
    output from that program (i.e. errors) are appended to some file in
    your home directory, with stderr following stdout (2>&1) in traditional
    sh syntax.

    == IMPORTANT NOTES ==
    * Your .forward is always processed by sh, regardless of your login shell.
    * Replace /export/home/ram with your proper login directory full path.
      That's a part that makes your .forward unique (for zealous optimizing
      sendmail that are dead wrong about optimizing!) and that can save
      you a lot of trouble if anything goes wrong! Just look at your ~/.bak!
    * Replace /usr/local/lib/mailagent/filter with the proper filter path
      on your machine.

5d] Note that on many systems, you need to ensure your .forward will be
    readable by everybody, and that your home directory has the "x" bit set
    for everybody (i.e. can be part of a lookup path) so that sendmail can see
    and parse your .forward file. To ensure this, type:

        cd
        chmod a+r .forward
        chmod a+x .

6] Send yourself two test messages: one with "test" in the subject, and one
   without "test" in the subject.

7a] Checkout your ~/.bak file: it should be empty!

7b] Checkout your ~/var/log/agentlog file to see what really happened to your
    messages. Watch out for any ERROR or WARNING logs. This assumes you have
    left at least the default logging level (9) in the ~/.mailagent file (the
    "level" variable). But for testing, that level should be raised to 20 to
    help you diagnose what's going on.

7c] Look out in ~/Mail/testing. You should find there the message whose Subject
    line contained the word "test". Then make sure the other message has been
    delivered to your regular mailbox. (Since no match occurred in your rule
    file, the mail is left in your mailbox by default).

7d] TROUBLESHOOTING
    * If your mail was not properly delivered, please make sure your rule file
      and configuration file are correct by issuing the following command:

        mailagent -d

    * If the previous command does not output the single rule you should have
      put in ~/.rules, then please make sure step 3 and 4 above were correctly
      performed (those being the crucial steps ensuring a proper configuration).
    
    * Check the ~/.bak file for error messages.

    * Check for typos in any of these files:
        ~/.forward
        ~/.mailagent
        ~/.rules
    
    * Check the file and directory permissions of your .forward (set in step
      5c above).

      Type...          In order to...
      -------          --------------
      cd               Go to your home directory.
      
      ls -l .forward   Check the permission: it should say -rw-r--r--
      
      ls -ld .         Check permission of home dir: it should say drwx?-x?-x
                       The ?'s may be r's or hyphens or one of each (i.e.,
                       drwx--x--x, drwxr-xr-x, drwxr-x--x, drwx--xr-x).
      
    * If none of the previous hints helped you identify problem, and you can't
      figure it out from the output in ~/.bak or in the ~/var/log/agentlog file
      (or whatever file you have configured for logging within your ~/.mailagent
      file, variables "log" and "logdir"), then make sure your mail is not
      waiting in the MTA's queue: this might be the case if the agentlog file
      is empty. If you are using sendmail as MTA, you can run:

        /usr/lib/sendmail -bp
    
      to print out the queue.
    
    * As a last resort, please look at the mailagent(1) manual page under
      the section "Testing Your Installation" for more tips and things
      to look at.

8] Once you have successfully tested mailagent in steps 6 and 7 above,
   you're on! Mailagent is ready to process your mail. All you have to
   do is extend the ~/.rules file to add more rules.

   For instance:

   To Cc: www-talk      { SAVE www-talk };
   To Cc: agent-users   { SAVE agent-users };

   Those two rules filter the two mailing lists www-talk and agent-users into
   their respective folders, whether the mailing list address appear in the To
   OR Cc header.

   Since rules are not qualified as a pattern match (contrary to our test
   above), they match on logins in the address, i.e. they will match things
   like www-talk@chip.com or chip!www-talk, or a plain simple www-talk if
   this is a local alias. (This implicit matching on logins works only for
   some selectors like To, Cc or From which are know to contain addresses).

   If you wish to sort on patterns appearing in the Subject of messages for
   instance, then you must use a pattern matching syntax, as in:

   Subject: /star trek/ { SAVE star-trek; };

   to save in a folder "star-trek" all the messages whose subject contains
   the words "star trek". Case matters, but keep on reading...

9] As an advanced topic, since mailagent is written in Perl, you have all the
   power of Perl's regular expressions at your disposal. Which means you can
   write things like this:

   To Cc: agent-users                    { REJECT AGENT };
   <AGENT> Subject: /^\w*subscribe/i     { DELETE };
   <AGENT> *                             { UNIQUE -a; SAVE agent };

   The second lines makes use of that perl extended regular expression syntax:
   \w matches an alphanumeric character plus "_", while the trailing "i" option
   requests a case-insensitive match.

   You also note you have a real automaton at your disposal. You can enter
   a special state (AGENT in our example) and continue parsing by only
   scanning for rules tagged by this mode. The first match stops the automaton,
   unless you REJECT to continue processing. When not restricted by a mode list,
   a rule is always taken into account. For example, assuming the automaton
   is in the state "NEWS", it will not consider rules tagged <AGENT>, as in
   the above example. The automaton begins in mode "INITIAL".

   The "UNIQUE -a" action followed by a SAVE ensures only one copy per
   Message-ID will ever end-up in your agent folder -- no duplicates!
   Also note you can have more than one action per rule, and that the last
   one uses '*' to match anything, i.e. its action part between {} will
   always be executed in AGENT mode, when reached by the automaton.

   Also, since in Perl regular expression syntax, \b matches a word-boundary
   and \s any space or tab character, we can write our Star Trek message
   sorting into a much more robust form:

   Subject: /\bstar\s+trek\b/i  { SAVE star-trek; };

   (\s+ matches one or more white spaces, while \s* would match zero or more,
   see the Perl manual page for a complete description of regular expressions.)

   which will match on various subject strings like "Last Star Trek season"
   or "I am addicted to Star trek", but not on "Tristar treks" -- whatever
   that means :-)

   All in all, the filtering automaton syntax is pretty much intuitive and
   easy to read. You have to learn which actions are possible and what they
   mean, naturally.

From: Raphael Manfredi <ram@hptnos02.grenoble.hp.com>
Subject:     3.2 Tracking Your Incoming Mail

If you are curious about what mailagent does to your mail, you have two
options:

    * Look at your "agentlog" file, with a log level set to 9.
    * Get a summary of all the actions performed by running:

        mailagent -summary

      This last option is only possible if you have initialized the statistics
      gathering process by creating a ~/var/mailagent/mailagent.st file (under
      the default setting from ~/.mailagent).

      You will get a clear picture of your processing, by seeing which rule
      match, how often, in which state, etc... You will also know how many
      times you SAVE or DELETE messages for instance.

      Actually, mailagent statistics are triggered by a simple

        mailagent -s
    
      command, the letters given after in the {u,m,a,r,y} set being options
      that alter the output given by the command.

    * Look at the ~/.bak occasionally to make sure no error is pending...

From: Raphael Manfredi <ram@hptnos02.grenoble.hp.com>
Subject:     3.3 How Safe Mailagent Processing Is?

As soon as the filter program has taken a hold on your message, you can rest
assured the mail will get filtered one way or the other. If filter can't
queue your mail, it will exit with an exit status of 75, that status
being recognized by "sendmail" as a "deliver later on" hint, in which case
the mail message will safely wait in sendmail's queue.

So if filter gets your message, it immediately forks and exits with a 0
status for sendmail, letting it know its work is finished and releasing it
to save resources. It then calls mailagent on the queued message (in mailagent's
private queue) to actually process the message.

Only after successful processing will mailagent delete the queued message.
Hence, under an heavily loaded system, the worst that could happen would be
a duplicate processing of a message, or a bounce back when sendmail cannot
fork and exec the filter program from your .forward.

Under catastrophic conditions, filter or mailagent will simply dump the message
on stdout, for ~/.bak to catch, preceded by the reason why processing was
aborted.

From: Raphael Manfredi <ram@hptnos02.grenoble.hp.com>
Subject:     3.4 Locking Under Mailagent

By default, mailagent proceeds with a fixed locking scheme (.lock extension)
plus flock() if asked to do so at Configure time. However, mailagent provides
support for NFS-secure locks and also can use non-standard locking procedures,
configurable from within ~/.mailagent (variables "nfslock" and "mboxlock").

However, it cannot support locking on a rule basis (yet!). The author is
willing to raise the priority of that item if one comes up with a legitimate
need for that feature that could not be worked-around by a PERL escape. ;-)

Subject:     3.5 Folder Types Supported

Mailagent can deliver mail to plain UNIX folders (also known as "mbox format"),
to MMDF folders, to MH folders (with unseen sequence update built-in and using
locks, not like rcvstore which does not!) or to directories (ala MH, but
without unseen sequence support and with alternate naming possible).

It also supports delivery to folders with the "x" bit set, in which case
mailagent interprets those as being hooks. It either pipes the message
to the "program" or further interprets the hook to do more processing.
See the manual page mailagent(1) under the section "MAIL HOOKS" for more
details.

Subject: 4.0 Filter

Filter is part of the Elm package of tools.  Note that you can use filter
to filter your incoming mail even if you are not using Elm to read your mail.

IMPORTANT NOTE
==============
If your system has both procmail and filter installed then you should use 
procmail which is *much* more robust and powerful than filter.  This 
recommendation is almost universal; even the developers of Elm and Filter
recommend procmail over filter.  IT IS POSSIBLE TO LOSE MAIL MESSAGES
WHEN USING FILTER; this is rare but it has happened.

------------------------------

Date: 18 Apr 1995 00:04:10 GMT
From: FAQ Editor <faq-editor@ii.com>
Subject:     4.1 Setting up Filter
Followup-To: comp.mail.elm

1] Find out if filter is on your system and what the full path to it is.  
   If you are using the C shell (csh) type:

     which filter

   Or, if you are using the Korn shell (ksh) or the Bourne shell (sh) type:

     type filter

   If neither ``which'' nor ``type'' are on your system try ``where'' and
   ``whereis''.  If your system doesn't have filter ask your system 
   administrator to install it; or even better ask her to install procmail.


2] Note the full path of your home directory by typing:

     cd
     pwd


3a] Create ~/.elm/filter-rules.  (Note that throughout this article I use
    pico for editing files.  Replace ``pico'' with your editor.)

     cd
     mkdir .elm
     cd .elm
     pico filter-rules

  
3b] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.elm/filter-rules

     if (subject contains "test") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.testing"
   
   Replace /j/nancym with your home directory path (see step 2).
   Replace /Mail with the name of the directory where your mail folders are
   stored.  Pine and Berkeley Mail use /mail (lower case m) and Elm uses 
   /Mail (upper case M).
   

4] To see what the filter rule will do type the following at your Unix 
   prompt:  

     filter -r


5a] Create a ~/.forward file by typing the following. (Pico's -w flag tells 
    pico not to auto wrap lines.)

      cd
      pico -w .forward


5b] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.forward:


     "|/usr/local/bin/filter -o /j/nancym/.elm/filter-errors"


    == IMPORTANT NOTES ==
    * Make sure you include the quotes (").
    * The vertical bar (|) is a pipe.
    * Replace /usr/local/bin with the correct path for filter (see step 1).
    * Replace /j/nancym with your home directory (see step 2).
   
    * Do NOT expect environment variables, like $HOME, to work in your 
      .forward file.
    * Do NOT expect ~ to mean your home directory in the .forward file.


5c] Note that on many systems you need to make your .forward is world 
    readable and your home directory world searchable in order for the
    mail transport agent to "see" it.  To do this type:
   
      cd
      chmod 644 .forward
      chmod a+x .


6] Send yourself two test messages: one with ``test'' in the subject
   and one without ``test'' in the subject.


7a] Start your mailer (pine, elm, etc.) and check that the messages
    were delivered correctly.  The one with ``test'' in the subject
    should be in the folder IN.testing and the one without ``test'' 
    in the subject should be in your inbox.  If these were delivered 
    correctly go on to step 8.


7b] TROUBLESHOOTING
    * If the two messages were not delivered correctly look at your
      ~/.elm/filter-errors to see if you can determine what the problem 
      is.  

    * Check these two files for typos:
        ~/.forward
        ~/.elm/filter-rules

    * Check the file and directory permissions of your .forward (set in 
      5c above).

      Type...          In order to...
      -------          --------------
      cd               Go to your home directory.
      
      ls -l .forward   Check the permission: it should say -rw-r--r--
      
      ls -ld .         Check permission of home dir: it should say drwx?-x?-x
                       The ?'s may be r's or hyphens or one of each (i.e.,
                       drwx--x--x, drwxr-xr-x, drwxr-x--x, drwx--xr-x).
      

    * If none of these turn up the problem edit your ~/.forward so
      that filter will be verbose with it's output (use the -vo flag).

        "|/usr/local/bin/filter -vo /j/nancym/.elm/filter-errors"

      And repeat steps 6 and 7.  After you get filter to work you 
      will probably want to change the ``-vo'' flag back to ``-o''.

   
8]  After you have successfully tested filter in steps 6 and 7, edit
    ~/.elm/filter-rules so that it contains a modified version of the
    following:

     # if (subject contains "test") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.testing"
     if (to contains "www-talk") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.www-talk"
     if (to contains "hopos-l") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.hopos"

     Replace /j/nancym with your home directory path and
     /Mail with the name of your mail directory.  Replace the mailing 
     list string (e.g., "www-talk") and the name of the mail folder
     (e.g., IN.www-talk) with text for your mailing lists.

     Note that ``to contains...'' means either the To or Cc header contains...

     Rather than deleting the test line, it's useful to just turn it
     into a comment (by preceding it with #) so that you can easily
     use it for future testing.

Subject:     4.2 Tracking Your Incoming Mail
Followup-To: comp.mail.elm

You can get a short summary of filter's activity by typing:

    filter -s

For a longer summary type:

    filter -S

Or you can look at the log file itself, ~/.elm/filterlog.

You should regularly look at ~/.elm/filter-errors to make sure things 
are working.  You can automatically check filter-errors each time you
log in by putting the following in your .login:

    tail ~/.elm/filter-errors

Also you probably want to regularly delete filterlog and filter-errors so 
they don't fill up your disk space.  To get a summary of the filter log and 
clear it type:

    filter -cs

No, but that's how it will work in 3.92 if you're taking from a single 
message.  Thanks for the suggestion.

The format of the address book is given in the technical notes which are 
in the doc directory of the source distribution.  Your problem is 
probably caused by the fact that the fields are separated by a single TAB 
character, not by spaces.

If the address is a header of a message you're viewing you can use the 
TakeAddress command.  Go into ListMode, do the Take, and type the 
nickname of the list.  (If there is only one address in the message Pine 
tries to "optimize" the number of keystrokes you need to use and will 
skip straight to adding a new entry to the address book, which isn't what 
you want in this case.  You can work around that by first Selecting the 
message and then doing an Apply Take, which goes into ListMode.  3.92 
won't have this oddity.)  If the address you want to add is just another 
entry in the address book there is nothing you can do other than to use 
the Z command to add to the list.  You can type the nickname rather than 
the full address, though.  3.92 will have the capability of Taking an 
address from the addressbook and adding it to a list in the addressbook, 
saving you the typing.  Hope this answers your questions.

Couldn't find anywhere for pico questions and this is the closest thing 
so why not. I'm wondering if there is a is to suspend (aka ^Z) pico on 
Unix. This seems a bit pointless yes, but I was curious if it's possible. 
Anyone know?

Mike,

Pine does not have any form of Return-Receipt-To built in but if you are 
using sendmail as your MTA, then you can get receipts.  This is done by 
adding a Return-Receipt-To: customised header to your pine.conf file.

Note that you *should* not put Retun-Receipt-To: in the header section of 
sendmail.cf as this would mean that every email would get a receipt.  
Also the Return-Receipt-To: function is meant for debugging purposes only 
and is not intended as a delivery notification service.  In addtion, this 
may not always work as ir requires a flag (F=l) to be set in the 
receiving sendmail.cf file for it to work.

If you are not getting replies from people for a long time, this could be 
for a couple of reasons.

1)  The peole who you are sending email to, get so much email that it 
takes them a long time to answer (or they have other priorities, which 
means that they do not read email that often :-)

2)  The return (or sending) path of the emai means that the email itself 
is taking a long time to get to your recipients.  If your email has to go 
through 3 gateways and each takes 1/2 day to deal with it (extreme I 
agree), it would take 1 1/2 days for your email to get there !

Another thing to think about is that some people will not thank you for 
asking for delivery notification/return-receipt as there are still people 
who have to pay for email traffic

Using Pine's PICO editor as opposed to configuring for one's choice of
editor, I'm curious if there are keys for jumping to the end of the
current document or to the beginning.  I can find at best only keys
for scrolling one screen at a time, forward or backward.  Nothing about
going to the end/beginning of the document so I was wondering if that
exists.

Hello,

I was trying to post news by using pine but have no luck :<
The error message (on screen) said that I don't have the privilage to post
but when I checked back to the pine-debug? file, there is a line saying 
------------
IMAP 4:9 ....Server NNTP[auth] server version .. ..... (posting ok).
------------
I (guess) tried to enable the preference post-news-without-validation but it
doesn't seems to work either.

Except pine, I can use trn, Pnews or even "tin from a -remote- host -> I mean
not within the same department". Since the pine program was intalled by
myself and now I am running out of ideas.. Please someone please give me a
hand!!

Thanks,

I have just installed pine 3.91 on my sparc20 and have noticed
the following an unusual behavior. The key sequence is
as follows:

C  -- compose
^J -- attachments
^T -- to file
move cursor to a directory
S  -- select
^C -- cancel

At this point the command menu is not refreshed.
Is this a bug, or a problem with my compile?

Hello!

I am a novice Pine user & administrator (dangerous combination
already!), and I am attempting to set up Pine on a group of Windows NT
workstations linked to a Sun mail server.  As you see from this
message, I have succeeded in building imapd and pine (this was
composed on a Sun machine other than the mail server), however PC-pine
seems unable to recognize the mail host.  I downloaded the
pcpine_w.zip version on the assumption that NT is a Winsock setup, and
set up inbox as {itek1}INBOX (itek1 is defined as 192.92.84.103 in my
NT and Sun hosts files).  When I attempt to access my inbox from
PC-pine, I get the message [Host not found (#10093): itek1].

Also, when I run Pine on the Sun (e.g. this session), I get the
message [Error saving configuration in file "/home/wagner/.pinerc": 
Cross-device link].

I would appreciate any help you can offer on these problems.  Thanks!

Other than some quirks, it's done. Basically, it's just addressbooks and
arrow-keys in Pine. Nothing big. However, I've been delayed for personal 
reasons.

Qualcomm wanted people to write in asking for Pine? Is it going to be
shareware or something? Whenever I release mine, it'll be free and with
source, same deal as the usual Pine and PC-Pine. 

I should note that this is a port of Pine, and not PC-Pine.

I have installed pine on our system. We have disk quotas for our users, 
but it is different for undergrads and others. When they exceed their 
quota, pine exits with the error "segmentation fault". Even though the 
system warns them about exceeding their quota when they login, they 
usually ignore till they cannot get into pine. If they use the system 
for email only, they have no clue as to what is happening. 

Pine seems to recreate  the .pinerc file after each invocation after 
making a temporary backup file in the home directory. 

Is it possible to avoid the "segmentation fault" error by redirecting 
this to /tmp ?  

elm seems to work ok in such a situation.
Any help will be appeciated.

Hi,

I hope that some of you can help me.  I'm having trouble building
Pine for a Sun Sparc 20 running Solaris 2.4.

I untar the tarfile, cd into pine3.91 and type:
``build sol''

The programs:  mtest, imapd and pico seem to get built OK, but
for pine I get:

Done


Can someone tell me what's wrong and how to fix it?
I've never build pine before.

Use the Delete command (I think it's D) not the ^Kill command.  You can 
only delete messages that YOU posted, you cannot delete other's.  Kill is 
used to screen out messages that you don't care to see (or to have your 
kids see).  You can Kill posts from a specific sender (including 
yourself, as you have discovered) or you can Kill posts with a specific 
subject matter (like if you don't want your kids to see posts on a 
certain thread), etc., or maybe there's some obnoxious person in the 
group that keeps writing nonesense, etc., there are other sort options, 
but I don't remember them at the moment.

BYE again.

	* I just remembered another qualm I have with Pine 3.91 in 
reading Usenet groups:
	I configured my setup to keep all threads together but there is 
so far no option in keeping the threads also in alphabetical order.  This 
would save some time and having to hit the D key wouldn't be as much of a 
problem if the threads were sorted alphabetically.

	What is the current news about an OS/2 version of Pine?  I have 
already sent my request to Qualcomm when they solicited requestes for this.

	I have just started to read some of my Usenet news via Pine 
3.91.  It's not the best way (compared to using TIN) but it will have to 
suffice until my Freenet implements offline reading.

	I have a couple of observations/comments that I would like to make:

	* I don't like to use Pine 3.91 for Usenet if the volume of 
messages is greater than 75/day +/- a few.  What I really don't like is 
having to press the D key to delete articles I have no interest in or 
have already viewed.

	* On articles with more than 1 computer output page (25 lines) 
Pine will include the last 2 lines from the previous page as part of the 
next page.  I don't like this 'feature' either.  Is there a way of 
setting this to OFF like I can in TIN?

	Any help would be appreciated.

Are you using pine in a "dumb terminal" window (ZTerm, ProComm, CrossTalk,
etc.)? Then cut and paste with your terminal program's "edit" menu. Most
term programs are very cooperative with large volumes of data being cut
and pasted; it just gets treated as a sort of mini-upload and download, as
far as I can tell. Anyway, you should have no problem doing that.

And if you're sitting in front of the Unix box in question? I have no idea
at all of what to do. Maybe save an article as ASCII text, then cut and
uncut into the other article. I'm no expert at that, so *don't* take my
work on it. 

Cheers,

Rob

If I'm not mistaken, Pine does not really support viewing "threads"
in the technical sense, ie. via the references header.  Sorting
on the subject field would be the best you can get.  Of course, if
someone changes the subject it will appear as a new thread, even
though the references header is threaded correctly.  Conversely,
when someone posts a followup without a proper references header,
PINE will treat it as part of the same thread, as long as the subject
field is unchanged, whereas a newsreader that goes only on references
headers would treat it as a new thread.

OK that's something your server has programmed, but yes it's normal.  
What you should do is the following ... sometime around the third week of 
the month look thru your email files (both inbox and sent mail) and move 
them to another file.  Now assuming you're working in pine ... make a 
folder called 'golf-save' or 'ski-save' or 'sex-save' or whatever ... then 
move the messages to those folders.  pine doesna use the move command, 
use s for save (maybe it's ^s) whatever, then save them to the other 
folder ... hope this has confused you enough ... please feel free to 
email me if this is not clear ... which upon re-reading it I'm sure it's 
not.

Message-Id: <3n0gfp$c68@hermod.uio.no>

I have a problem with highlighting in pine
and a braille display. The display can show what
for instance Word Perfect calls "highlighted", 
"underlined" and "invers video". Pine is ascii-
based and we are having a hard time getting
the braille display to show what is highlighted 
in pine, which is not so strange as I suppose
it is only a matter of escape-sequences.

Does anybody have an idea as to how to solve 
this problem?
Are there any blind people using Pine out there?
(how exactly does pine highlight?)

Hi everybody,

Can I have a kill file for _news_?  I know I can use procmail to filter 
unwanted emails to /dev/null (I'm already doing so), but how about the 
news?  Or will this be implemented into newer pine?

Second question, I _do_ want to have sent-mail, except for mailing lists 
such as pine-info because what I've written will be sent back to me 
anyway.  No point of keeping two copies.  But when I edit my address 
book, I can't change the default sent-mail to empty.  So, how do I change 
only certain entries in address book not to have sent-mail?  Can I put 
/dev/null there? (Haven't tried this, just thought of this 2 seconds ago 
:) )

Thanks for your time.

Yes, I have a suggestion.  Use the same work-around as I use with
Yehavi's VMS port of PINE, and configure a "customized header" of
Bcc: to yourself.
 
Of course, the resulting mail will turn up in your new mail folder,
rather than in your FCC folder, but it's better than nothing.

If pine is using termcap it uses the so and se attributes from the 
termcap entry to start and end highlighting.  These are typically set to 
the ANSI escape sequences

    ESC [ 7 m      to go into highlighting mode, and
    ESC [ m        to go back out of highlighting mode.

They could be set up differently.  I also want to mention that the next 
version of Pine will have a couple minor improvements that should help 
blind users, like a show-cursor feature to get the cursor to move to a 
more interesting place.

You can set the alternate-editor variable on the command line with 
something like

	pine -alternate-editor="emacs foobar"

The same technique works for any .pinerc variable...

pico .plan

ls -al

make sure the permissions on . are drwxr-xr-x

ls -l .plan

make sure the permissions on .plan are -rw-r--r--
if not, type:   chmod og+r .plan

I'm not sure about mtest off the top of my head, but in Pine you can set
the smtp-server variable in the Setup/Config screen or
/usr/local/lib/pine.conf file to point to your remote mail hub.  The
X-Status: header is where Pine (via c-client) stores message flags, e.g. 
Deleted, Answered, ...

This is actually a failure of the sendmail program that Pine calls, not
Pine itself.  A possible work-around is to set smtp-server in the
Setup/Config screen...

It is a problem with the sendmail program on your system, not with Pine
itself.  A possible work-around is to set the smtp-server variable in the
Setup/Config screen...

Not in Pine, but you can do it with a delivery filter like procmail, 
devliver, filter, or mailagent...

Hi,
  I've played around (somewhat) with a copy of Pine.3.91. I
want to be able to change the quote character (currently >) and
the line (on day, user wrote:). I don't have the time to look
through the files, and what I have changed and then recompiled
hasn't changed the ouput.

Any help is appreciated.

Only two builds .. build bsi and build bsd .. come close to making pine on
my crypt.less FreeBSD PC (bsi)..  Missing libs are much worse with the bsd
param to build .. many type defects .. too.

Maybe someone out there can suggest a pine/makefile.xxx for 4.4/Fbsd2.0
and the osdep to join it that will work with out the US.crypt .. not ready 
to reinstall till I have mail and a network to get stuff with ..

Thanks for any files or tips .. BW /ev/

Subject: Followup to Newsgroup w/o Reading News
Date: 19 Apr 1995 17:07:10 -0400
Message-Id: <3n3u1u$b4o@telerama.lm.com>

I don't normally use pine to read news.  A while ago, I received some
email that was the result of a 'reply' action from a newsreader.  I
prepared a reply to the author of the email.  When I tried to send it
to the author, pine 3.91 asked me if I wanted to post a followup to
the newsgroup.  I replied 'yes', and my recollection is that the send
failed because I hadn't specified a NNTP server.  I discovered how to
configure a NNTP server, restarted pine, and was able to send the
message and post the follow up.  I then noticed the starting pine was
taking "forever".  Since I had specified an NNTP server, pine was
checking for new articles in all of my subscribed newsgroups.  I
commented out the specification of the NNTP serer.

I checked the pine documentation, but didn't see anything that said
"just check mail, ignore news".  I'd like to start pine in this mode
so I can leave the NNTP server configured in case I ever need to
followup as in the situation described in the first paragraph.

Thanks,
Barry

Anybody know when 3.92 is coming out?  I'm looking forward to the 
'built in' pgp interface.

My provider is completely ignorant of IMAP.  I need to present 
them with ideas for debugging my problem. 
 
I can access my INBOX without any problem.  I can't, however, 
access any of my remote mailboxes.  I can't save to them or read 
mail in them.  I get a pine message which repeats every 15 seconds. 
 
  [Waited xx seconds for server rely.  Still waiting...] 
 
After I break contact, I see that a *.lock file was created remotely. 
 
Where do I start? 
 
John.

Hi Pine Developers & users

I guess Pine first of all is a mail-program, so maybe you do not accept
the following as a bug, but if Pine should be used as a news-tool, support
for the correct news-headers should also be included. 

Our problem is that we want a 'Organization'-header in our news-postings 
with a default value (name of our University). Doing that also makes the 
'Organization'-header occur in normal mails, where the header do not belong.

I therefore suggest, that new versions of Pine will exclude headers in 
normal mails that do not belong there.

If this is already possible, I have not been able to find out how, and 
I'm sorry to have bothered you. I would however like to know if possible  
how it is done, or if pine will support this in the future.

Regards from Finn in Denmark

I recently abandoned the Columbia Mail Manager in favor of Pine.
I had originally made the opposite switch to get the benefits of
MM's bulk searching and message manipulation features; however,
Pine has surpassed MM in important respects.

One MM feature I miss is the ability to set a keyword for a message
which can then be used for instant searching and related manipulation.
I gather there is no way Pine can associate a keyword with a message.

Pine does not make as much use of extended memory as it should. As a 
result there are cases when it runs out, such as when including a 
(relatively) large PC file; 100k is probably enough. This is not very 
good; what is worse is that in some cases the ^R command merely truncates 
the read, thus constructing a bad message.

For 3.92, please improve the diagnostic; for some future improv ement 
please improve the memory handling.

Hi,

I am having a similar problem here myself. I actually traced this 
connection with some fairly terse IP trace tools and found that the PC 
does not try to authenticate under the IMAP protocol. I checked that the 
imap server  was running on the host with the mtest program and it all 
worked fine. At the moment, I can't proceed until I find why PC Pine does 
not proceed after it receives the initial IMAP greeting message from the 
server.

By copy to the pine guys:

Can you give us some hints how we can debug this problem?


regards,
Ben

It is really none of your business when and whether they read your
messages.  You only have the right (perhaps) to know that the package was
successfully delivered.

This demand, which is frequently made, is odious.

I like posting things, but because I want you to be sure and get it, I am
also mailing it.  You are a demanding person, aren't you?

Hi,

I have been using Pine for while now and I just wanted to say that I find
it to be a great, well written program for users.  The Pine development
team has made a wonderful product.   

I get a lot e-mail using the attachment feature of Pine3.91 and I have
noticed that the Attachment Index Screen doesn't use the same logic as the
Folder Index Screen when it comes to using the "jump" command. I have the
"enable-jump-shortcut" option set in Setup Configuration so that I can
select which message to "jump" to.  I use this feature when I get a lot of
e-mail (sometimes 30-40 email's per day), sometimes with two or three
attachments and I don't always have time to read everything right away. 
So I tend to jump around and read things out of order.  The Attachment
Index screen doesn't allow the input of numbers to allow jumping the same
way the Folder Index screen does.  

This would be a nice enhancement/fix in a future release (3.92?) so 
that the interface is consistant for the user. 

Keep Up The Great Work!
Thanks

Hello Pine-ers!

I posted this message a couple of weeks ago, but didn't get any 
response;I'll try again:

Is there a way to disable the KBlock feature of pine (available at the 
main menu.) 

Also, does anyone know of a way to direct the unix print command to print 
to a local printer, similar to the way pine can print to "attached-to-ansi"?

Thanks

Message-Id: <3n33qa$jf0@news3.digex.net>

On a unix system, I believe the standard mailbox name for each user is as 
specified above, with ? replaced by the user's login name.  I'd like to 
know if there is a standard document describing how those mailbox files 
are defined so I can read Unix mailboxes on a PC.  

I like the Pine mailer but I must use something akin to UUCP in order to 
be able to read and reply to mail off-line.  All of the mailers I've 
found either want to run under windows, will not simply exit to a batch 
file or issue a subtask call to a mail transporter program properly, or 
will not operate without a network connection.  I would probably use 
PC-Pine if I could get it to work under this scheme.

This is what I want to run, so any suggestions on changing what I want to 
do will be respected, but cheerfully ignored unless they cost nothing and 
are an order of magnitude easier than what I want to do.

Subject: imap without username/password
Date: 20 Apr 1995 11:26:38 -0400
Message-Id: <3n5ufe$84@eri.erinet.com>

I'm trying to install pine on a network of sun machines, and want to use 
our server machine for imap (currently we NFS mount the mail spool 
directories). However, I don't want our users to have to enter their 
username and password when they start pine. Reading the Pine Technical 
Notes (under installing imapd), it looks like I should be able to do this 
using the standard rsh mechanism.

Doesn't appear to work however, since I'm always prompted for username 
and password. Although the documentation only mentions creating a link to 
rimapd, I have also changed the inetd.conf file. 

In all honesty, I haven't dug through the code to figure this out - kinda 
hoping someone can save me that trouble. Any suggestions?

We use the mechanism that you describe, and no-one has to quote their 
password.  There are a number of reasons why it might be happening each 
time that you use Pine.  It may because of one or more of the following: 

(1) Your .cshrc file does output to the screen, e.g., it uses the
    echo command.  You will need to remove the appropriate command(s) 
    from the .cshrc file.

(2) Your .cshrc file contains one or more of the Unix commands biff, 
    mesg, stty.  Probably the command can be moved to your .login file.

(3) None of the above, in which case over to someone else.

Subject: New Mail Check from Remote Pine
Date: 19 Apr 1995 16:51:44 -0400
Message-Id: <3n3t50$avu@telerama.lm.com>

I use pine in a window on a workstation at work to monitor personal
email received at a local ISP.  I connect to the remote IMAP server
when I start pine in the morning.  Periodically, pine tells me there
is new mail.  There doesn't appear to be a way to force pine (other
than by existing and restarting) to do a new mail check.  It sometimes
appears that there is new mail available, but pine takes its time
about telling me that the new mail is available.  For example, I
usually read news on the ISP because they support a threaded
newsreader and Transarc (where I work) doesn't.  tin on the ISP will
tell me there is new mail, but it may take 10s of minutes before I
receive a new mail notification from pine on my local window.

Is there a way to force a check?  I couldn't find anything under other
commands.  Can the check interval be configured?

Thanks,
Barry

I've got procmail filtering my incoming mail and that part is working 
just fine.  The problem is that I've got my incoming folders and save 
folders in the same directory, and pine doesn't seem to know the 
diference.  When I try to "go" to a folder, it thinks I want an incoming 
folder and won't find the folder because it's not defined as incoming.  I 
have to actually cursor in the list to the folder I want for it to open 
it?  Does PIne behave differently if I put my incoming and save folders 
in different directories?  This is very inconvenient and if I can't solve 
it, I'm going back to having everything in one folder collection.

We created a printer called printerm with an interface file called termpr
that activates the print-thru (echo \033[5i) cats the file then closes the
print-thru ( echo \033[4i).  Interface file is appended, for reference.

Whether or not it solves this specific problem, it is a good idea to have 
something like 

#         skip remaining setup if not an interactive shell

if ($?USER == 0 || $?prompt == 0) exit

#          settings  for interactive shells

in the .cshrc file toseparatethose things that you always want from those 
things that you only want for an interactive shell.

Ok, here's my stoopid question for today, which I am sure is in the FAQ, 
which is where I would look if I knew where it was (hint, hint).....

Can you set up a file with a list of addresses and then use the filename 
as input for To:, CC: or BCC:?  I have a humungous distribution list that 
has my .addressbook swollen like, well, you don't want to know.

Any help would be appreciated.
Bruce

	Is this why I keep getting "out of memory" and "bug detected" errors
while testing the PC-NFS version of 3.91?  I don't see this problem
with the winsock version but I'd rather use the PC-NFS version.  Anyone
know of a fix/work-a-round?

Juanita,

The problem is that with multiple collections, Pine has to pick one as a
default, which is apparently not correct in your case.  You can change
between collections with ^N and ^P at the Goto prompt. 

Thanks for the request!

The mail check interval for Pine is 2.5 minutes.  To force an early check,
press ^L.

About the only thing you can do now is split your addressbook into a
couple different addressbooks and specify the filenames in the
Setup/Config screen...

I think Pegasus mail can do what you want (if you realy want to read mail
off-line using uucp---on my friend's company use this combination). If you
only want to use PC and have a direct connection to the Internet, IMAP and
some version of PC-PINE would be probably much better.=20

I think that if you set the option allowing multiple incomon folders (I=20
do not remember the name), you will be able to add all the other incoming=
=20
folders in your configuration screen. This should help (if I understood=20
you well).

Is it a way to configure pine so that I could edit the printing command=20
after pressing Y (i. e. not to have only the possibility to say yes, no=20
or cancel)? Thanks for answers.

Hi!

Is there a chance to read news with Pine 3.91 from a local spool 
directory? What file must I modify and how?
Thanks for help.

Set news-collections=*[] in the Setup/Config screen.  That should work for
the most common locations of the News spool directory and active file...

Pine 3.89 is about 1.5 years old.  You should upgrade them to the current
Pine 3.91 release...

Message-Id: <3mcb4b$np0@fsuj01.rz.uni-jena.de>


Hello, does anybody know how I can access new mails from
the mail spool directory via the "#mh" switch as a remote
MH folder.
If I try "{imap-server}#mh/INBOX" only the existing mails (that
were read previously) are seen, but no new mails.

On the other side, if I set the incoming-folder to
"{imap-server}INBOX" new mails are seen but an error is
returned while saving read mails into a remote MH folder.
A directory is created, but no mail file can be written.

The file is doc/pine-ports

Could someone please email me a copy of this file,

Hi !

For once, I hope one of your "bug-report" emails is not yetunnadder bug ;-)

How to "automate" pine?  I would like pine to run everyday in the morning
@ 5:00 to do some "saving work"  (save the articles from a newsgroup into
a file using ;AAS and a filename ?

pine < file 

is not legal ;-)   Sorry I had to send a "bug-report".  Couldn't 
locate an email address easily.

Seetamraju

P.S : Wow! What a comprehensive software?!!

Does anyone know if there is a version of mush which will
automatically encrypt and decrypt (via PGP) messages when they are
sent and received?

I'd also be open to versions of elm, mh, or pine which simulate a mush
interface that also have this functionality.

Thanks.

Does anyone know the switches to set when sending from Eudora->a MIME

My correspondant just sent me a file that had attachments 2.1 and 2.2!  
I've not seen fractional numbers before...Was one the "resource fork"?, 
and the other the rest? If there is a Mac user or other that might 
enlighten me, I would look forward to the email at the address below.

Many Thanks in advance.

[Apologies if you have already tried/done these... :-]

*  The standard way of testing such things is to try giving the 
equivalent rsh command from a client machine "by hand":

	rsh serverhost /etc/rimapd

This may then give you some useful information.  In particular, something 
like "access denied" implies that the server host doesn't trust your 
client for the rsh mechanism.

*  For the "rsh xxx /etc/rimapd" to work the server machine must "trust" 
the client.  This can be done on a per-user basis by having a suitably 
set up ".rhosts" file in each users' home directory (Be *careful* when 
setting these up!).  Alternatively a "global" file can be set up in the 
form of "hosts.equiv".

Hi,


Is there any plan for adding macros or shortcuts feature to Pine ? One can
already execute many commands when starting Pine (l,i, etc) it would also be
great to be able to record a shortcut to be allowed to use commands when
reading news, such as $ = ;aadxTAB when reading news groups to be able to
purge a news group from all its messages and check the next news group. 

Cheers
GB

Subject: Full newsgroups list HOWTO ?

A question concerning reading news from Pine : how can I get the full list of
all newsgroups in the folder list of Pine so that I can decide whether to
subscribe or not by hand ? When I use my newsrc file under PC Pine I just get
the list of the subscribed newsgroup and would like to check for other groups
and perhaps subscribe to them too. 

Thanks for advises
GB

I am experimenting with the CIRUS IMAP server. I have a mailbox, under 
the name of user.penev and I am trying to save to user.penev.radev Pine 
correctly generates the following command:

A00018 COPY 2 user.penev.radev

But it gets the following answer:

A00018 NO Mailbox does not exist

So why doesn't pine just create the mailbox. It usually offers to do so in
the filesystem mailboxes.

Hello,
	I have instaled pine3.91 and all works fine except the QP

	I do not have seen any compile option or parameter in the
	configuration option .pinerc that talks about QP.
	The question is:
	when I send text with 8bit characters (ISO-xxxx) pine always
	send the message with Quoted-Printable indeed of 8-bit.

	Please, some help.

	Thanks in advance.

   Back at the time I was using BITNET mail it was offered as a default
   the possibility to know whether a mail message was "read" or "discarded"
   by the recipient (in this context "read" meant in Unix terms moved
   from the inbox to another folder, and "discarded" deleted from inbox,
   the recipient may or may not *actually* read the content ...).
   The justification for that was that mail delivery was a store-and-
   forward process across many nodes, and could stop for some time in
   between.

   I thought the facility was handy, and occasionally used it.
   The waste of bandwidth was minimal.
   I DO NOT SHARE THE OPINION this is offensive on my privacy.

   Nevertheless what one should be interested in, is whether mail is
   delivered, and if the recipient is present at work to read it.

   Given the way internet mail is delivered, there should usually be
   no reason to check for delivery, unless a gateway is involved.

   If there is no gateway, either the mail is delivered almost imme-
   diately (one could turn a verbose flag in some mailing programs,
   I've seen it on Suns, or use /usr/lib/sendmail -v to send the mail
   and see the SMTP dialogue), or if the node is not reachable it
   queues up on the origin node.

   Command mailq (or /usr/lib/sendmail -bp) can be used by anybody
   to show the content of the mail queue.

   Otherwise one can inspect the /var/spool/mqueue/syslog

   Assuming therefore that one knows whether mail is delivered or not,
   one can then use "finger" to see if the recipient is logged on, or
   not and since when.

   This should settle the case if no gateway is involved.

   If a gateway is involved then it might be appropriate to ask for
   a return receipt, I've never done it myself but I know newer Pine
   versions allow to do it in the custom header.

   Again I feel this is pretty justified, and not violating anybody's
   privacy, nor being disturbing.
   ( I feel more disturbed when people try to get my attention in
    real time using programs like "write", "talk", or VMS PHONE, or
    a real telephone !)

Apply following patch then enable the 8bit option in Config
menu (enable-send-only-8bit, enable-8bit-in subject).

It seems pine 3.92 will add 8bit esmtp as a optional
feature.

Not to make it too easy for you..

make a named pipe file  
	mknod .sig-fort p

write a script which keeps writing to this file
	while 1
		fortune -s >> .sig-fort
	end

Have your sig be
	cat .sig .sig-fort

Hi,

I've installed Pine on our sysv4 system here and it is working great. I 
now have had a request to link up the PC's to the UNIX machine for mail.

We have a UNIX machine with an ethernet connection. The PC's are on a 
NOVELL network hooked into the Ethernet as well. All this is local - no 
internet access yet, but the UNIX box has an IP address and the NOVELL 
file server also has an IP address as well as the communication server.

We want to use PC-Pine for Windows. The way I understand it, PC-Pine acts 
as an smtp client and the UNIX box is the smtp server. We have downloaded 
PC-Pine and it is working ... but without accessing the mailboxes on the 
UNIX machine. (I get a message like '[host]: connection refused')

Problem: How do the PC's see their mailboxes on the UNIX machine. (normal 
acces from PC to UNIX is via a telnet process and a login/password deal).
On the PC's, the user names are: SAM (for example)
On the UNIX, the user names are: smiths (for the same user: sam smith) 

I get the feeling that this has something to do with IMAP but I am not 
sure. How is IMAP implemented? The documentation is scarce.

How does the WinSock stuff fit into this as well?

If you haven't guessed yet - PC's are not my strength - I am the UNIX guy.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
The possible connection between the PC's and UNIX promises to be 
*extremely* useful and popular with the people around here.

Thanks,
Marc Kneppers

You should be using #MHINBOX rather than #MH/INBOX.  It is a special
keyword that tells Pine to do the "inc" function...

This is how I do all my mail access.  In fact, I am planning to set it in 
the pine.conf.fixed so that all my 20,000 users are forced to use Pine 
in this manner (so that I can remove the NFS link to /var/spool/mail 
which we currently use and operate our mail fileserver as a sealed IMAP 
server).  I have noticed no difference in mail usage in the past six 
months I have been operating in this manner (except for the problem 
when Pine gets suspended and doesn't send NOOPs and the connection 
closes).  I don't think my users will even notice when I make the 
change (except that those users that use non-IMAP MUAs will be forced 
to switch to Pine).

Are you able to do other rsh commands from the login machine without a 
password?  Can you do "rsh imap-machine-name /etc/rimapd" without a 
password?  If not, you need to set the /etc/hosts.equiv or .rhosts file 
or the permissions on /etc/rimapd or on imapd such that you can.

This is probably in the FAQ, appologies if it is.

I am attempting to setup my mailcap file 
to call "/usr/local/bin/mpeg-play" for all
video files ending with the extension 
.mpeg

I have a line in my mailcap file that looks like;

video/*; /usr/local/bin/mpeg_play %s ; test=test -n "$DISPLAY"


I'm using pine 3.91 on HP-UX 9.01

Is there a way to automatically transform elm aliases

into pine addressbooks?

Thanks in advance for any information,

I have pine currently running on two unix boxes, one being DEC-ultrix and the

send mail to it without getting it returned back to me. I got the PINE package
from ftp.novell.de to install it on the unixware box. I have read documentation
on pine refering to a pine.conf file, but I couldn't find one on my unix 
system. If anyone has any ideas, please let me know.

I am trying to convert a local Unix mailbox to a CYRUS IMAP one. I opened
it with pine, ;)selected a)ll messages, and a)pplied s)ave to the IMAP
folder. Instead of pine quickly zipping through them (257 meaasges in lees
than 0.7M), I'm sitting for more than ten minutes, my disk is spinning
from time to time, and the machine is doing basically nothing. 

I inspected what is happening and saw, that the processes, that run are
mostly rsh and rshd. This is the mechanism for pre-authenticated logging,
which is not enabled for this server. /It is a different story, that a
search for 'authenticate' in the pine documentation does not produce a hit
to tell me how to force authentication./ So pine tries to invoke rimapd,
fails, connects to port 143, authenticates, saves a message, and exits.
And repeats this 257 times. Serially. It took about 25 minutes. 
Everything is on the local mashine -- no network, no NFS, nothing. To copy
0.7M?

Hi,


Could someone tell me how to specify the inbox path (IMAP syntax) so that
Pine read the a mailbox I have on a VMS system ? I tried the usual
{host.domain}inbox string but it doesn't work. 

Thanks for help

Message-Id: <3n5rh6$ic6@bigboote.WPI.EDU>

I am the moderator of a newsgroup (wpi.massacademy) and I want to use
pine to post other peoples articles to the newsgroup. I have already
added the needed Approved: header, but now everything I post is from 
me instead of from the original poster, as could be done using mail 
and inews. I tried adding the From: header, but Pine says I can't
change the from header. Is there any way to get pine to let me 
change this header, or any way to make the correct poster show in the
newsgroup?

Thanks!

I just blundered in here, and so don't know if this has already been
discussed, but how do you request a receipt in the customer header? That's
about the only thing I don't like about Pine ....

Thanks.

{much useful detail omitted}
 
As I understand it, there are basically two ways you can handle
this kind of situation.  You either go for a Novell-based mail
system within the PCs, with a gateway to interwork with the
Internet (Pegasus?), or you run a purely IP (Internet) based
email system on the PCs.  It looks as if you are following the
latter plan.  This factors Novell application levels out of your email
equation - but presumably you'll still be running their network
stack.  I'm not going to tell you that this is a good or bad way
to proceed - it depends on circumstances - in my area we go for
the IP-based solution too, because we are mainly interested in
Internet mail, but I know that other groups swear by Pegasus.

Assuming your network configuration is otherwise correct, this is
telling you that your unix system is not running an IMAPD server
(IMAP protocol daemon).  As you say you're the unix guy, this would
seem to be your job ;-)  Look for the IMAPD in the PINE distribution.
 
>How does the WinSock stuff fit into this as well?
 
Winsock is a well defined internal interface for IP network
transport on the PC.  Since you say you run Novell, you presuably
run an appropriate protocol stack already - look for its particular
Winsock interface routine.  An alternative is to look for its
packet-driver interface (ODIPKT if you presently run an ODI-based
stack) and run someone else's packet-driver-to-winsock
software (Tattam's Trumpet Winsock has a good reputation - shareware).
 
Bear in mind the "network layer cake model" - you just need the
correctly defined interface at each layer of the network cake.
alt.winsock is the group for discussing Winsock (but beware - many
usenauts on that group have not yet understood that Winsock is an
interface specification - they tend to think that the particular
implementation of Winsock that they are using is THE winsock, and
don't bother to tell us what it is).  There's also an IBM-PC IP
protocols FAQ that exhibits various baroque combinations of
networking stacks that different people use successfully for mixing
and matching ODI, NDIS, packet driver and/or Winsock software
interfaces.  It should be fairly easy to locate this FAQ.
 
>The possible connection between the PC's and UNIX promises to be
>*extremely* useful and popular with the people around here.
 
Well they can always TELNET to the unix system, log on, and run
PINE there, can't they, until you've got your act together...
 
good luck.

In .pinerc, add "Reply-To: " as a custom header.  Make sure you have full 
headers enabled.  It will only show up when you select Rich Headers (^R).

In an elder PINE you could use charset = ASCII, and PINE would not touch the
8-bit characters. Only if you use ISO Latin-1 Pine converts characters.

Yes it exists! ^W for *search*, the submenu that follows with the prompt

	^W followed by ^Y   takes you to first line of the document

	^W followed by ^V   takes you to last line of the document

Go and try that mate!

Official answer:

Pine is based on, and tries hard to adhere to, Internet mail standards.
Current Internet mail standards do not permit sending unencoded 8bit 
characters except when an 8bit connection has been negotiated via ESMTP.

Unfortunately, not eveyone agrees with the current Internet standards.  There
are areas in the world where it is considered acceptable to violate the
standards and "just send 8" even without a negotiated 8bit connection. 
Regrettably, a few have even created "outlaw" versions of Pine that violate
the standard, but no official version of Pine has ever done so.  (At 
least not intentionally.)

Version 3.92 will support negotiated 8bit connections via ESMTP's 
8BITMIME construct.

Hi,
Let me also put in a vote for macros or a scripting capability or the
like.  It would be great for e.g., sorting the mail when you subscribe
to a number of listservs.  I could put all my select, apply and save or
export commands in one macro.

Message-Id: <3nbd3d$gmc@mac95.ncook.k12.il.us>

I am trying to remain calm! When I logged on to my service I received a 
messaged stating that I had mail.  I knew I had 8 or 9 messages that I 
hadn't gotten to reading so I went to Pine to check them out.  Well, 
According the Pine I had 0 messages in my inbox.  Curious, I opened my 
inbox folder and got the message "Folder format invalidated (consult an 
expert), aborted"  YIKES!!!  I checked in my Saved Mail folder and those 
messages were fine.  
Well, I went back to my main menu because I have an option to fix my 
corrupted mail box.  I read the directions and unless I read it wrong, I 
have to delete each message line by line.  Is that right?  Most of my 
messeages are mailing list digests & are pretty lengthy.  
I decided it was expert consultation time.  And here I am.
Can anyone help me?  
One more thing that may or may not help.  I tried to open my mail through 
Elm (which I usually never bother with) and I can't even open that.  I 
get the message "Folder is corrupt!!  I can't read it!!"
I'm on my knees begging for assistance here.  Thank you so much for 
helping!!!!
p.s. - Don't send e-mail for obvious reasons  :)

Ditto.  This may be the single most annoying feature of pine.  I think
the number one item on my wish list for all data transfer software is the
"leave my data alone!" option.  Something that tells the program not to 
act so smart and to let me decide how I want to transfer the data when I
want.  These Q-P codes are causing no end to consternation on many listservs. 
First you have to tell people that their mail is getting converted, which they
find hard to accept, and then they blame the receiver.  Finally they accept 
that their wonderful Pine is the source.  And then we have to figure out
what causes it!  Please fix this in 3.92! I have, BTW, seen a patch for this 
on the Pine Web page (really FTP) 
ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs/tech-notes.txt but I can't install
it so I don't know how good it is.
I've incidentally had trouble forcing our 3.91 Unix pine at ASU to do it,
which makes actually figuring out how others can avoid it tough.
Aren't ^N, ^O, and ESC supposed to force it to use Q-P?  Or is it only
8-bit chars or what?  The documentation isn't particularly clear about it.

Had the same problem here, so gave it up and FTPd the precompiled 
binaries for Solaris from cac.washington.com.  It works just fine, 
although I had to create a couple of non-standard (for Solaris) 
directories to match the compilation.

OK, so I have two stoopid questions today...

Can anyone give me an idea how to set up a random sig generator, that

Just wondering,

The standard mailbox format is pretty simple.  It's named as you
described, /usr/spool/mail/apharris in my case.  Messages are separated
by a line like

>From mmwang@mv.us.adobe.com Mon Feb  6 03:04:25 CST 1995

There should be a blank line before the 'From ' line.
Anyhow, it's the 'From ' which is critical, *not* 'From:'.

I'm not sure if there's an rfc describing mailbox formats.  
You might try some unix mail newsgroups for more info, or
the unix mail faqs.

Hello.

This capability will be in a future version of Pine.  It is waiting on the
functional development of certain other technology which Pine is layered
upon.  When implemented, the keywords capability will be quite a bit more 
general and functional than in MM.

The Pine team is quite aware of the functionality of MM, and many of the
capabilities of MM (although not its user interface) influenced Pine and
especially its underlying mail handling engine.  I was the primary
developer of the original MM on the DEC-20 for over a decade.

Thanks very much for the clarification. And, I am glad to see that those 
behind MM live on. For a long time I wondered if MM would be adapted to 
new operating systems. Now I see that isn't necessary, for Pine is 
actually better in many respects.

A few features you might consider for the future include:

being able to 'take' an address to a _list_ within the address book
being able to force a mail check as you can in MM with 'ch'
have a way to turn off the option menus
be able to narrow searches by excluding text matches
be able to undo the most recent search narrowing
have a way to arrange mail folders other than horizontal alpha
   such as vertical alpha, and also by having sections of folders
   in alpha order within the given section

Perhaps some of these exist already, but I haven't spotted them yet.

In sum, Great Program!! :-)

Pico treats both Delete and Backspace as "backward-delete-char."  To 
"delete-char," use ^D.

You need atob and btoa, a pair of tools like uudecode/uuencode, only with
a better compression rate.

Should be available on the major FTP archives.

I realize that Pico is not the most robust editor ever written, nor is it

much easier to use.

Inability to search for regexps is not a problem; it's just a missing
feature.  But there are two problems with the editor that might screw up
people's files. 

1) The "long lines wrapped" problem.  When Pico reads in a file, if there 
   are lines longer than X, then the lines are split.

2) Out of memory.  If there is not enough memory, Pico will load the file
   as much as it can, but will leave off the lines at the end that it
   doesn't have room for.  (I have only observed this once, on a very 
   heavily loaded machine with a 200K file.)

Are there any plans to fix these?  A command line option that would
sacrifice speed for arbitrary line length might be a good idea.  And the 
truncating of a file is unacceptable.  If there isn't enough room, it 
should just say, "Sorry, I can't load the whole file."

This is on Pico 2.5

The change I have made is in file c-clients/osdep.h

comment out the line:
  #include <string.h>
  #include <unistd.h>

I use gcc 2.6.3 and it complains about the two lines. I use the sv4 
definition.

Hope that help.

I might have changed one or two other thing which I have forgotten.

Wai.

I am still having occasional long delays and sometimes even crashes
when composing a message. Maybe someon has had the same problem and
found a solution. 

I am using Pine 3.90 on a IBM AIX 3.1.

Date: 19 Apr 1995 17:44:56 GMT
Message-Id: <3n3i6o$kkt@news1.svc>

I have an alias defined in my addressbook that I want to be
able to send the mail to a UNIX command rather than an address.
In mailtool, I can simply compose an email message and send it
to |<command_name> and it will send the text of the email message
to the command stdin instead of to a person.

With pine, whenever I try to use the |<command_name>, it
appends my domain name on the end to look like this

  |<command_name>@corp.portal.com

Which of course does not work.

Can anyone help me?  Please email me directly.

Thanks in advance

Subject: RE:  Building Pine under Solaris 2.4
Cc: mse@wolverine.utias.utoronto.ca


Well, I finally got Pine to compile and installed on a
Sparc 20 running Solaris 2.4

Here is what I did:

1.) First I applied a patch (pine3.91.tar), but this didn't seem to
    make a difference.  I still got the same compile errors.
                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

2.) I then added a definition:  `-Dconst' to CFLAGS, in `makefile.sol'
    BUT this did not work, so I took it out again.
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

3.) I then made the following modifications to `./pine/makefile.sol':
    CC=cc
    LDCC=cc

    I also made the following modifications to `./pine/osdep/os-sv4.h':
    #define ANSI
    /*#define     const           */
    /*#define signal(a,b) sigset(a, b) */
    /*extern void (*sigset())();       */
    #define QSType void
    /*#define QSType char  */

With these definitions in `makefile.sol', and the above uncommented and
commented-out definitions in `os-sv4.h', Pine built with only a few
warning messages about ANSI-C compatibility.  (I also added the following
compiler options to the native cc Sun compiler: -fast -xcg92 -KPIC -Xa
but this shouldn't matter.)

Compiling with gcc didn't work at all, (even with the patch described in
`1.)' above).  In fact, gcc died a terrible death on `pico'.  I have
the Cygnus gcc compiler installed here.

So its DONE and Pine seems to work fine with no modifications other than
to the `makefile.sol' and `os-sv4.h' files.

Special thanks to:  David Drum, David L Miller, Chip Old, and Wai Ming Tai
for their responses.

Manfred.

Well, I did this quicky one some time ago. It works for me and it has
been helpful to others. It's free. Don't make money of it :-)
You do need Perl, however.

I am running into an email problem, but I'm not sure of the source.  And 
I'm a newbie UNIX system administrator.  I would appreciate any 
suggestions you might have!

We are running DG/UX 5.4R3.10 and pine 3.91.  Periodically a user is 
unable to receive mail.  The sender gets the mail back with:

UX:mail: ERROR: Creation of lockfile failed after 10 tries
UX:mail: ERROR: Cannot create dead.letter: Permission denied

On investigation I find files in /var/mail of the form eross.lock or 
eross.lock.798211577.2688.cccc where eross is the affected usercode.  If 
I delete the file the problem is resolved.

I found a number of users had .pine-crash files in their home 
directories, all of which contain near the end:

about to end_tty_driver
Pine Panic:  Received abort signal

I should mention that all users are on PCs telneting to the system.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions you might have!

Just a suggestion about your infinitely long list: have you considered 
enlisting some of the talent that is lurking about out here? 

We could be designing, coding, testing functions for you or is there 
something financial/political or just plain practical that doesn't make 
this idea feasible?

I have two questions:

1. In pine, when printing, how do I get the burst page shut off?

2. When viewing a newsgroup in pine hwo do you delete multiple messages 
   instead of hitting the d key many times over?

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks

what IMAP server is running on the VMS system? if it is running PMDF's 
IMAP server, then the syntax should work. You can tell if it running 
PMDF's IMAP server by telneting to port 143 of the system.

David,
The challenge is software management.

The ideal case for this type of assistance is to find an enhancement that 
involves one or a few modules that are not involved in the other work
going on --otherwise we end up spending a lot of time synchronizing and 
re-integrating source code.  

There are not a lot of enhancements that can be easily isolated; that is,
most involve modules that already have several sets of fingers modifying
them.  However, there are some: for example, quite a few people have asked
for a mailbox driver that automatically compresses and uncompresses.  Such
a project could be done with minimal coordination, but so far no one has 
volunteered...

This is almost certainly a mistake.  Signal semantics for Solaris and other
SVR4 variants are quite different from earlier UNIXes.  Check
comp.unix.solaris and the Solaris Porting FAQ.

There is no native Sun cc compiler, they are all add-ons now.

Did you run the fixincludes according to the Cygnus install instructions?
All versions of gcc depend on that crucial step to get their include files
setup right.

Many people have done it.  You must have gotten a step wrong.

Does any of you know anything about Ispell working under DG/UX systems ? 
or maybe any other speller that is much better than the UNIX speller, 
something that can give suggestions for spelling mistakes.

Try Pine 3.91 and get yourself upgraded to at least AIX 3.2.5. I don't 
even think IBM still supports 3.1

Since pico is basically a minimal uEMACS, why not just
"enable-alternate-editor-explicitly" and use GNU emacs or one of the emacs
subsets or clones such as jed or jove?  I use jove.

    Well, curses(3).  It seems that the NNTP host to which I originally

attempt to post it again to the newsgroups.
    This lag provided me with time to check on yet another 8BITMIME ESMTP

the zmailer list.  Comments about this server have been added.

    Given that Pine3.92 will be supporting the 8BITMIME ESMTP option, it
then becomes the responsibility of the MTA to guarantee proper delivery
of 8BITMIME mail to the recipient, performing any conversions as are
needed to get the message through any intermediate MTAs without losing
any of the information originally contained in the message.
    (For a description of the 8BITMIME ESMTP option, refer to RFC 1652.
In this RFC, an MTA is given two options -- either convert the message,
or bounce it as undeliverable.  It is to be hoped that few, if any, MTAs
would choose the latter course, so instead we concentrate on the conversion
of the 8-bit message to some 7-bit-safe equivalent.)

    At present, there are relatively few MTAs which claim to speak the
8BITMIME needed to properly handle the message.  The ones I know of are:
PMDF
certain versions of the Mercury NLM for Novell LANs
newer versions of zmailer from Matti Aarnio
and, not yet released, BSD Sendmail v8.7.
[A version of BSD v8.6 integrated with Emil1.1 was discovered and tested.]

    From what I can tell, PMDF is conformant to the RFC, as will be the
default configuration of sendmail v8.7.  However, bouncing a variety of
experimental messages off the other MTAs revealed that they don't quite
match the performance expected by the RFC.  (To their credit, they don't
bounce the message, which I would consider a hindrance to the widespread
use of 8BITMIME in preference to the present widespread practice of
JustSend8 mail with the possibility of loss of data or even bounced mail.)

    My bounce tests were performed by composing a MIME message with an
8-bit text/plain part, which I then sent with an 8-bit-clean version of
BSD Sendmail v8 (does not convert from 8-bit to 7-bit equivalent) to an
8BITMIME mailer to get the conversion needed to conform to the RFC in the
ESMTP dialog.  The resulting 8BITMIME message was then delivered to the
mailer in question, with a destination address of a non-8BITMIME MTA,
often a version of IDA sendmail which is decidedly *not* 8-bit clean.
The proper behavior of the MTA under attack in this fashion should be to
convert the message to a 7-bit form by either BASE64-ing it, or converting
it to a QUOTED-PRINTABLE-ized form.  The RFC states that in no circumstances
should the suspect MTA try to deliver 8-bit data.

    The JustSend8 to 8BITMIME conversion was usually performed by a version
of zmailer, with 8BITMIME support added by Matti Aarnio.  The log files on
the host indicate that the MAIL command of the ESMTP dialog conformed to
the RFC, even though the original incoming message arrived with SMTP as
JustSend8 8-bit data.

    The version of PMDF running at Innosoft performed conversions of MIME
text/plain messages with no problems.  I also generated a multipart/mixed
message with two body parts of text/plain with 8-bit data, which PMDF was
able to handle properly.  (At least, in a way which would not affect the
content of the multipart messages which Pine creates, which consist of one
text/plain part, and any number of attachments [text, image, application]
already made mail-safe in BASE64 form.)

[   The version of BSD sendmail v8.6 with Emil was tested and appeared to 
work like PMDF -- it had no problems converting text/plain or multipart 
messages.  My only observation was that it applied the local tagging of 
charset="iso-8859-1" to those messages which arrived with JustSend8 and 
which were handed off with SMTP when those messages had no MIME headers, 
as opposed to the suggested tagging of the character set as unknown.]

    At the time of my play^H^H^H^Hexperimentation, half a year or more ago,
Eric Allman was only mentioning incorporating 8BITMIME support into BSD
sendmail.  Even today, no 8.7.1 release has made it out, so there is no
way for me to test the compliance of it, though that will be one of the
first things I test when it does get released, Real Soon Now.

    However, the behavior of Mercury showed that, while the banner it
provided would lead one into believing it supported 8BITMIME messages
and all that this implies, my tests showed otherwise.  The version that I
pounded on was 1.13, which was configured to pass all mail it received with
a destination outside its domain to BSD sendmail v8.6 for delivery.  As
this version of sendmail makes no claim to handle 8BITMIME data, the
proper response of Mercury should have been to make the conversion, which
it did not do.  As a result, I only saw the stripped 7-bit equivalents of
the message I was sending in the IDA destination mailbox.
    Perhaps this announcement of 8BITMIME was intended for incoming mail
which would get delivered locally and never make it out.  But as soon as
one would make use of Mercury for handling outgoing mail, or use it as
SMTP server, or if a recipient on the other side of Mercury were to forward
mail elsewhere, mail which might be intended as 8BITMIME data suddenly
becomes JustSend8 data.  When I checked the system I had tortured before,
I discovered that the version of Mercury running had been upgraded to 1.20,
and it no longer laid claim to being able to speak 8BITMIME to the world.

    The moral behind this part of my research is that one should not point
Pine3.92 at a Mercury 1.13 SMTP server and attempt to speak 8BITMIME, and
that sites running 1.13 should upgrade their version to avoid advertising
the false claim of conformance to RFC 1652.  This should be no problem for
configuration of Pine, since one must select whether one wants Pine (or
PC-Pine) to try to send mail with 8BITMIME if the SMTP server claims to
support it -- it's not the default, from what I've been told.

    The problem of zmailer is a bit more complicated.  I was using it to
generate the ESMTP 8BITMIME dialog, for which it performed admirably when
speaking to an 8BITMIME ESMTP server regardless of top-level message type
(text/plain or multipart/mixed).  If I were to send JustSend8 mail to it
for delivery to a non-8BITMIME MTA, it would add MIME headers and convert
to QUOTED-PRINTABLE encoding.  If I were to send JustSend8 mail with MIME
C-T-E: 8BIT headers, it would convert the text/plain message to Q-P for
delivery.  So it was able to handle simple single-part messages well.

    However, my tests half a year ago revealed problems handling multipart
messages.  The mea version of zmailer did not recognize them, and would
convert the entire message to Q-P, adding its own MIME headers for the
unknown charset it believed it was being presented with.  In other words,
it simply did not understand multipart messages when any part of them had
an 8BIT content.  The resulting mail that was sent out ended up garbled
so that a MIME-aware MUA could not make sense of the attachments, but would
display the entire message.  In other words, zmailer, while claiming support
for 8BITMIME, could only handle single-part messages properly.

    That was then, this is several months later.  Luckily, zmailer is one
of those programs that is actively being worked on thanks to Matti.  So,
again, I dragged out my multipart 8-bit mail and repeated my tests, since
there was a new version, different from the one I had tested earlier.  This
time my tests were not as thorough -- I simply handed the JustSend8 mail
directly to the zmailer in question, rather than running it through another
zmailer to perform the 8BITMIME dialog according to the RFC (my guess was
that if zmailer treated JustSend8 mail as 8BITMIME incoming, it would still
do so regardless of content-type).

    I didn't try the untagged JustSend8 mail with this pass, and I don't
think that I tried JustSend8 mail with MIME headers, as I had already made
my tests with those earlier and didn't think zmailer's behavior would be
any different.  However, there was a distinct change in the way my multipart
message was handled.  Luckily, the top-level headers were left intact.  This
means that any MIME-aware MUA would have no difficulty recognizing an
attachment from Pine (I understand that Pine will still use BASE64 encoding
for attachments as it does now).  This is quite an improvement over the
previous behavior.  On the other hand, no attempt was made to convert the
message parts with C-T-E of 8BIT.  This means that my IDA mailbox received
the 7-bit stipped equivalents of the characters I was testing.  In other
words, the zmailer I tested handles text/plain messages as 8BITMIME
messages, but it handles multipart messages as JustSend8 messages.

    Thus, we come to the reason behind this excessively long post.  I've
posted this to the MIME group in case some generous soul there happens to
want to take a look at zmailer and offer the code needed for it to perform
the complete 8BITMIME conversion for all parts of a message.  My guess is
that it shouldn't be too difficult, as top-level conversion is implemented
adequately.  But then, I don't write code.  With this, then zmailer's
claim to be 8BITMIME-compliant will be much less likely to cause problems.

    I'm also including this in both the zmailer and Pine discussion lists,
as any SysAdmin who runs both should be aware of this incompatibility of
zmailer with the upcoming Pine3.92.  Again, maybe someone who likes to hack
on zmailer code would volunteer to contribute the changes needed.

    And I'm asking this of the Pine developers:  Given that zmailer claims
8BITMIME support, and indeed is able to handle text/plain messages, which
in my opinion would be the bulk of the messages with 8-bit data it would
receive from Pine3.92, but has difficulty with multipart messages, would
it be possible to include in Pine, in addition to the option to speak
8BITMIME to the SMTP server, an option to disable 8BITMIMEspeak when
sending multipart messages and the first option is set, for peaceful
co-existence with zmailer?

    My reasoning behind this is as follows...  If Pine will be sending
its data in Q-P or BASE64 form anyway if the ESMTP dialog fails to reveal
an 8BITMIME server, it should be simple to add code to detect if the message
is multipart and act similarly.  This should be a temporary thing, as I am
guessing that eventually zmailer will have full 8BITMIME compliance.  And,
as zmailer is one of a small number of MTAs which attempt to conform to
8BITMIME, helping to advance its acceptance in a world where JustSend8 is
preferred by many over QUOTED-PRINTABLE, and is seeing use in environments
where 8-bit data is commonly used for text mail, I'd hope that people would
be willing to accommodate it to work around its present shortcomings.  (I
don't know how many sites use zmailer.)  Furthermore, MIME multipart messages
are much less useful to a recipient without a MIME MUA, while text/plain
messages delivered with 8BITMIME are readable by the majority of mailreaders,
certainly those in use where JustSend8 non-English text prevails, and so
the loss of sending multipart messages with Q-P is rather insignificant.

    I am guessing that with the upcoming release of BSD Sendmail v8.7,
and the ability of Pine3.92 to make use of 8BITMIME ESMTP servers, the
use of 8BITMIME in sending mail will increase such that eventually zmailer
will have to fully conform, or drop its claim, in order to co-exist with
sites that still run 7-bit MTAs like my IDA site.  Then, instead of people
complaining about the MUAs like Pine using Q-P, they can focus on upgrading
the MTAs to speak 8BITMIME so that a good proportion of mail can be
delivered with 8-bit data intact, and in easily readable form.

This is the default action (signature-at-bottom) for reply, but not for

I don't think there is a simple setup option to do this.  I believe it is
done this way to distinguish a forwarded message from a reply.  Forwarded
messages are not quoted.  There is probably some RFC out there which says
to do it this way.  If you really need to do this, you could get fancy
with editor macros.

About two months ago, I suddenly lost the ability to print from Pine to 
my local printer using the "Y" command.  When I press "Y" for Print and 
answer yes to the "Print to "attached-to-ansi"? question, the message 
prints to the screen instead of to my printer.  This problem occurred at 
the same time both at home: '386 to Epson FX-85 and at work: '486 to HP 
LJ III.  It also is consistent across at least two terminal 
emulators--both windows-based.  

Is this likely to be a problem with my Pine Setup?  If so, what should I 
check?  Or is it possibly a problem with the Pine program or setup used 
by my local access provider?  I thought I'd post here first and try my 
local sysop next if no one has any better ideas on what I might be doing 
wrong.  I've been making do by saving messages to my hard drive and 
printing them throught MS-Word, but this is the slow way.

Thanks for any ideas/help you can provide.

What are the .pine-debug* files for? Debugging? 8-)
How can I avoid their creation?

Not at this time.  Pine will happily send as big a message as the sending

You can uncomment the "ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM" line in pine/os_???.h in the
Pine source and rebuild to get a version that allows you to change the
From: header...

Our internal mail system requires some addresses to be "chained" through 
others, such as user@machine1@machine2.

Pine 3.91 does not like this format, and produces "junk at end of 
address: @machine2"

Can this be fixed? I don't have the problem with DEC's TeamLinks or Sun's 
Mailtool.

Pine 3.92 will have an option to switch the behavior of DEL from 
backspace to ^D.

We've got a user with about 200 names in a distribution list. When she 
adds them, the first few show up on a line entitled DISTRIBUTION LIST in 
her addresbook but the vast majority get prepended to the whole list as 
comma and tab separated before even her regular addressbook entries. I 
took the addressbook, edited everything back into place but when accessed 
again the 190 or so names were prepended in the file.

Also, when she puts the name of the Distribution List in the To: field or 
the BCC: field to limit exposure, it immediately disappears after the 
return is pressed.

Is there some limit to the number of names in the list? I didn't see 
anything in the docs, but may have missed something. Allegedly, this was 
not a problem on another system running 3.89. We're running SunOS 4.1.3 
and 3.91.

Along the same vein...Pine doesn't seem to be able to reattach 
multimessage split MIME code. (Ultimail from IBM comes to mind here)

Is there any way to force a mail check? I don't like having to quit Pine 
and start it up again repeatedly when I am waiting for mail to arrive.

Pine 3.92 will have an option to enable/disable the 8BITMIME support, but
we haven't considered a seperate toggle for single/multipart...

I have a requirement to provide pine for a user base that uses wyse60 
terminals. All keys use standard wyse codes. I would prefer to use the 
function key mode if possible as most of the users are not experienced. I 
managed to modify ttyin.c to recognise the wyse function keys in pine, 
but when you go into the composer (pico), it doesn't know anything about 
the function keys. 

I noticed that tcap.c is where pico sets up allowable sequences for 
function keys, etc. but I can't get it to work for the wyse 
function keys where F1 = ^A@^J, F2 = ^AA^J, F3 = ^AB^J, ....

1. Has anyone got pine to work with wyse60 terminals?
2. Does function key mode really work?


regards,
Ben

I'm using PINE 3.91 and am trying to change the value for "default-fcc"
(which is now <Empty Value>).  It never takes.  The helpfile says make
sure you have "fcc-name-rule" set to default.  I do.  The default-fcc
parameter still goes away when I reset it (and none of my outgoing mail
is getting saved, which is presumably the purpose of the fcc parameter).  
What am I doing wrong or omitting?!

Hi Jose,
This what I read in pine frequent asked questions:

 o You can suppress the creation of .pine-debug files by running with
   debugging turned off, i.e. invoke "pine -d 0".  Note, however, that
   this will prevent recording data that might be essential to solving
   a problem you encounter.  Pine normally keeps the last four pine-debug 
   files in your Unix home directory.


P.s. If you like I can E-mail you the questions I have on pine.

There are currently two ways to force a new mail check. 
     * Press `Ctrl-L' (Refresh Display). 
     * At the last message in a folder, press 'N' 4-5 times. 

Also, you can enable-mail-check-cue in your setup/config so pine will 
display an astrik (*) in your upper left corner whenever pine is checking 
for new e-mail.  Something else you would like to know is that pine 
checks for new mail every 2.5 minutes, you might be able to change that, 
but I don't know how to do that yet.

To check a PGP signature you just need to "pipe" your message to the
pgp command.

I use vi as my alt-editor and have the following in my .exrc file to
assist me in email composition.

	^[ = A quoted <ESC> character
	^M = A quoted RETURN character.  
	Both of these can be inserted in vi using a ^v (control V)

" Format paragraph to 75 columns
map ^[p !}fmt -c -75^M
"
" Spell check file (NOTE: saves current edit session)
map ^[s :w!^M:!ispell %^M:e!^M^M
"
" PGP sign the message (NOTE: saves current edit session)
map ^[S :w!^M:!pgpsign %^M:e!^M^M

I have not done it yet, but a PGP encrypt script would not be hard to
write.  The only problem is the user name would have to be entered by
hand.

The short pgpsign script is attached.  I know this is a hack but it will
work until 3.92.

Please don't ask me pgp questions check ftp://rtfm.mit.edu for FAQ
information.  While some of you "newbies" are at it read the pine FAQ.

This is a known problem with pine/sendmail.  Pine is doing nothing wrong 
- it is conforming to RFC822 in allowing continuation lines in fields as 
long as they are indented.  

This syslog comes about because versions of sendmail previous to 8.6.9 
had a major security problem in it with newlines appearing in the From 
line.  Therefore Eric Allman (who wrote sendmail), got sendmail to log 
this as a warning to sysadmins.  This was seen as a problem in 8.6.9 and 
the code was changed slightly in 8.6.10 to try to stop these spurious 
messages.  This did not always work so it was changed again.

The message is nothing to be worried about but you still need to be 
vigilent as someone could use the security hole to "break" into your machine.

The latest version of sendmail is 8.6.12 and I would suggest that you get 
this.  This seems to be better at trapping some of these spurious 
warnings and also fixes anothe security problem with the use of the IDENT 
protocol.

Start PICO with the -w switch and it will turn off word wrap.  E.g.,

    pico -w index.html

I haven't encountered this (yet?) so can't speak to it.  I agree,
however, about this business of truncating.  Similarly with line
length.  If the line, or file, is too long, the program truncates.
Excuse me but the info is there for a reason, either don't load or
leave it alone.

Can PC-Pine be used as a command line mailer?  I need the ability to mail 
a file off to a remote user from inside a DOS batch script.  Can Pine do 
this?  If not, does anyone have any ideas on another program that can 
help me out?

Thanks in advance for the help,

The first thing is to check with your local support staff to see if any 
delivery filter programs are installed on your system.  Then take a look 
at the Filtering Mail FAQ by Nancy McGough:

Hi all,

I am trying to compile Pine 3.91 under solaris 2.3 with no luck.

In the actual pine directory I am running make like this:

make -f makefile.sol

cc -DSV4   -g -DDEBUG -DSYSTYPE=\"SOL\"   -c addrbook.c -o addrbook.o
"/usr/include/unistd.h", line 171: identifier redeclared: rename
        current : function(pointer to char, pointer to char) returning int
        previous: function(pointer to const char, pointer to const char) returning int : "/usr/include/stdio.h", line 112
"addrbook.c", line 3954: cannot recover from previous errors
cc: acomp failed for addrbook.c
make: *** [addrbook.o] Error 2

How do I get around this problem?

Upgrade to sendmail-8.6.12 - it was altered to stop logging long 
addresses generated by the likes of pine.

Hi,
sometimes PINE displays messages with the To: xxxxxx

E.g. In my open news folder I  get

It's probably one of your users running pine, which makes 8.6.10 unhappy
with the To: header when the sender sends email to more than one recipient.
Just get the latest version of sendmail (I believe we're up to 8.6.12?)
and the problem goes away.  :)

I'm having problems with my pine -- sometimes when my INBOX gets large
(over 50 pieces) I start seeing "[ No message text ]" in the index.

When I read it, it's sometimes a duplicate or piece of an existing mail.
I can try to delete it but the "D" doesn't show.  When I exit and get
back into pine, any mail deleted is still there, plus duplicates at 
the end, with a flag of "N" for new. It just gets worse with each
exit and re-entry with more duplicates.

I have to use UNIX mail, and sometimes at the latest mail at the top
I see how junk "#$%^#$%' type characters.  When I use 'd' , pine then
restores some sanity.  

Has anyone see this?  Even if you have or have not, can someone offer
some advice on this?  Thanks in advance.

Message-Id: <d.j.evans-2604951741280001@skmc1.rdg.ac.uk>

I'm trying to share an address book between PINE 3.91 and another mail
package (ECSmail).  I can access the global address book, but can't paste
the entries into the T0: (or any other fields) in PINE.

I can ^T and get the full address book listing, so the path and read
access seems OK, but when I type E (exitselect) or press return the
address isn't pasted.  Needless to say the aliases don't work either ....
!

It's not quelling address checking because if I send a message I'm told
that there are no recipients ......

I should add that it appears specific to my username - everything works
fine from the other couple I've tried !

Any ideas ?

Replies by e-mail if possible, unless this is of sufficient importance for
general consumption.

Thanks in advance.

Message-Id: <D7n1vt.3D6@itex.jct.ac.il>
Date: Wed, 26 Apr 1995 10:45:29 GMT


Hello all,

  In elm it's possible to leave read messages in the incomming mail file,
meaning I can leave a message there until I deal with it. Pine doesn't seem
to support this option. It considers every read message as deleted ('D') when
exiting. This really sucks, pardon the expression. I got around it by
undeleting all the messages I want to keep, expunging all the ones I want to
delete and then exiting. This is of course error prone (I made the error
today :-( ) and inelegant.
  Isn't there any way I can just tell the system to treat deleted/saved massges
in a different maner than read messages? i.e. NEVER to have 'D' appear next
to a message that was read but not deleted or saved? maybe an option in
.pinerc I missed or misunderstud?

Please reply by e-mail.

TIA,

pine is the mailer that followed elm (and I think elm was just short for
ELectronic Mail), and pine originally stood for "Pine Is Nearly Elm."  Later,
as the features changed sufficiently, it came to stand for "Pine Is Not Elm."

I hate it that I know these things...

Yeah, but I think what you're really doin' is working on a PC connected 
to an internet server, which is running unix, and the unix keyboard 
deletes the character before the cursor, you're not in DOS at that 
point.  Your PC is not working as a computer really, just as a terminal.  
Yes you can re-map it, but it's probably simpler just to learn a few 
basic unix commands.  Only my 895 cents worth.   BYE.

You can't change it.  Personally I think the pc-pine version should allow   
this to be modified.  Most other winsock mail programs do, and I haven't   
heard any ISPs complain about network overload.  Maybe edu and other   
sites are different.

Of *course* it can be changed!  It's only a program compiled from source 
code files.  Change the appropriate magic number in the source file (many 
others have given the name of the relevant file elsewhere in other 
messages) and recompile.

	So, I'm lead to believe he is speaking about pc-pine.  I've not
seen the source of pc-pine on ftp.cac.washington.edu so I suspect it
is not an easy task to recompile.

I have used Pine 3.89 and Pine 3.91 with AIX 3.2.5, and it works fine.  Try 
upadating your AIX version level to at least 3.2.5.  

Previous to version 3.2.5, a large number of UN*X programs would not run on 
AIX.  AIX did not become fully POS*X compatible until version 4.?.

[I accidentally deleted the message I wanted to reply to, but...]

Ed Greshko commented that he'd never seen the PC-Pine source code 
available at Washington, so presumed it wasn't possible for us Mere 
Mortals to build it...

I'd always assumed that the various ".dos" and ".win" files, in 
particular "makefile.win" used by a "build win" would produce you a 
PC-Pine from the same distribution kit as as "normal" UNIX Pine.

Perhaps I was wrong in assuming this?

Ummm... I think you're making a wrong assumption, or using Pine wrongly...

Just reading a message in Pine does NOT mark it with a "D" in the Message 
Index indicating it should be deleted.  A message only gets marked as "D" 
if you tell it to be using the D command, or save the message into 
another folder (which implies the original should be marked "D").

Are you using the D command to move between messages?  If so, try using N 
(Next) instead.

It may also be that your systems administrator (or yourself) has set the
"read-message-folder" item and "auto-move-read-msgs" feature in Pine's
Setup Configuration screen.  This automatically moves messages you have
read out of the INBOX into the nominated folder as you quit Pine.  Yes,
the messages are deleted from the INBOX, but only because they have been
copied elsewhere; you can get to them again by opening that folder.  This
is NOT the default behaviour, but must be explicitly selected either by
individuals or globally by the System Administrator, and is quite useful
for "encouraging" people to waste (sorry! *use*) their own disk storage
for all those "essential"  mail messages rather than the (usually
un-quota'd) mail delivery area.

       Well now, what other choices are there??  It could run them off the

word wrap OUTGOING text at about 70 columns (72 max), so that when 
someone includes all or part of your message in the reply, and adds the : 
or the > or the # in front, it's still less than 80 columns.
       Same thing occurs when you ^R read in files.  If the file you're 
reading in is more than 80 columns, don't blame pico, reformat it first, 
then read it in.
       Now I suspect that when I try to post this, I'm gonna get a

A: The answer depends on your newsreader and mailer but the 
   procedure below works for many Unix newsreaders and mailers.

=======                 ==============
cd                      Change to your home directory (i.e., $HOME or ~)

pico .signature         Use the pico editor to create a .signature file.
                        (Replace "pico" with another editor if you like.)

<your signature>        Note that most systems require your sig to be <= 4
                        lines.  And it's good netiquette to make it as
                        short as possible.

<save and exit>         In Pico use ^x to exit and answer y when asked
                        if you want to save your changes.

chmod 644 .signature    Make .signature readable by all.

chmod a+x .             Make home directory searchable by all.

Subject: ... 1.2 Specific Mailer & Newsreader Instructions

For some newsreaders and mailers the above is all you need to do to
set up your signature.  For example the default behaviour of pine(1),
tin(1), and the rn family - rn(1), trn(1), strn(1), & Pnews(1) - is
to automatically append ~/.signature, if it exists.  To check that
it's working, follow the instruction in "1.3 Testing Your Signature."

If you use Elm, Mail, SUN OpenWindows Mailtool, Emacs Mail Mode, MH,
NN, or GNUS you need to follow the additional instructions described
below.  If you use Pine, you can change it's default signature
behaviour by following the instructions below.

------------------------------

Subject: ... ... 1.2.1 Pine
Followup-To: comp.mail.pine

Pine automatically appends ~/.signature (if it exists) to your messages.  
Many people like to set the signature-at-bottom variable which will put 
your signature below both your message and the message you are replying 
to (if you've included it).  Note that if you are forwarding a message 
your signature will be put below the message that you write but above 
the forwarded message.

Subject: ... ... ..... 1.2.1.1 Pine 3.90 and Later
Followup-To: comp.mail.pine

Pine automatically appends ~/.signature (if it exists) to your messages.  
To change Pine's signature features:

1. From the Main Menu type S for Setup
2. Type C for Configuration
3. To change the value of the signature-at-bottom feature:
   a) Spacebar and arrow down to the signature-at-bottom variable
   b) Type X to set/unset this variable.
4. To change the name of your signature file:
   a) Arrow down to the signature-file line
   b) Type C for Change Value
   c) Type the path and name of the file you want to use for your
      signature.  Note that ~ can be used for your $HOME directory.

Subject: ... ... ..... 1.2.1.2 Pine 3.89 and Earlier
Followup-To: comp.mail.pine

Pine automatically appends ~/.signature (if it exists) to your messages.  
To change Pine's signature features in Pine 3.89 (and earlier versions) you 
need to edit your ~/.pinerc file directly.

Type...                 In order to...
=======                 ==============
cd                      Change to your home directory (i.e., $HOME or ~)
pico .pinerc            Use the pico editor to edit your .pinerc file.
^w                      Search for . . .
feature-list            . . . ``feature-list''


Edit your .pinerc so that it contains this line:

feature-list=signature-at-bottom

If you want more than one feature in your feature-list then they need to
be comma separated like this:

feature-list=old-growth,
	signature-at-bottom


If you want to use a file other than ~/.signature for your signature
edit the following line:

signature-file=

From: FAQ Editor <faq-editor@ii.com>
Subject: ... ... 1.2.2 Elm
Followup-To: comp.mail.elm

In addition to the basic signature instructions in 1.1 above, users of Elm
need to edit their ~/.elm/elmrc file so that it contains the following:

signature = ~/.signature
sigdashes = ON

Remember to delete any # characters before any variables you want
to set.  The defaults are indicated in comment lines starting with ###.

NOTE
====
The signature variable sets both the localsignature and
remotesignature variables.  If you want to have a different signature
for local mail (i.e., addresses that don't contain a ! or @) then you
can use the localsignature and remotesignature variables instead of
the signature variable.

From: Jym Dyer <jym@remarque.berkeley.edu>
Subject: ... ... 1.2.3 Mail
Followup-To: comp.mail.misc

=o= Regular Unix "Mail" and "mail" don't have an automatic
signature mechanism.  Many people who normally use a more deluxe
mail utility occasionally find themselves resorting to using one
of these, in which case all you need to know is this command:

	~r $HOME/.signature

This simply tells Mail to include the text of the your signature
file.

=o= If you use Mail on a regular basis you may want to use the
semi-automatic signature feature.  When you're done typing your
message, you append a signature with this command:

	~a

=o= In order for this to work, though, you need to set the
"sign" mail variable.  There are two ways to implement this
variable.  The first is to set it in a $HOME/.mailrc file with
a command like this:

	set sign="Jym Dyer <jym@remarque.berkeley.edu>"

If your signature is more than one line long, you can use the
C language string syntax, as in these examples:

	set sign="Jym Dyer\n<jym@remarque.berkeley.edu>"

			-or-

	set sign="Jym Dyer\
	\n<jym@remarque.berkeley.edu>"

=o= The disadvantage of doing this in your .mailrc file is
that you now have to maintain the text of your signature in
two places.  Another approach that avoids this problem is to set
"sign" as an environment variable in your shell startup script.
For a Bourne-compatible shell, this is done with this command:

	sign="`cat $HOME/.signature`" export sign

For a C-shell, do this:

	setenv sign "`cat $HOME/.signature`"

From: Jochen Bern <bern@uni-trier.de>
Subject: ... ... 1.2.4 SUN OpenWindows Mailtool

The mailtool of SUNs OpenWindows lacks numerous Things, including the
Ability to sign Mails. However, most OW Users stick with mailtool
because of the Ability to use "Attachments" to send around Files.

A simple Replacement for Signatures is to add a "Template" (click on
Edit -> Properties, select Category "Template" in the Properties
Window, and give Name and File as desired). Disadvantage: You have
to edit in every Signature by Hand, though.

A better Approach is to use a "set sendmail=..." Line in your ~/.mailrc.
Mails being sent out will be handed over to the Executable named
there instead of the Mail Delivery Subsystem. You can easily plug
in a simple Program to sign your Mails there. However, be warned that
all too simple Siggers aren't aware of the abovementioned Attachments,
so the Signature will end up in the last Attachment instead of the
Mail Text. Information about a Sigger that handles mail containing
attachments correctly can be obtained from Jochen Berg by sending
email to: mailtool-sig@ti.uni-trier.de

From: Jym Dyer <jym@remarque.berkeley.edu>
Subject: ... ... 1.2.5 Emacs Mail Mode

=o= Emacs Mail Mode is usually invoked with the "mail" or
"mail-other-window" commands (bound, respectively, to the
"C-x m" and "C-x 4 m" keys by default).  It is also invoked
from various Emacs mail and news packages.

=o= Mail Mode provides a "mail-signature" command to append
the contents of your signature file to the end of your mail
message.  This command is bound to "C-c C-w" by default,
so to insert the signature before mailing, simply type
"C-c "C-w".

=o= If you'd prefer to have your signature automatically
appended to the end of your mail message, the "mail-signature"
command can be put into your "mail-setup-hook" variable in
your $HOME/.emacs file, as in this example:

    (setq mail-setup-hook
      (function
       (lambda ()
	 (mail-signature) )))

This will put the signature in your mail message buffer.


Instructions for Version 19 by Richard Kasperowski and Matt Kaufmann

There is a problem with my expression with respect posting to USENET
via GNUS.  GNUS automatically appends .signature to the post when it
is sent out.  With (setq mail-signature t), .signature is appended to
the end of the emacs buffer in which you edit your post.  When you
send-out the post, another .signature is appended to the end.  You end
up with two .signatures on your USENET posts.


If you prefer, you can use the following minor modification
of the version 18 form shown above:

Subject: ... ... 1.2.6 MH and Emacs mh-e
Followup-To: comp.mail.mh

=o= MH doesn't have an automatic signature mechanism, but it
is so configurable that there are a number of different ways
to implement one.  Check the periodic "MH Frequently Asked
Questions (FAQ) with Answers" posting for details.

=o= CAVEAT:  If you use the environment variable SIGNATURE to
point to your signature file, MH will use it not as a signature,
but as your "fullname".  Even worse, if your version of MH was
built with the "UCI" option and you *don't* use the environment
variable SIGNATURE to point to another file, MH will use the
$HOME/.signature file for this purpose!  To see if your version
of MH has this behavior, enter this command:

  % send -help

And look for the string "[UCI]" in the output.

=o= There's an Emacs interface to MH, called MH-E.  It has its
own signature mechanism, which is invoked with the "mh-insert-
signature" command (bound to the "C-c C-s" keys by default).

=o= This will insert the file $HOME/.signature file by default.
If your signature file has another name (e.g., to avoid its
being used by an MH build with the "UCI" option), you can set
the "mh-signature-file-name" variable to refer to a different
file.

Subject: ... ... 1.2.7 NN
Followup-To: news.software.nn

In addition to the basic signature instructions in 1.1 above, users of NN
need to edit their ~/.nn/init file so that it contains the following:

set query-signature off
set append-signature-mail on
set append-signature-post off

Note that the reason that you need to `set append-signature-post off' is
that the news posting software (usually inews) automatically appends
 ~/.signature if it exists.  If you `set append-signature-post on' then
both nn and inews append your sig and you'll send out two identical sigs
every time.

Followup-To: gnu.emacs.gnus

 (Does anyone know Mike Northam's current email address?)

In addition to the basic signature instructions in 1.1 above, users of GNUS
should verify that the value of the variable gnus-signature-file points to the
right place.  If you're in emacs, you can do so by evaluating the following
expression:
gnus-signature-file
                   ^ put your cursor here and type C-x C-e

You should see "~/.signature" in the echo area.  If not, edit your
$HOME/.emacs file and add the following:

(setq gnus-signature-file "~/.signature"))

Then load your $HOME/.emacs file or merely restart emacs and the variable
should be set correctly.

Subject: ... 1.3 Testing Your Signature 

After you've set everything up, use your mailer to mail a test message
to yourself, and your newsreader or news poster (such as nnpost or
Pnews) to post an article to a test newsgroup (use a local newsgroup
and Distribution set to `local' to save bandwidth).  Note that with
many newsreaders and mailers you will not see your signature while
you are composing a message - it will be automaticlally appended when
you send the message.  Note also that many systems add a line that
contains `-- ' to the top of your sig.  This is used by programs that
automatically deal with mail or news to identify the start of the
signature.

If you have a problem with your sig see the next section 1.4 on
Troubleshooting.

------------------------------

From: FAQ Editor <faq-editor@ii.com>
Subject: ... 1.4 Troubleshooting Your Signature 

On many systems your .signature (and .plan, .project, and .forward) needs 
to be world readable and your home directory needs to be world "executable"
(which means the world can go into that directory).  To check these
settings:

Type...          In order to...
-------          --------------
cd               Go to your home directory.

ls -l .filename  Check the permission: it should say -rw-r--r--
                 (Replace `.filename' with the appropriate file name.)

ls -ld .         Check permission of home dir: it should say drwx?-x?-x
                 The ?'s may be r's or hyphens or one of each (i.e.,
                 drwx--x--x, drwxr-xr-x, drwxr-x--x, drwx--xr-x are
                 each acceptable.)
If these aren't set correctly repeat the steps given in 1.1 above for
setting up your .signature.

If you are still having problems read the man pages for your newsreader,
news poster, or mailer and search for the string ``signature''.  There may 
be a variable you need to set in order for the ~/.signature to be appended.

Type...                 In order to...
-------                 --------------
man CommandName |less   Open man pages for CommandName (elm, pine, nn, tin
                        trn, Pnews, etc.) and pipe through less.  If your
                        system doesn't have less replace it with "more".

/signature              Search for first occurrence of "signature".

n                       Search for next occurrence of "signature".
                        Repeat the search until you find the appropriate
                        section of the manual.

u                       Page up half a screen. (This works in less but not in
                        more.)

[Space]                 Page down a screen. (This works in both less and more.)

Subject: 2.0 Finger

Finger is an Internet tool that you can use to find out information
about people all over the Net.  As long as a person's Internet host
is running the finger daemon (fingerd), you will be able to retrieve
information using the finger command.

This section tells you how to finger others, how to customize your
finger information, and how you may be able to track who fingers you
(and why finger tracking is probably not worth doing).

------------------------------

From: FAQ Editor <faq-editor@ii.com>
Subject: ... 2.1 How to Finger

This section describes how to finger using the Unix command line commands
or using a Web browser.

You can use finger to find out a person's full name, the shell they
use, and sometimes you can find out when the last time he or she was
logged in.

------------------------------

From: FAQ Editor <faq-editor@ii.com>
Subject: ... ... 2.1.1 Unix Finger Command

To finger someone

   finger UserID@fully.qualified.domain.name

On some systems finger is linked to f so the following also works:

   f UserID@fqdn


Finger displays different information on different systems.  Often it will 
display your full name, your default shell, when your were last logged on, 
and your ~/.plan and ~/.project files.

If you finger someone and the display takes more than one page you can pipe 
the output through less (or more if you don't have less).  For example to 
find out about Halcyon, my Internet service provider, type:

   finger info@halcyon.com |less


Finger can also be used to display information about groups of people.
For example:

   finger john@random.fqdn |less

Ths will display finger information about everyone with ``john'' in 
their name on random.fqdn.  You can get a short listing for each person
by using:

   finger -q john@random.fqdn |less


For technical details about the finger protocol see RFC1288.

Subject: ... ... 2.1.2 Using a Web Browser to Finger

In addition to using the finger or f command you can finger people
through a Web browser.  The following is a form that Doug Stevenson
<doug+@osu.edu> created:
  http://www-bprc.mps.ohio-state.edu/cgi-bin/finger.pl

You can finger a specific user with a syntax like this:
  http://www-bprc.mps.ohio-state.edu/cgi-bin/finger.pl?doug%2B@osu.edu

With Doug's finger gateway, if the .plan contains some HTML, it will be 
presented as hypertext, e.g:
 Go to <A HREF="http://www.jazzie.com/ii/">Infinite Ink's Home Page</A>.


Marc VanHeyningen <mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu> has a Web finger gateway that 
you can find out about at:
  http://www.cs.indiana.edu/finger/gateway

To use it you use this syntax:
  http://www.cs.indiana.edu/finger/fully.qualified.domain.name/userid/w

For example, to finger Marc, type:
  http://www.cs.indiana.edu/finger/cs.indiana.edu/mvanheyn/w

With Marc's finger gateway, if an URL in a .plan uses the <URL:...> syntax, 
described in 3.1 below, it will be a link, e.g.: <URL://www.jazzie.com/ii/>


You can also use this URL:
  gopher://fully.qualified.domain.name:79/0userid
                                          ^ Note: 0 precedes the userid

For example you can finger my Internet service provider with this URL:
  gopher://halcyon.com:79/0info

To finger yourself by type the following at your Unix prompt.

    finger YourUserID

For a different view of your finger information, and also to see
who else is currently logged in, type:

    finger

To ensure that people from other systems can finger you should ask someone 
who's not on your system to finger you too.  It is possible for you to
simulate fingering yourself from another machine (another.fqdn) by doing 
this:

    finger YourUserID@your.fqdn@another.fqdn

In order for this to work another.fqdn must support full finger functionality.

On most systems you can change the information that people see when
they finger you.

------------------------------

From: FAQ Editor <faq-editor@ii.com>
Subject: ... ... 2.2.1 Using chfn to change your full name (and more)

On many Unix systems you can change some of your default information,
such as your full name, by typing the following at your Unix prompt:

   chfn

If chfn is not available try "passwd -f".  If neither of these are
available then you will need to contact your system administrator and
ask him/her to change your full name, etc.

After you have changed your information check that they are in place
by fingering yourself.  Also to see a different display of your

   finger

This displays a one line description of everyone currently logged on
your system.

Subject: ... ... 2.2.2 Creating Your .plan and .project files

Your ~/.project and ~/.plan files, if they exist, are displayed when you
are fingered.  Setting these up is essentially the same as setting
up a ~/.signature file (described in 1.0 above).

Type...                 In order to...
-------                 --------------
cd                      Change to your home directory.

                        (Replace "pico" with another editor if you like.)

chmod 644 .plan         Make .plan readable by all.

chmod a+x .             Make home directory searchable by all.

If you want a .project file follow the same procedure.  Note that only the
first line of the .project is displayed (so you might as well only make
it one line!).

If you have problems, see section 1.4 on "Troubleshooting Your
Signature" to make sure that your permissions are set correctly.

Subject: ... 2.3 Finding Out Who Fingers You

Finger wasn't designed to log finger requests, so finding who fingers
you is complicated - and sometimes impossible - to setup.  For more
information see:

* The next section of this FAQ on the Backfinger Script.

* Chris Alfeld's fingertrace: 
     http://www.math.utah.edu/~calfeld/fingertrace/

* R.L. Samuell's logfinger script, which you can obtain by fingering:

  This article is archived in all the usual FAQ archives, including:
  http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/unix-faq/faq/part4/faq-doc-9.html


An easy thing that you can do to see if anyone has fingered you is type the 
following at your Unix prompt:

  ls -lu $HOME/.plan

This tells you the last time someone accessed your .plan, but it doesn't
tell you who it was.  I have this in my .login because it's interesting to
see when the last time someone was checking on me!

[Note that under AFS (Andrew File System, a distributed filesystem),
 ls -lu $HOME/.plan will not work due to the fact that AFS has no 
 notion of ``atime'', or ``last accessed time''.]

------------------------------

From: Janet Rosenbaum <jerosenb@fas.harvard.edu>
Subject: ... ... 2.3.1 Backfinger Script

A script called, among other things, backfinger, planner, and
finger_logger (flogger or frogger, for short), makes your .plan into
a named pipe. Think of a named pipe as being a sort of pipe used with
plumbing that opens on the screen of the person who is fingering you
- say, Fred - so that when the .plan file (a named pipe) is accessed,
it looks for a program from which to get something to stick on Fred's
screen. The script is called when you are fingered. At that moment,
the script looks to the finger port of your UNIX machine, sees which
machine Fred is on, and logs that machine's IP number and host name.
The script then can execute a command to spit out a .plan on Fred's
screen.  You could use a program that generates random poetry, the
fortune program, or simply "cat plan_file" to make the contents of
the text file (plan_file) appear on Fred's screen.  To make Fred
think that you are really cool, the script also tells him what
machine he is fingering you from.

This script tells you only the machine that Fred is fingering you
from, not his actual user name. Although the identification protocol
(documented in RFC1413) allows exchange of the user name that
initiated the finger process over port 113, the current backfinger
program does not use it. (Anyone who has enough time to add this
feature certainly may, though!) The other way to find out Fred's name
is to use systat, which requests a list of current processes on
Fred's machine over port 11. This option rarely is available, due to
security concerns.  

Following are two caveats:

 * This program must be running at all times on your system, even
   when you are logged out. Leaving on a background process like this
   one annoys most system administrators no end, especially on
   high-load systems. Do not run the program unless you are sure that
   you are allowed to run background processes.

 * If you decide that you want to stop running this program, remove
   your .plan file as soon as you kill the process; otherwise, all
   your finger processes will hang.

Given these caveats, the script is distributed only to those who can
use it, mostly for educational reasons. The Web site is
http://pubweb.acns.nwu.edu/~jrosen/scripts/logger.src.

Note: I am not the author of this program; the version that I
distribute is virtually identical to the program distributed by Steve
Franklin. The real author is Tony Rems (rembo@unisoft.com).

Subject: 3.0 What to Put in Your Signature and Finger Files

It is good netiquette to keep your signature to four lines or fewer.
And many news posters, such as some versions of inews(1), will not
post an article that has a signature with more than four lines in
it.  So, put large large pictures, your philosophy of life , etc. in
your finger files or in your Web pages and point people to those in
your signature.

For signatures it's a good idea to keep the width less than 75
characters so that if your signature is included in a followup
preceded by an attribution character (like `> '), each line will
still be on one line.

A good strategy is to keep your signature short and include an

that will finger you, e.g.:

you through a Web gateway such as the ones described in 2.1 above, these

Dotplan is a program that performs "animation" effects on text
strings, so that .plan files (hence the name) look a little more
fancy (on low-speed dialup lines).  Some of the effects make the
characters appear one at a time; others have the characters
appear at once and "move" around.

Subject: ... 3.4 Robot Fodder

Q: Tim, why do you and others put random, provocative words like
   the following in your sig?

    -- 
    Green Card fodder: Canter, Siegel, green card, Joel Furr, liable,
    fortune, conspiracy, CyberSell, Tennessee Bar.


A: The original genesis of this bit of lore was the NSA's
   supposed archiving of Usenet.  It's a popular urban legend
   that the NSA scans and archives every message posted to
   Usenet, and in the heyday of this story it was popular to
   add "spook fodder" to your .signature consisting of words
   like "conspiracy, bullion, plutonium, Saudi Arabia,
   president, assassination," and so on.  I think that the GNU
   Emacs distribution still comes with the code that would
   insert such words into your posts or .signatures
   automatically.
   
   A couple of years ago there was a nut named Clayton Cramer
   who would periodically bombard soc.motss with pages and
   pages of pseudo-scientific babble about the evils of
   homosexuality.  It got so tiring that after a while I
   amended my .signature to read "Clayton-Fodder:
   homosexuality, pedophilia, incest, guns, Second Amendment,
   Libertarian, Reagan," or some such.  It got quite a few
   giggles from some of the old hands out there.
   
   A more recent example was the case of "Serdar Argic," a
   program written by a U of Minnesota student to search for
   any article referencing Turkey or Turkish culture, and
   follow up with several pages of invective about Armenian
   genocide.  There were some reports that this program was
   faulty and began responding to articles about "Thanksgiving
   Turkey" and the like, but I don't recall ever seeing that
   happen, myself.  Nevertheless, people started putting "Argic
   fodder" into their .signatures, like "Turkey, Armenia, SDPA
   crooks, genocide" in order to bait the "Argic-bot" into
   following up.
   
   The latest rumor is that Canter and Siegel are archiving
   every post which refers to them, in the hopes of finding
   grounds for a libel suit.  Hence, my .signature (which only
   goes to newsgroups in the news.* hierarchy).  It's a
   ridiculous idea, but this is one of those bits of folklore
   which I really enjoy perpetuating.

Subject: 4.0 Customized Headers

Another way that you can tell people about yourself, or your company, is
to customize the headers that are sent in your mail and news messages.
Mail headers are specified in RFC822 and news headers are specified in
RFC1036.  The headers that you are most likely to want to customize
are the From, Reply-To, and Organization headers.  

READING MESSAGES
================
Most mailers and newsreaders do not display all the headers when you
are reading a message you've received.  Often typing `h' or ^h (for
header) will display all the headers of a message.  You can often set
up your mailer or newsreader to always automatically display whatever
headers you specify.


COMPOSING MESSAGES
==================
The sections below give instructions for automatically having
customized headers included in your messages.  Some composers will
automatically display your customized headers while you are
composing, and others won't.

------------------------------

From: FAQ Editor <faq-editor@ii.com>
Subject: ... 4.1 Your From Header
Followup-To: news.newusers.questions

Your From header is the main thing that people use to find out who you
are.  You can use either of the following formats for your From
header:

 From: Full Name <userid@fully.qualified.domain.name>
 From: userid@fully.qualified.domain.name (Full Name)

For example, I can use either of these:

 From: Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
 From: nancym@ii.com (Nancy McGough)

The first format is preferred.

Your userid is usually your login name and can not easily be changed.  
Your fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is the domain name used by your 
Internet provider.  If you have a choice of FQDNs to use, I recommend 
using the shortest one.  For example, at one of my providers I can use 
either nancym@coho.halcyon.com or nancym@halcyon.com.  I like the second 
one because it is shorter and easier for people to type and remember.

Your full name is usually in the file /etc/passwd and is the name that
people see when they finger you.  On many systems you can change your
full name using the chfn command, which was described in section 2.2.1
above.

Some newsreaders and mailers allow you to customize your From line
using commands specific to that tool.  If you do this be aware of a
these important points:

 * Customizing your From header will not hide your identity since the
   transport agent will append a header, such as the Sender header,
   that includes your real identity.

 * In some newsreaders you will not be able to cancel an article that
   you posted using a customized From header.

Subject: ... 4.2 Specific Mailer and Newsreader Instructions
Followup-To: news.newusers.questions

Below are instructions for customizing your headers in different
mailers and newsreaders.  If you have a choice between a couple
methods, it's usually a good strategy to use a method that works for
many different tools.  For example, setting an environment variable.

------------------------------

From: FAQ Editor <faq-editor@ii.com>
Subject: ... ... 4.2.1 Tin and the RN Family
Followup-To: news.software.readers

In tin and the rn family of tools (Pnews, rn, trn, strn) you can use
environment variables to customize your headers.  These newsreaders
use the FROM, REPLYTO, and ORGANIZATION environment variables, if
they are set, to determine the From, Reply-To, and Organization headers.

The way you set an environment variable depends on which shell you
are using. For example, in the csh or tcsh you can set the
ORGANIZATION variable by putting the following line in you ~/.login:

  setenv ORGANIZATION "Your Organization Name"

After you edit your ~/.login you can establish the setting by either logging
out and loggin back in or by typing the following at your Unix prompt:

  source ~/.login

To check that the variable is set type:

  printenv

After you have set your environment variables, post a test message to
a local test newsgroup with `local' distribution to check that the
headers are correct.

Followup-To: comp.mail.pine

In Pine 3.90, and later versions, you customize your headers using
the customized-hdrs variable.  Here are instructions for setting your
Organization header.

1. From the Main Menu type S for Setup
2. Type C for Configuration
3. To change the value of the customized-hdrs variable:
   a) Space bar and arrow down to the customized-hdrs variable.
   b) Type A for Add Value
   c) At the prompt type: 

          Organization: Your Organization Name

      If you have set the ORGANIZATION environment variable
      (which is described in 4.2.1 above) you can type: 

          Organization: $ORGANIZATION


While reading a message that you've received you can view all the
headers of the message by typing H.  If H does not work you need to
go to your configuration menu and set the enable-full-header-cmd
variable.

While composing a message you can view all the headers by placing the cursor
in the header region and typing ^R (view rich headers).

NN uses its news-header and mail-header variables to set headers for
news and mail messages you send.  For example, to set your
Organization header, put the following lines in your ~/.nn/init file:

set news-header Organization: Your Organization Name
set mail-header Organization: Your Organization Name


While reading messages with NN you can view the Organization line
by adding O (the letter "oh") to your header-lines variable setting.
I like the following setting:

set header-lines AFOnWK*Y

	Well, you are right.  It is not impossible.  (I'd looked at the
source for pine, older version, and missed the makefile.msc file used
in that version.)  However, most mortals (at least the ones I know) don't
have C compilers on their PCs nor do they have access to the tools 
necessary to add support for the various IP stacks.  Most users of PCs
tend to use applications out of the box.

I realise there is another thread along similar lines, however I seem to
have missed the start of it. 

Can anyone tell me if there is a way to attach a random signature to the
end of any mail I send in pine v3.07. In tin (which I use for reading
news) I can assign a directory for signatures and it will select a random
file from that directory for my signature. Can a similar thing be done in
pine, preferably using the same directory?

Thankyou for any help.

And a year or so back when we added news support, we observed that 
"Program for Internet News and Email" might be a better interpretation...  
But mostly it's the name of a nice tree family.

Well, no, neither we nor our documentation ever said that.  In fact the
users we were working with were very happy with their mailer... it's just
that we didn't want to keep running MVS to support it. We did say that the
currently-available Unix mailer options did not meet our ease-of-use 
requirements.

If you mean automatic MIME labelling of wordperfect files, this is not 
yet supported.  In 3.92 there will be support for a .mimetypes file that 
can be used to map file extensions to MIME types when attaching files.

Still it should certainly be possible to send wordperfect files via Pine 
and save them on the destination computer.  They won't be labeled as 
wordperfect files, but the bits should arrive intact.  (They'll be 
labeled application/octet-stream).

   I have mail coming into a system that only can act as a POP server ...

   Can (and if so, how) Pine access this or am I going to need to forward
   the mail to my local account??

Does anyone know how I can change the from field when I send mail out? We 
have a system where the same id seems to be put on all of our outgoing ID 
even though we have different ids for logging in and sending out mail.

thanks,

Message-Id: <MAS8Y.95Apr27132053@holmes.acc.virginia.edu>
Date: Thu, 27 Apr 1995 17:20:53 GMT

Hi,
  I sent this to the pine-bugs address, but the handy auto-reply
suggested I post here for a speedier response (maybe).   

I have the following problem with 3.90 running on an RS/6000 (AIX 3.2):

If I am in Pine and my INBOX is empty, when a new message arrives I get 
the error:
   [Mailbox open failed, aborted: Is a directory]

When I exit, I get a core dump:

   Bug in Pine detected: "Received abort signal".
  Exiting pine.
   IOT/Abort trap(coredump)

/usr/spool/mail/mas8y has the proper permissions when this happens

When I go back into Pine, pine can read the INBOX with no problem.

I added the following features recently (in the past day or so):
       select-without-confirm,
       enable-aggregate-command-set,
       enable-flag-cmd,
       show-selected-in-boldface
However, when I went back to my original configuration, I still had
the same problem.

I also had just cleaned out my INBOX in the past day or so and just 
started noticing the problem.

                                         Thanks for any help,
                                         Melanie

Message-Id: <Pine.SGI.3.91.950427170918.7828A-100000@gauss.eng.ohio-state.edu>


Is there any way to get the '+' sign to appear in front mail that you 
receive that is to an alternate address?

I have my mail forwarding from other places.
I also subscribe to several mailing lists.

It would be nice if I could somehow get it to put the plus in front
of _all_ the mail that is specifically to me...not just specifically to 
the address I am checking?

Is this possible?  If not, could it be in the 3.92? (Or is it more 
trouble than it's worth?)

Thanks...

I've installed Pine version 3.89 on a AIX 4.1.1 and I can't seem to turn 
off debug.  Debug files are generated in users directories.  Any 
suggestions?

Thank you..

I am trying to send a mail message to about 50 people. I know I can do 
this by creating the file withe users names in it, but I don't want one 
users to see the list of all 50 people. I have tried to use bcc but it still
doesn't work. Is this a limitaion of pine or am I over looking something.

A user was kicked out of PINE after she answered "y" to the question 
"Continue postponed composition ...?"

Checking the user's (shd) top directory, I found the following files.

Once these files were removed, the problem disappeared.  The user is 
using Pine 3.91 on an AIX machine.  Has anyone had this problem?

Is there any way to automate the insertion of subject lines as one can do 
with email addresses? It would be a convenient feature.

The only atob decoder I know of is atob v1.1 and the zipped file can
commonly be found by the name 'atob11.zip'.  I have a question about
how to "unchunk" btoa encoded files because they are usually sent in
64k packets.

Subject: 3.90 startup buglet

Message-Id: <3np1ql$dc3@ccshst05.cs.uoguelph.ca>

Sometimes pine 3.90 loops (actually repeatedly segmentation faults) when
started up from an rlogin session to a NetBSD 1.0 system. The problem is
that init_signals() is called before config_screen() in pine/pine.c and if
a SIGWINCH is posted between the two calls, the ttyo pointer isn't set up.\

Although there are several ways to fix this, the following one line change
does the trick. (I couldn't see a bugs email address in the doc, so I am
posting it here...)

WRONG.  WRONG.  WRONG.  How many times must we rehash this?  The -w option
turns off "word wrap," which automatically moves words to the next line
when you reach the end of a line.  That has nothing to do with "long lines
wrapped," which occurs only when reading in a file.  Read in a file with
lines longer than 255 characters (e.g. .newsrc) and you'll see the
problem.

Mine only gets marked as Deleted if I save the file into a folder, or
delete it myself.  Otherwise, it's left in the INBOX with no letters in front 
(meaning it's been read). I'm using unix pine by the way.

Is there a switch to get PINE into scroll mode

What is the best way to get PINE mail
read to disk from a dial up connection to
an IBM style personal computer?

Would Q-modem expedite this process?

advise, ok?  :-)

The multiple-@ syntax of RFC-733 has been banned on the Internet since the
early 1980s.  I should know, since it was my mailer's first widespread use
of this syntax on the net triggered the ban!  Something about a certain
MUA from a well-known government contractor, used by high-level military
and government brass, crashing when it saw those things and smashing the
mailbox file with it... 

RFC-822 formalized the ban in 1982, more than 7 years before Pine was
written.  RFC-822 offers a mechanism of source routing via this syntax:
	<@machine2:user@machine1>
but this syntax has been depreciated in favor of moving routing to the 
domain name system via MX records.

The only practical means of doing source routing these days is a
convention known as the "%-hack" [which I popularized in the wake of the
above-mentioned ban, causing a different crisis...but that's another
story!].

The %-hack works by treating the rightmost-% in a local mailbox as an @. 
On the originating end, all by the rightmost-@ is changed to an %.  In
other words, you would use the syntax:
	user%machine1@machine2
This is interpreted by the sender as mailbox "user%machine1" at 
"machine2", by machine2 as mailbox "user" at "machine1", and finally by 
machine1 as local mailbox "user".

I don't believe that there is any scenario that Pine would be changed to
support a syntax that has been rejected as a great evil for 15 years. 

I hope that the %-hack will solve your problem satisfactorily; if not,
could you explain a bit more about your configuration?  There should be 
some other way to address this problem.

	Can this be done in Pine?

Pine is an Internet mailer, not an X.400 mailer, but I have seen people
use something like "x400_address@gateway.domain"...

Pine assumes that if you sent the message, it is more useful to show who
you sent it to, particularly in the sent-mail folder where this occurs
most frequently...

Justin,

When you use Bcc:, make sure you have some entry in the To: or sendmail 
may add Apparently-To: headers.  One possibility is something like:

	To: Blind to all recipients:;

The ":;" effectively makes the line a comment, but it satisfies most
sendmails...

Signal handling is better in Pine 3.91 and will be cleaned up much more in
Pine 3.92...

When I print in Windows, I get condensed print (132 columns, about 100 lines 
per page).  This is unacceptable and unreadable.

How do I change this to a more standard printout of 80 columns and 60 
lines per page?

I tried Setup|Printer from the Main Menu, but the program responds with 
nothing but a short pause.

I am running Windows for Workgroups 3.11 with an HP LaserJet IIIp, all 
properly configured.  I am using Pine 3.91, downloaded about 4 weeks ago.

Thank you in advance,

If I "Goto" a newsgroup that I have not previously subscribed to, Pine 
3.91 will automatically subscribe me to it, and will add it to my .newsrc 
file.  The only problem is, it doesn't do it correctly.

The line that gets written to the .newsrc file has an extra character 
(hex FF) before the name of the group, and is missing the newline 
character after the list of article numbers.

seems like every time I post something thru pine 3.91 
the organization field in the display is replaced by
"Fuzzy at Misconfigured News Reader"

wondered where we have to set the value for pine to find it.
tin 1.22 finds it in environment variable ORGANIZATION which
I set in /etc/csh.cshrc and /etc/profile for the various shells.

thnaks in advance....

How can I configure my 'pinerc' file so that when i start pine it prompts 
my for my personal name, or user name?  I've seen this done before, so I 
imagine it is possible.

Thanks.

I agree with John's Suggestion. It is very not to be able to change the print
command on the fly. I usually filter my printing through a postscript
formatter, sometimes, I would like to print the file differently. No easy way
now.

Hello,

I am asking this question on behalf of one of our users.
I have looked through the documentation and the FAQ but can't
find an explanation.

In the "sent" folder,  what does the "n" mean on a message?
The status of these never seems to change, even if the user
reads them... 

Any ideas appreciated.
Thanks,
--Rich

Pardon if this is a dumb question, but I hope someone can help me!

I just ftp'd Pine and it seems to be for network users only.  Is this the
case?  I'm trying to get it to work on my PC at home, so I can use it with
my commercial provider, but I can't seem to get the pctcp.ini information
that I need, and the docs lead to me to believe that I'm expected to be on
a network.  (I'm not even really sure what pctcp means!)

Any help would be appreciated!

Thanks,

Andrew

	Also, if the local sendmail is part of an X.400 gateway implementation
it can handle:

At the University of Oregon, the only way anyone knows who to print from 
pine is by useing the printer at the computing center, or by saving it 
onto our account and pulling it off as a text file through another 
program.  Is there any way to set up which printer pine will print to?  
All our printer (most) our connected to each other in one way or another.

Hi Isaac,
I got this from pine most frequent asked questions:

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is Pine?

Pine(tm) --a Program for Internet News & Email-- is a tool for reading,
sending, and managing electronic messages.  It was designed specifically
with novice computer users in mind, but can be tailored to accommodate the
needs of power users as well.  Pine uses Internet message protocols
(e.g. RFC822, SMTP, MIME, IMAP, and NNTP) and runs on Unix, MS-DOS, and
MS Windows. 
  
The guiding principles for Pine's user-interface were:  careful limitation
of features, one-character mnemonic commands, always-present command
menus, immediate user feedback, and high tolerance for user mistakes.  It
is intended that Pine can be learned by exploration rather than reading
manuals.  It has the ability to perform full screen editing of messages,
include and extract attachments (such as Word or Excel files), and other
advanced message system features. 

Pine uses IMAP for accessing message folders on remote computers and MIME
for sending multimedia or other binary files as attachments to normal
messages. 

P.s. Can you help me out with finding a better speller for pine than the unix
     speller, I will really appreciate that.

How about leaving the file the way it is?  I guess you've never seen
program source code or dot files where the location of line breaks is
significant.  You can't just insert newlines willynilly.  Pico's flaw,
to put a fine point on it, is breaking long lines without any warning
to the user.

Take a look at a .newsrc file that has been maintained by trn for a
while.  Each newsgroup gets one line with a list of article numbers
that have been marked read (or "deleted" in pine's language).  Some
such lines are long strings of numbers, because the user has skipped
around and read articles here and there.  Lines longer than some
limit-- is it 256 characters perhaps?-- will be split by pico as it
reads in the file, with no comment on screen.  This makes the file
unusable by trn, since it is supposed to have one line per newsgroup.
Strangely, if you happen to notice what happened, and delete the
unwanted newlines, pico can do it, and when you write the file back to
disk, pico can do it.  It just can't read such long lines from disk.
That's a bug.

Does anyone now if PC pine (packet driver version) uses EMS or XMS and=20

Today I was not able to reply to a message 830 bytes long. Pine doesn't=20
finish its work in this case but doesn't allow me to do the required=20

3) Why I could not ryply although I could report a bug using a much=20

Could anyone tell me how to make pine longer in row?  Right now it's

That's fun.  Versions before 3.91 can't handle news, if I'm not mistaken.

Well, I'm new at this game but I do know how to force a check (at least it

ctrl+l any new items are instantly added to your box.
Hope this helps. As for ignoring the interval...no idea...can anyone else

The wattcp.cfg file is not needed for the *windows* version of pc-pine. 
PC-Pine for Windows does not use Waterloo TCP; it uses your 
favorite Winsock/TCP-IP stack.

I realize I'm not the first person to ask this, but how do I send a 
single message to more than one person.  I heard talk about setting up a 
separate file to handle the names.  How can I do that?  And can I simply 
type all addresses in the "TO:" line?

You've already had the format identified for you so I'll get direct to how
to possibly convert it.

Since I assume you are either a Shell-Only user and/or use a PC as opposed
to a Macintosh as your computer, thus the following will be of limited use
to you (although it could be useful to Macintosh owning lurkers who need to
handle AtoB/BtoA. StuffIt Deluxe (one of the Major Macintosh Archiving
Programs [it is the one that generates SIT files]) comes with a number of
Translators - One of these is AtoB/BtoA. Thus this program is your solution
to converting the file via a Macintosh Program. There should be (I think)
MS-DOS and UNIX AtoB (ASCII to Binary) Utilities in the respective Internet
Archive Sites but I am not going to state this with 100% certainty. A quick
Archie [?] with the keyword of AtoB  (and/or BtoA) should locate them.

Hi Pine Developers & users

I guess Pine first of all is a mail-program, so maybe you do not accept
the following as a bug, but if Pine should be used as a news-tool, support
for the correct news-headers should also be included. 

Our problem is that we want a 'Organization'-header in our news-postings 
with a default value (name of our University). Doing that also makes the 
'Organization'-header occur in normal mails, where the header do not belong.

I therefore suggest, that new versions of Pine will exclude headers in 
normal mails that do not belong there.

If this is already possible, I have not been able to find out how, and 
I'm sorry to have bothered you. I would however like to know if possible  
how it is done, or if pine will support this in the future.

Regards from Finn in Denmark

Mime-Version: 1.0

Some of the listservs I subscribe to have addresses consisting of a 
descriptive phrase followed by the actual address.  When I wan to reply  
or send to such a list, the whole address doesn't fit on one line, so I 
either have to delete the first part or the message doesn't get sent.  
Can anyone help?

Subject: Missing Date: line handled ungracefully?
Date: 28 Apr 1995 17:54:25 -0600
Message-Id: <3nrv7h$rh3@cibnor.cibnor.conacyt.mx>

Hi, folks--

We have an interesting situation using Eudora which sends its messages
out via an SMTP server here.  Appears that Eudora doesn't generate a
separate Date: line in the message, and the SMTP server doesn't fill
in that gap.  So we have messages floating around without Date: lines,
and Pine doesn't know how to date them.  The date info is THERE, in one
of the other lines, and is found by our standard Unix mail program
which handles the "dateless" messages with aplomb-- SURELY Pine is
smarter than mail...? ;>

Before I dig into the code, is there any way to configure Pine to do 
this, or is this patch material?

Thanks--

 seems like every time I post something thru pine 3.91 
 the organization header is replaced by:

 "Misconfigured client newsreader"
 
 wondered where we have to set the value for pine to find it.
 tin 1.22 finds it in environment variable ORGANIZATION which
 I set in /etc/csh.cshrc and /etc/profile for the various shells.
 
 any ideas would be very much appreciated.

 thanks in advance....

Open up Tin and look at the starting up lines. It should tell you what 
news server you are accessing. Then go into configuration and add value 
of what you found under nntp

As far as I am aware, you can accomplish this using two methods.  Yes, you
can send to multiple recipients in the TO: field by using a comma separator. 
Also, you can set up a mailing list in the address book, using a name for
the list eg 'friends'.

	I have found a BTOA.ZIP and an ATOB.ZIP on ftp sites.  The former 
contains C versions of both BTOA.COM and ATOB.COM.   The latter contains 
a much smaller assembly-language ATOB.EXE without a corresponding btoa.  
I tried btoa, mime and uuencode on a 520 kb .ZIP file with the following 
size ASCII-encoded files resulting:

btoa		666 kb
mime		713 kb
uuencode	728 kb

	It's clear that the btoa method gives the most compact results.  
Why is btoa not more widely used?

This is not the problem. Whether you have word wrap turned on or off, 
Pico still splits lines longer than about 250 characters when it reads in 
a file. Note that you can still enter a 250+ character line while 
editing, just that it can't load them in.

Why does thsi matter? Well, appart from being rather a strange 
limitation, the main problem comes from the "References:" header which 
can get to quite a size when following up to articles in a long thread. 
If it gets split, then newsreaders get all confused and half your header 
ends up in your article. Not very desirable.

I have seen about/heard about several scripts to PGP-sign a message that
was written in pine, but I was wondering if this is another thing that
might be included in the next release of pine or not.

One other small thing about pico:  It would be nice if I can change the
point of word wrap on the fly... instead of automagically being -3 chars
from the right edge (or whatever it is) I can set it to column X, or
even maybe column 0 if I don't even want to wrap at all...

*shrug*  just some thoughts...

I just made the switch from elm to pine 3.91.  I love it.  However when I 
use pine I seem to loose my connection every so often.  ie NO CARRIER.

I have an alias set up in my .login file to access pine in the nuglops 
directory.  Could this be the problem?  Would it be better to set my own 
copy of pine in my home directory?   Any insight would be greatly 
appreciated.  Why hasn't netcom just updated thier version of pine?

I am configuring Pine 3.91 for several different types of Unix systems in
our department.  Because we discourage the use of directories in the
/usr/local/ hierarchy, I would like to keep the global configuration file
in a location other than /usr/local/lib/pine.conf.  I had hoped that 
there would be a variable in the makefile to set this but I can't see 
one.  In fact, a grep of the source code directory seems to indicate that 
the name /usr/local/lib/pine.conf occurs as exactly that string in a 
number of locations in the source code and the help files.

Is it the case that using another global configuration file would require 
replacing that string in many different source files?  (Replies via 
e-mail would be appreciated.  I don't know that I will be able to keep up 
with the volume of traffic on this group.)

If that is the case, may I suggest that allowing easy reconfiguration of 
that name could be something to add to the "TO DO" list?

I have been using the usual suggested methed for resending a message. ie
saving to postponed-msgs and then compose. 

I have noticed the following:

I want to re-send a message.

Go to sent-mail
pick up message
Save to postponed-msgs    (  message in sent-mail is marked deleted)
Compose
Send message

Message is NOT saved to sent-mail - if you forget to toggle the delete flag
you've lost it.

Comments???

I believe in the first row, that's because btoa uses a set of 85  
characters which is known not to be safe in any case to pass through every  
existing mail transfer mechanism. Some of the characters may become  
changed or lines could get corrupted.

Mime, that is, base64, uses a set of characters which is known to be safe  
in nearly every case. From RFC 1521:

-------------------- 8< --- cut here ---------------------------
      NOTE: This subset has the important property that it is
      represented identically in all versions of ISO 646, including US
      ASCII, and all characters in the subset are also represented
      identically in all versions of EBCDIC.  Other popular encodings,
      such as the encoding used by the uuencode utility and the base85
      encoding specified as part of Level 2 PostScript, do not share
      these properties, and thus do not fulfill the portability
      requirements a binary transport encoding for mail must meet.

I know of at least two "VMS versions" of PINE.  One is part of the
PMDF package, available commercially.
 
The one I can tell you more about is a freeware ported version done at
Hebrew Univ of Jerusalem (HUJI), you can read my notes on installing
this version onto our group's VMS systems -
 
http://d1.ph.gla.ac.uk/%7Eflavell/vms-pine.html
 
and, yes, the source code is available from directory LOCAL at
vms.huji.ac.il (userid "anonymous" - _not_ "ftp").

Try converting the WP file to ASCII text (do the conversion in wp, pine

When I use mailx, my FROM: address is shannona@htc8500.com which is correct.
However, when using Pine, my FROM: is htc8500!shannona - what gives?
I assume this is a configuration issue.  Please help.  All of my
mail is bouncing when someone replies to me.

see post wed 4-26 under thread 'Another .sig qestion!!!' by me.
I will mail this and a copy of that to David.
Anyone else can't find it, gimme a holler.
Don't know if ya'll can use the same directory, but you can copy (not 
move) them into yer home directory, rename them, save them, use them as 
per previous article.  Hope this helps.   BYE.

I think in future versions of Pine it should be possible to $ort on the 
basis of who or what messages are sent To:. That would be convenient.

Is there a way to either institute much longer update intervals for open 
folders, or turn off updating-to-disk? I occasionally read mail in large 
folders, and find the periodic delays to be unnecessary and very time- 
consuming. Usually I do want frequent updating however.

I strongly dislike having Pine ask me if I would like to zap old 
sent-mail folders. I could accidentally hit 'y' and loose tons of mail. I 
would really like to see a way to turn that feature off as it is 
extremely dangerous.

Subject: Pico & control chars..

Message-Id: <3nu9f0$524@rosebud.sdsc.edu>

Any chance that pico will allow you to insert control charactes into a
text file ever? :-)

My only other "complaint" about pico is the lack of "search for regex" or
at least case-sensitive serach...

Also, is there any projected (expected) release date for pine 3.92?  And
what new features can we expect in it?

Thanks.
