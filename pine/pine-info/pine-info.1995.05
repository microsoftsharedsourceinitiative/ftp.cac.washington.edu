: I agree with the last poster (Leng) that Pine does NOT mark read mail as
: Deleted - there is no option to set it up that way either.

Incorrect answer. Zero points

In the .pinerc file there is a flag that you can set to make it do either.
If you enter a folder name after read-message-folder=
it will save all read mail to this folder marking it deleted in the inbox.
Having this option set means the only mail in the inbox is the unread.

least in 3.91)

	I would like to compile PINE on this old steel monster of mine,
a Sun 2/120 with SunOS 3.5.  No, I don't want v4.1.1 on it...it would be
slower yet (if that were possible).  Has anyone done this?  What do I need
to mess with?  I am not really a programmer (it gives me hives) so 
perhaps there is something easy that I missed, but I certainly have missed
it.

changes. 

Not only that, but I don't have any authority to do anything on their

Last week there was a posting re: selecting printers on the fly.  It 
seems to me that Pine was 'meant' to allow this, since when you initiate 
the print command, you are asked "Print to lpr?"  and offered Yes, No, or 
Cancel as options.  Since C is cancel, N should logically mean, "Well, 
then, where *do* you want to print?" and let the user fill in the 
destination.

My $.02 worth.

Why don't you just use the forward or bounce command?  I think that 
when you forward a message it will automatically get saved in your
default save file but when you bounce a msg it isn't saved.

Hi,

Is there a way to configure pine not to use MIME format for sending attachment

Please help and send me responses at rngu@scdt.intel.com since I do not read

Thanks in advance,

This has been the standard behaviour all along. You have remember to 
insert the FCC field. Tis is presumablybecause messages as sent do not 
have an Fcc: field. 

It sure would be nice to get the standard default put in tho!

Sorry I was forgetting the confirmation bit. I have all confirmation
turned off in my .pinerc file. By setting a read-mail folder in .pinerc
all read mail is auto saved to read-mail and deleted from the inbox. If I
don't set it all read-mail stays in the inbox until deleted and or saved.

~~~~~~~~~~~~Affirmative to the forward being automatically saved. You 
have me wondering though about the "bounce" function - I didn't know one 
could bounce individual msgs.  Please tell me how!

Someone mailed me that this is only possible in nn 6.5 if this feature
was switched on at compile time.  Pine 3.90 (and higher versions),
which is both a mailer and newsreader, has full text searching of a
newsgroup or mail folder.  To do this you first need to set the
enable-aggregate-command-set and then while viewing the newsgroup type:

  ; t a TextToSearchFor

Which means select (;) text (t) all messages (a).

Hope this helps,
Nancy

Yay!  The Pine development group has been incredible with their work on 
this version.  Every single minor new feature orbug fix I've been asking 
for is supposed to be in it.  Great work, guys!

Now, as long as I'm here, I'll add another request for a minor new 
feature...no new bugs in 3.92? ;)

I am having trouble building Pine under Solaris for Intel 2.4. When I
try to compile it, I get a ton of warnings about conflicting type
definitions for strcmp, strcpy, memcmp and memcpy, and the compile
eventually dies without producing any binaries. If someone could
either give me some pointers, or email me the binaries (for pine and
pico) for Solaris x86, either would be appreciated. Also, in case it
matters, I am using GCC 2.6.3, and it was installed according to the
directions (and has compiled other stuff with no problem). I do not
have the SUNWspro compilers on this system.

Thanks,

Do you have shell access to the machine that stores your mail folders?
If so, just set things up in the usual way and the filtered folders
will show up in your Pine folder list.  I've set a lot of people up
with PC-Pine to IMAP to access procmail-filtered folders on a Unix host.

I recently started using pine on Linux 1.2.1. Altough I like it,
there is one thing I can't figure out.
How to change the left-hand side from my <From:> header.
It's possible to set another domainname, so why isn't it possible
to set another username.
The only solution I could find is to add a user with the desired 
username to my system and start pine beeing that user.
Can anybody help me :-(

Better than Pine?  I'm writing a filtering agent.  Since Pine isn't a 
filtering agent, how can any given filtering agent be "better than Pine"?

Thanks, but you're just lucky.  Not everyone's feature requests (not even 
most of ours) will make it in.

3.92 is turning out to be chock-full o' code changes so it is probably
going to be more Beta-ey than 3.91 when it is first released.  (That word I 
just made up is pronounced BAY TAH EEE and it means it probably won't work
quite right for everyone. :-)

Heres a suggestion for printers,
instead of just locking in a single configuration how about during
the print command allowing for an option to modify the current print
command.
So that if it comes up with     lpr -Pprinter
the options are yes no and modify, and selecting modify allows you to
change the name of the printer for this message.

I would like to use pine under linux and under DOS, using the same local
message folders under both OS. I have set up pine under linux to access the
folders on my DOS-partition. Now, the problem is that every time pine accesses
a folder on this partition it tries to create a lockfile by appending .lock to
the folder name. Since this is not possible on a DOS partition, pine just hangs
for a few minutes and then gives a message like "cannot create lockfile ...".

Is there a possibility to either change the format of the lockfiles or to
disable lockfiles completely?

Thanks for any info,

Anyone out there who knows the solution?

Sorry - I award you ZERO points! That option sets things up so that on 
exit Pine asks you if you wish to copy all read mail to the 
"read-message-folder"; only if it does that will it mark the mail 
deleted. It will then only expunge it if you say yes, unless you have yet 
another option set. However, in none of the scenarios is it simply 
marking read mail as deleted ***without taking a copy of it somewhere 
else***, and even with all these opptions set, you still get the chance 
to say NO.

I have read in various FAQ's that it is possible to post to a limited 
geographic area.  I just posted to misc.wanted, and I was hoping that 
PINE would allow me to limit my posting to my local area, but it didn't.  
Did I miss a switch somewhere?  I'd really appreciate some help as I do 
not want to pollute everyone's newgroup lists with worthless messages.

Thanks from a newbie,

Mark

I'm trying to use Pine on a Linux box to access mailboxes on a Novell
server running Mercury's POP3 server.  As unlikely as it sounds, I've
managed to change Pine's global config file to point to the Mercury
POP3 server & it works!  Sometimes.

Unfortunately, Pine craps out a lot of the time.  Sometimes when
opening the mailbox and sometimes when going from the Main Menu to the
Index.   I've not yet found any clues about what makes it bomb.  Any
ideas? 

If anyone can suggest other ways to access Mercury's mailboxes from a
unix machine I'll be happy to hear them.

Thanks

With 3.91 at home under Linux this work fine.  But on the Ultrix machine
at uni, even with read-messages= set to nothing, it still prompts you
to "Save read...in read-mail [Y/N]".  It is very annoying.  So some

the local sysops are trying to keep the /var/spool/mail partition

IMAP an MUA ? 

IMAP is a driver, more appropriately a protocol by which mailfile gets
transmitted. It is a much much improved POP3 like protocol.
(read Terry Gray's fine article on the diff. between IMAP and POP)

You can write an MUA which uses IMAP to download mail from a mail-server.

In other words you are planning to write something better than Pine.
Good Luck!

Trey Harris writes in comp.mail.pine:
 +  (Is there a newsgroup for IMAP? A grep imap in my active file revealed
 +  nothing...)

 +  I am writing a Mail-user agent (MUA) for my users.  Not a generalized 
 +  program for their everyday mailreading, but rather to do some things that 
 +  my users are always asking me how to do and takes twenty or thirty 
 +  commands in pine (more if they don't yet have the aggregate-command-set 
 +  enabled).  However, since the program would have to access the mailboxes 
 +  and change their contents, it does meet the definition of a MUA.

 +  Since my users operate over a sealed IMAP server, we cannot allow them a 
 +  mail filtering program such as procmail (if anyone has ideas on this, let 
 +  me know).  So, I'm writing a simple program that will filter a user's 
 +  current mailbox at login time via IMAP.

 +  My question is this: it appears to me that, if I use IMAP and only IMAP 
 +  (i.e., I don't write anything in my script that will deal with Unix 
 +  textfile INBOXes), that I can jettison all the code one ordinarily must 
 +  write to deal with mailbox locking, because the IMAP daemon is already 
 +  doing them for me.

 +  Am I correct?  In essence, in an IMAP client/server situation, isn't it 
 +  the IMAP daemon which is the MUA for mail reading, since it is handling 
 +  all the locking issues and mail message formats?

 +  (Oh, by the way, I'm not totally aversive to writing mailbox-locking

You need an "Distribution:" header, which you can create in the 
customized-header and then invoke it while composing a post using
^R (for Rich headers) and adding values to it like
Distribution: USA
Distribution: temple

Distribution: world is the default.

There are two system-wide configuration files that can change the behavior
here.  Default values are set in /usr/local/lib/pine.conf and unchangeable
settings are set in /usr/local/lib/pine.conf.fixed.  Check the value of 
read-message-folder in those files and in your ~/.pinerc file.

The next release of Pine will indeed have hooks to make it easierr to use
PGP.  You will probably still want a script, but you won't need the
alternate-editor hack...

Filtering on a black-box IMAP server (no shell access) is currently an
unsolved problem.  We have implemented a partial solution in our tmail
delivery agent by supporting "user+folder" addressing, e.g. if you send a
message to dlm+pine@cac.washington.edu it will be delivered straight to my
"pine" incoming folder....

Correct, mailbox locking is the responsibility of the IMAP server in this

I wouldn't call IMAP an MUA, just a message access protocol :)

BTW, are you writing the IMAP code from scratch or using the c-client
library?

The brief answer to your question is "no".  The name of the lockfile is
something that is established by convention on Unix, and is used by other
Unix tools.  Since other Unix tools use mail files as well, what you're
trying to do isn't likely to work well.

We do, however, provide source code, so you can try to modify the routine
bezerk_lock() in imap/c-client/bezerk.c so that it doesn't try to make
the files.  You may find that this is problematic for other reasons
though.

Are you aware that the Unix mbox format is only supported as a read-only
format in PC-Pine?  If you want a read-write format on both systems, you
need to use the MTX format.  The file name for INBOX is INBOX.MTX in the
home directory.  This is a non-standard format for Unix.

Thanks for the hint - it worked fine.

I believe there are still several explicit references to the files
/usr/local/lib/pine.conf and /usr/local/lib/pine.conf.fixed in the 
documentation that is compiled into pine, however.  This could be 
moderately confusing to users.

This may sometimes be a cause of this but it is not the only one.

I had this problem for a while from only one person sending me mail from
their site.  When they sent from a differrent site (different mailer) no
problem.  I am absolutely sure I am the only one reading my mailbox and
only (always) with pine.  I tried a binary analysis of the mailfile but
could not find any differences.

    I note with glee that, similar to the pine-info mailing list, the IMAP
discussion is archived on the Pine FTP server.
    This means that it can be accessed via anonymous IMAP, for people who
want to catch up, but without downloading the whole archive, or for people
who want to drop in and listen without actually subscribing.

    As noted in a previous post, the syntax for accessing it is specific to
Pine3.xx and IMAP2bis, but for now it looks like this list, and a list for
discussing the C-Client, can be snooped on with folder specifications
Folder-Name *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}imap/[imap_archive]  or
                                                   /[c-client_archive] .
There may well be other mailing list archives elsewhere on this server,
or perhaps there are other servers with additional mailing list archives
which would be of interest to people to browse in this manner...

    Now I have yet another excuse not to have a life!  Yay!!

Is it running the IMAP server also? you should be able to use Pine to 
access the mail file on VMS if yes.

try
inbox-path={VMSsystemname}INBOX

or

inbox-path={VMSsystemname}NEWMAIL

you can also have in the folder-collections something like

folder-collections=vax {VMSsystemname}[],
	other things...

Subject: IMAP daemon as Mail-user agent
Date: 1 May 1995 15:38:38 GMT
Message-Id: <3o2v9u$176c@bigblue.oit.unc.edu>

(Is there a newsgroup for IMAP? A grep imap in my active file revealed
nothing...)

I am writing a Mail-user agent (MUA) for my users.  Not a generalized 
program for their everyday mailreading, but rather to do some things that 
my users are always asking me how to do and takes twenty or thirty 
commands in pine (more if they don't yet have the aggregate-command-set 
enabled).  However, since the program would have to access the mailboxes 
and change their contents, it does meet the definition of a MUA.

Since my users operate over a sealed IMAP server, we cannot allow them a 
mail filtering program such as procmail (if anyone has ideas on this, let 
me know).  So, I'm writing a simple program that will filter a user's 
current mailbox at login time via IMAP.

My question is this: it appears to me that, if I use IMAP and only IMAP 
(i.e., I don't write anything in my script that will deal with Unix 
textfile INBOXes), that I can jettison all the code one ordinarily must 
write to deal with mailbox locking, because the IMAP daemon is already 
doing them for me.

Am I correct?  In essence, in an IMAP client/server situation, isn't it 
the IMAP daemon which is the MUA for mail reading, since it is handling 
all the locking issues and mail message formats?

(Oh, by the way, I'm not totally aversive to writing mailbox-locking 
routines, I've just never done it before.  If anyone knows where I can go 
to read everything I ever wanted to know about mailbox locking, please do 
let me know.)

Yup. I can telnet to port 25 and also port 143 if that helps any.
There's an ethernet connection between the PC and Unix. I'm not sure if 
the Unix machine even knows that the request is coming from a PC.
It's (supposedly) standard Svr4 UNIX, with a few Tandem add-ons. If it is 
a security feature - I haven't heard of it through the local documentation.

Would you expect anything different if I was running the sendmail daemon 
instead of smtpd? (I somehow doubt it.)

You don't have to install procmail as a delivery-time filter.  Using the
-m flag, users can invoke it themselves, or it can be invoked on their
behalf by a script.  Of course, I don't know what your configuration is,
so I don't know if that's feasible for you.

	What TCP/IP stack are you running on the PC?  I've seen problems
with FTP Software's stack in version 2.3 and below.

"SMTP connection went away" indicates that the connection to the SMTP
server closed unexpectedly.  I wonder if there might be some sort of
"security" feature on the UNIX machine that prevents SMTP from the PC from
working.  Can you telnet to port 25 on the UNIX server from the PC?

Hi all,

I was hoping switch to emacs as the default editor for pine on SunOS 4.3.

Here is the line from my .pinerc

   editor=/usr/local/bin/emacs

Obviously, it doesn't work or I wouldn't be posting here.  When I compose
it drops me right into pico.  Any ideas?

Shannon,
When you look at your sent-mail folder, what do the From: lines look like?
If the sent-mail From: lines are correct, the problem is outside of Pine.

If these are incorrect: Do you have Pine's user-domain variable set?

Procmail includes a standalone utility, lockfile, that is emminently

Hi,

OK, I've got PC-Pine ... I've got Unix Pine ... I've got the imapd 
running ... I've got TCP/IP on the PC running. I can access my mail 
folders on the Unix machine with PC-Pine via imapd. This is GREAT, works 
well. (for windows, by the way).

Problem is that I can't send mail. When I send it, the screen beeps at me 
and then puts the cursor back up into the To: line. (a few seconds delay 
here and there as well)

What's wrong?

Do I need something else, like an SMTP gateway (this is what the PC guy 
tells me is required for commercial packages - but it costs big bucks) ?
I thought that Pine took care of this.

Help, I am a little confused.

	On a second minor point - how do I get PC-Pine to see an addressbook
	on the Unix machine. (or a signature for that matter)? When I specify
	{machine.here.there}/path/.addressbook it just creates a file on my
	PC's hard drive called c:/{machine.her 

Thanks,

Marc Kneppers

Hm.  Has my request for a flag to drop you into the composer with a given
file (possibly with headers, which Pine will use) been considered?  For
those of us who need/want to use newsreaders other than Pine, we would
love to be able to chuck whatever mail composer the newsreader furnishes
and use Pine instead.  I've looked at the Compose code, and it looks like 
it would be fairly easy to implement.

That's okay, just as long as you don't mean it won't work quite right for 
anyone. :)

I remember seeing your message and we still have it but have not
discussed it.  It sounds like a reasonable feature but it doesn't sound
totally trivial to implement, on first thought.  It will be considered.
Thanks.

We have noted that it would sometimes be useful for some config variables
to have a system-wide list that gets added to instead of replaced when a
user changes their own version of the same variable.  We haven't had time
to think about how to do that yet but will definitely try to do something
before 3.92, I think.  Thanks.

I'm having a little trouble trying to configure PC Pine on my PC to read my 
mail folders on my UNIX account. They don't want to appear when requested to 
do so in the folder list. However, if I try to explicitly open the folder by 
using goto and typing the folder name it will open. Also, I get an error 
message IMAP error: Command Unrecognised: create if I try to add a folder.

Any help would be appreciated.

Also, is it possible to embed the UNIX login and password in the program call?

Do a "build clean" and then use "build vul" instead of "build ult".  The
vul port is for VAX Ultrix.  As I remember, the only differences was in
switches to the C compiler.

Did you try changing the smtp-server variable in PC-Pine to point to some
other UNIX server?  Unfortunately, this sort of thing is very difficult
to debug remotely; also most versions of PC-Pine do not have any way to
record debugging telemetry (it'd be interesting to see where in the SMTP
transaction it chokes).

   Ok ... I've checked in the Pine technical notes, the comp.mail.pine
   directory in RTFM's Usenet FAQ archive and some of the notes with the
   IMAPd code I picked up for Linux.  Can't seem to find the answer to
   this - just hints.

   How's one setup anonymously accessible folders?  I'm interested in 
   dumping our old BULLETIN system and replacing it with folders that 
   people can access using the Pine mailer (or other IMAP clients).  
   Given what little I've seen so far, I'm not sure that this is the 
   implementation I want to use ... but it might be.

something like pine.conf.added (like pine.conf.fixed). 

yes, thats exactly what we need for this one :). 

any projections on when 3.92 will be available?

Three ways that I know of:

1. Do not "seal" your IMAP server, i.e. run your IMAP server as an
   ordinary machine capable of serving user logins.  Then IMAP won't
   even come into it because your mail transport agent will notice the
   .forward file in the user's home directory and deliver to the
   program (such as procmail).

2. Use Pine to do aggregate-command-set selection using the semicolon
   key followed by the (A)pply key.  Many of the things the average
   procmail user wants to do can be implemented in this way.  However,
   it must be done by hand every time you log in (or you could alias a
   pine command that had initial keystrokes, but that would be
   complicated).

3. If you must seal your IMAP server (and to me, at least, this is one
   of the primary reasons for using IMAP) and the Pine
   aggregate-command-set isn't powerful enough, then write a program
   which connects to the IMAP daemon, does the appropriate searches,
   and takes action on the messages returned.

There may be other ways, too.

No promises that will do something that general.  There are problems with

    I am new on this group, so please excuse me if this question has 
already been asked and answered.

    When using the Pine composer (under Unix, in my case), is there a way 
to include the text of a single message from a folder?  (I already know 
about ^R to read in a whole file.)

    Pointers to documentation are fine.

Thanks.

	I guess I don't really have to add much more after that Subject line,
do I? ;) Anyway... 

	My folder names are the same as the names in my address book, so,
when saving a mail, I use something like "ni<TAB>". And so, when entering a
nickname in the To/Cc/Bcc field of a message header, I often try to do the
same thing... But just end up with, for example, ni@aber.ac.uk. 

	So anyway, I just think that adding tab completion for that (and
maybe also for Fcc folder names) would be neat and very useful. 

	Thanks to anyone who listens... :)

Hiya!

I'm wondering it PINE allows you to fiddle with the Path line at the top 
of a USENET article:

Path: 
template.com!news1.digex.net!news2.digex.net!howland.reston.ans.net!news.sprint
link.net!news.cais.com!NewsWatcher!user


Our xrn users can customize this line for outgoing postings, but a lot of
people are switching to PINE to post to USENET, and we'd like to have them
do the same thing. 

Thanks a lot!

No luck, we're not on the net and only have one UNIX server. We've been 
playing around with the tcp/ip stack etc. on the pc's but nothing has

How can I prevent PINE from converting my ASCII-Code above 127
to strange items =95 a.s.o.

That on relly hurts. It effectively prevents me from sending german
messages.

Another choice would be to run an 'imapd' on your mail-provider
(provided you have that kind of power).  Then you can set things up so
that both pine versions get their mail and keep their local message
folders on the remote machine.  If I've jumped in in the middle, and
don't understand what you're really asking, please accept my
apologies.

	 I have just installed Pine on a PC. It is using an IMAP server
	on a VAX running PMDF. I can access my folders okay but when
	I try to send a message first it:

	 Balked the default-Fcc: couldnt open it, create?. If you said 
	yes it beeped twice and returned to the To: field. 

	 When I changed the configuration to "" for default-Fcc it just 
	beeped twice and returned to the To: prompt without telling me 
	anything.

	 Is there a log somewhere to see the error message (if any)?.

I was told that at my college I was not aloud to upgrade my version of 
pine 3.87 to the new version that is in my update section 3.91.  I was 
wondering if anyone would be able to help me understand this.  I thought 
that if my account was ever upgraded it would have to be upgraded from 
within my account and that would have to be from within my account 
protected password section of the unix system.  I am on a DEC-ALPHA 
system that runs on a 56K leased line.  The only way I am able to post to 
this newsgroup is from within my updated version of pine I am using in a 
different connection that I pay for seperate from school account.  I 
really enjoy the 3.91 section over the 3.87 version.

Hello,

	I'm looking for information on configuring PC-Pine 3.91 to work 
with the IMAP/RIMAP daemons on a file server.  My PC is running the 
following:

		. DOS 6.22
		. Windows For Workgroups (3.11) -- Workgroups deactivated
		. PC-NFS 5.1a
		. PC-Pine 3.91 for Windows

	When I run the application in Windows, it attempts to access the 
remote inbox ({serverName}inbox) the way that it should.  The problem 
appears to be occurring when the authentication process begins.  I 
continually get problems trying to bind to the IMAP daemon and I believe 
the problem MAY be the fact that a password must be validated by the IMAP 
daemon to gain access to the remote inbox.  We have been able to 
successfully access remote inboxes via IMAP in heterogeneous SPARC 
environments, but PCs have a serious problem with the authentication.

	Any help anyone may have to offer (pointers to HTTP sites, FAQs, 
etc) will be greatly appreciated.  Thanks very much for your time.

							Marco

Marco,
You haven't given very many details about what exactly you see.
What are the precise symptoms?

If you attempt to telnet to port 143 of the server and manually enter a
login command

  aa login username password

what happens?

Do you have a printer defined in your .login or .profile?  I would start
by seening what the system defined printers are and then if they are
accessable from pine.

To me IMAP seems so close to allowing this...

IMAP allows you to open non-mail folders, so couldn't there be some way of 
getting IMAP to edit files like .forward and .procmailrc? 

Actually, this reminds me of an earlier post I made asking if IMAP could 
be used to store a central .pinerc file on the IMAP server instead of the 
client - same principle - just opened up a bit further... Local filters 
like procmail would be more efficient than getting the mailer to go 
through filter hoops...

That would be most excellent - but it would be moving away from the 
simple model...

Hello. I'm trying to filter all the mail I receive so that the messages I 
get from a listserv are separated for my personal mail.. I guess I want 
the mail to be put into two folders (?), one fir the listserv and one for 
everything else. BUT I have no idea how to do this. I'm on a UNIX machine 
(or should I say I dial into a unix machine?) So :) how do I do this?
In some PINE manual it says I have to do this in unix but I don't know 
how to do that either.
any help would be greatly appreciated.

Um, yes.  I've been running Unix machines for enough years to know about
the EDITOR variable, at least. :) And if you have a sane newsreader, it
will let you use an alternate editor from the one in the EDITOR
environment variable. But will that save the outgoing mail in my sent-mail
folder?  Even if there's a way to do it, will it use IMAP, as I do with
Pine?  Can I use my Pine address-book nicknames in the Cc: line?  Can I
postpone the message for later?  Can I attatch a MIME-encoded file, if I'm
responding to someone who needs some source code or a binary file that I
have? 

You see what I'm getting at.  It isn't Pico I want, it's *Pine*.  Right 
now, I have my newsreader (trn) set up as an alias, like follows:

alias trn='/usr/local/bin/trn ; pine -f respond-to'

and when I'm using trn, I save any messages I want to respond to in the 
respond-to folder, and when I quit trn, Pine starts up. This works, but 
it's kludgy and it has a number of looming problems, most notably of 
which is what if the respond-to file needs to be an IMAP folder rather 
than a local file?

It should do both ... the pine Y prYnt command is not really a printer

you're on a pc running dos or windozzzz, connected to a server running 
unix).  That's why it 'scrolls' the message up as it (or before it) 
prints.

That's the best way to do it with long messages, 'cause you can do it

it's a pain in the ass for short messages I agree.

One possible solution ... if ya got a fast modem and a slow terminal (as 
in 386) (saw one last week at an antique show :-)) slow it (the modem) 
down when yer prYnting, because it will 'scroll' too fast.
I connect at 28800 or 14400 depending, and set the modem 
(temporarily) to 1200 (yes that's 12 hundred not thousand) and it works 
fine.  Anything faster and it skips stuff (remember it's a screen 
capture, not really a printer driver).  Don't know what software yer 
usin, but I can change modem speeds while connected, if yours can't, 
you'll have to logout then reset then .login again (also a pain in the 
ass).  This is only my homemade method of doing it, never saw it 
published anywhere, but what the hell, it works.

You could add an NFS client like XFS to your DOS stack and put the folders on
the Linux partition.

I just got an error message this morning. Can someone tell me what it 
means and how serious it is?

I was in my sentmail folder, and a bar appeared at the bottom of the 
screen saying "Mailbox format invalidated (consult an expert), aborted"

Then, a message said, (Mail folder Inbox closed due to access error)

Does this mean someone has accessed my mail files? 

Thanks

Hello to all...

I would like to know how to set up an alias so that I can receive

For example, say I have an account with username "joe" but everyone
else knows me as "joe1."

How would I set up an alias using pine so that everyone who sends 
mail to "joe1" will have their mail delivered to "joe"?

    The answer is yes.  I used to be a system programmer on IBM mainframe 
systems running PROFS, and we did it all the time.  Provided everybody is 
connected to the net and has all the addressing squared away, nothing 
special needs to be done.  Just treat a PROFS recipient like any other 
email address.

    You say the user's node is ge1vm.  That looks to me to be an 
insufficient address.  You probably need I106@ge1vm.<some-domain>.  You 
will need to find out the user's domain to make it work.  Then it should 
go with no further problems (if, as I say, everybody is hooked up).

    Just remembered.  Your system will need to know about the user's 
domain in your Domain Name System (DNS) tables, and his/her system will 
need to know about yours.  That's a system administrator function.

There have been several suggestions made so far.  I'm going to recap some 
of them and add several possibities that haven't been mentioned.  I will 
not mention suggestions that involve firing up a Mail User Agent to act 
on the mail store, as I think most people want filtering to be done by
the delivery agent at "message delivery time", rather than by an MUA at 
"message reading time"...

1. Run IMAP on an "unsealed" system where logins are permitted and 
   procmail or filter or deliver can be used in the normal way. <Harris>
2. Run IMAP on a "semi-sealed" system which shares some state with 
   systems where logins are permitted.  One scenario: the IMAP server
   does not permit user logins, but imports user home directories and the
   delivery agent respects any .forward entries it finds.
3. Teach your delivery service to do filtering based on information
   the user loaded into some directory service (such as LDAP).  <Myers>
4. Mailbots.  It is possible to construct a service for manipulating
   a procmail (etc.) rule base via email messages.  The advantage is
   being able to use any mail client to, for example, set a vacation 
   msg.  A key requirement is for the requestor to be authenticated,
   which could be done in any of several ways, e.g. PGP, or some form of 
   "two-party authentication" wherein a "magic cookie" is sent to the 
   user's mailbox by the mailbot engine and is used in subsequent 
   transactions for authentication.  In its simplest form, this scheme
   would have a very limited set of services (e.g. vacation setup) and
   a correspondingly simple command syntax (and/or a task-specific set of
   mailbot addresses.)  One can imagine a more general-purpose rule 
   definition language being transmitted to the delivery filter via this 
   kind of mechanism.  (Laurence Lundblade at Virginia Tech has been working
   on such a language, which he has dubbed "Sift-TCL".)
5. WWW forms.  WWW forms are being used for *everything* these days, even 
   session-oriented transaction sequences that require authentication.
   I can't see any reason why someone couldn't solve the remote procmail
   configuration problem using this approach.

On 3 May 1995, Jason Haar asked why you couldn't edit procmail config
files via IMAP, and why it couldn't be used to store Pine config files.

The answer for both questions is that a case can be made for having 
several simple protocols for different tasks, rather than one "does 
everything" protocol.

In the case of remote access to pine configuration data, we expect to use 
the IMAP companion protocol, IMSP, which is being developed at CMU.

In the case of procmail configuration data, any of the options listed
above seem plausible.  In principle, since IMAP supports an APPEND
operation, one could write arbitrary data to a file on the server and
invent an agent that could do something useful with it, but even though I
also like to reuse existing mechanism rather than inventing new, I'm not
convinced that's the best approach to this particular problem.

Cynthia,

Pine does not currently support compressed folders.  There have been 
several requests, but we don't have the resources to implement them at 
this time.  

Thanks for the request!

One of the reasons that the file driver in the UW IMAP server is Read-Only
is that allowing an IMAP client to write a free-format flat file would
open up a pandora's box of security problems.  For example, if Pine could
write a .forward file in someone's home directory, what would prevent it
from writing a .cshrc file or .rhosts file?  At least with a mailbox
format file you are not too likely to be able to do that kind of damage. 
Solving that and other problems would take IMAPd far down a path that we
are not eager to explore in a "message access" service...

Thanks for the reply, that's a big load off of my shoulders.  I get
charged for going over 5M with my provider and that file put me
dangerously close.  The only "crash" I've ever had with Pine is when I'm
telnetting in to my provider to check my mail and my connection drops. 
That must be where the file came from.  I'm happy to report to you that I
find your program EXTREMELY stable and very easy yet powerful to use.  I
go through about 150 messages a day and have never had anything go wrong
with PINE.  I do have a problem with my carriage returns messing up
quoted text in messages (by justifying them) but am sure that is User
Error since I haven't tried to investigate it.  Again, thanks for the
reply.

And there is even an option so that save will not delete.

I agree with the last poster (Leng) that Pine does NOT mark read mail as
Deleted - there is no option to set it up that way either.

The search for a nickname in the address books is done using a hash table
in order to obtain sufficient speed.  The hash value depends on all of
the characters in the nickname, so it is difficult to do completion with
only some of the name.  So probably it won't be implemented soon.  Sorry.

If you wish to use a mail agent of your choice to respond by email to
News postings:

Create a tiny program called 'mailme', and a suitable macro for your
news reader that will pipe a News posting through this program.  Here
is the program that I use:

   #! /bin/sh
   # Mail me the input, used from rn or nn to convert articles
   # to mail messages.  Standard input must contain all needed headers.
   # -i tells sendmail to ignore dots in input.  R. Dhesi
   /bin/cat $* | /usr/lib/sendmail -i dhesi

When you wish to send an email response to a News posting, just pipe it

Hi,
	I am having a problem with the enable-full-header option in
the setup. One of the users needs to see a field called "Received
From" and does not see it. I have set up someone else *exactly* the
same in the .pinerc and it works, but in this case it does not
display. Any ideas are greatly appreciated. Thanx much.

Thanks to Barry for pointing this out.  The problem was indeed with Zterm,
my modem program, which doesn't support anything better than vt100 as a=20

translation to ISO 8859-1, things have been working just fine.  I'd be=20

Here's a little test string of some accented characters:
=E9=E8=A7=BB=EC=EB=EA=E8=E7=E6=E4=F3=E1=F1=F7re=F6=E3=F8=FA=EE=ED

If anyone receives these as a set of characters with accents, I'd be=20
grateful for a note telling me so. =20

Let me second fbennet@cais.com's request.  I have not been able to get the
spell checker to work for Pine under Linux either.  The version is Pine
3.91.  The Pico version is 2.5, and I'm using ispell 3.1.08 for the
speller.  When I try to spell check (^T), I get the ispell help screen,
which suggests that ispell is being called but the correct file name is
not being passed on.  I asked about this a few days ago, but never saw an
answer. 

If the Pine/Pico experts in Washington State (or elsewhere) could help 
us, you'll have at least two grateful users (fbennet and me.)

    Perhaps...  I have an account with a service provider who is using
BSD/OS or BSD/386, and core dumps get the name of the process which was
running appended, as opposed to the simple file named core which I get
from other systems I use.  Are you, by chance, using a BSD/OS system?
    On this system, it is a frequent occurrence that people get dropped
and their orphaned Pine process spins out of control, taking as much CPU
as it can and driving the system load up.  I've told the SysAdmins here
that when they see such a Pine session, they should just kill it.  With
a signal given to a running Pine process, such as  kill -QUIT <pid>, I
can force my hung Pine sessions to create a core.pine file -- maybe your
provider has given your Pine session such a kill command...


>I do have a problem with my carriage returns messing up

    Nope, I don't think so.  I have this same problem and more when I
telnet to the BSD/OS system from NCSA telnet for the Mac -- it doesn't
appear to get the proper stty settings, so that your RETURN is sent and
interpreted as the ^J linefeed.  I can telnet to this BSD/OS from other
telnet clients and use Pine and Emacs with no problems, and I can also
telnet from Mac NCSA telnet to other OS machines and use Pine or Emacs
with no problems.  Presumably there are other telnet clients which have
problems with the BSD/OS telnetd, and other telnetd's that have problems
with Mac NCSA telnet.  I get around this by telnetting from Mac NCSA 
telnet to a different machine, from which I telnet again to the BSD/OS.
Awkward, but it works around the problems I have...

automatically added to a mail group.

Can anyone tell me how to configure pine so that it will display the 8 bit
characters used for French, German, and spanish diacritics (accents)? 
I've changed the character-set value in Pine's 3.91's setup menu to
ISO-8859-1 with no success.  From time to time, however, some messages do
make it through which include accents, presumably because of something the
sender did.  I'm running a vt100 terminal shell on a Unix system from a
Macintosh, for what it's worth. 

Extra bonus points to the person who can tell me how to type accents into 
Pine-unix from my Mac keyboard or from an X-term. 

I would be very grateful if could be cc'ed on any replies to this post. 
I'm at eahg076@ea.oac.uci.edu

Many thanks,
Eric

This is going to change when Pine converts to IMAP4.  The present way of
doing this is to set those folders up as subdirectories of ~ftp, as if
you were setting up an anonymous FTP server.  Then, create the file
	/etc/anonymous.newsgroups
The folders can then be accessed through Pine as collection
	*{server/anonymous}[]

As I said, this is going to change in IMAP4.  Most likely, the collection
name will become something like:
	{server/anonymous}#ftp#[]
Although there may be some other means of exporting public files besides
this.

I've got the server - you're right, it's our local UNIX machine.
WHen I send mail however, it doesn't work. I get the messages that the 
SMTP connection "went away".
THe machine I am connecting to is running svr4 UNIX and it handles SMTP 
just fine.
I've got the smtp-server configuration parameter set to the UNIX machine's 
name and that works fine since I can go to the UNIX machine and 
get IMAP to serve me a file.

Are there any permissions that I need to set or extra files that I need to 
enter the IMAP service in (other than /etc/services and inetd.conf)?

Does SMTP need to be told to expect mail from outside the local machine 
or does IMAp take care of that? We aren't connected to the net yet but we do 
have IP addressed on the UNIX machine and the PC's

Thanks

    Make sure you have an 8-bit path from your Pine session to your
display, and have a suitable (ISO 8859-1) font selected.  Generally the
first seems to be the default, while you may need to change something
to get the second to happen.  (In your case, you do have the 8-bit path.)

    Then that sender is probably making proper use of MIME to get the
messages to you intact.  Other messages probably are either using an
encoding which differs from yours, or are losing the 8th bit due to
not making use of MIME, depending on what you see.


>  I'm running a vt100 terminal shell on a Unix system from a
>Macintosh, for what it's worth. 

    This could be a problem.  What Mac program are you using?  How is
that program configured -- does it do the translation from the mail's
ISO 8859-1 character set to the Mac display set?  And what do you see
when messages ``don't include accents''?  With NCSA Telnet for the Mac,
look to see what is selected under Translation...


>Extra bonus points to the person who can tell me how to type accents into 
>Pine-unix from my Mac keyboard or from an X-term. 

    Make sure you have an 8-bit input path to your Pine session, with
stty pass8  or whatever is needed.  From your Mac, choose a different
keyboard to correspond with the language you intend to use, or make use
of the Option (I think it is) key, which, when combined with, say, the
character ``u'', adds a diaeresis (umlaut) to the character typed next.
Or use Popchar.
    From your xterm, use the Compose key or the Meta key, whatever is
set up to work for you, to apply an accent to a character.  (For example,
Compose " followed by  u  should give the u-diaeresis, which could also
be created as Meta | .)  You may need to set some additional environment
variables depending on your setup.

I just downloaded the latest ver. of Pc-Pine. I am trying to access my

Here is what it looks like

My PC with PC-Pine
Host1 running IMAP2
Host2 running IMAP2

I can use Pc-Pine to read mail on Host1
I cannot use Pc-Pine to read mail on Host2
but I CAN use Pine on Host1 to read mail on Host2

What gives? I could understand if I could not read mail on Host2 from 
anywhere, but I just have a problem when using Pc-Pine.

TIA for any help.

server through serial lines using trumpet winsock with wfw311.

Right now, our students have to telnet into our linux host and run pine from 
a shell.  Frequently, pine will lock or a student will go off without 
logging out. 

What I would like to be able to do is have the students not even have to
login to the unix machine to get their mail.  I would like to have them
sit down at the public terminals, run pine, supply a login name and
password, and get their mail without having to mess with the linux side of
it.  I don't want any user information stored on the local machines since
it will be a different person using it the next time. 

I got pc-pine to run once and ask all that information, but then it asked 
me if I wanted to write the information to the ini file.  This is 
unacceptatble.  I can't have students using their information as the 
defaults (even though some of them live at the terminals).

I have IMAP setup so that I can read from pc-pine in my office (where I 
am the only person who uses that machine) - but I want to provide 
generic mail capabilities where the username is grabbed from the linux 
system based on the login name and password supplied.

I need to know if there is some way I can do this.

Thanks.

Why not start pine with a script which uncompresses the relevant months.
Current an however months back by default and perhaps a month name as
a parameter to unpack as far back as that month.

No, the print command in Pine is not a screen capture utility.  The
problem is that an unfortunately large number of communication packages
have broken or non-existant implementations of ANSI printer controls. 
Pine has a very simple procedure for printing.  First, it sends an escape
sequence to switch output to the printer, then it sends the text, then it
sends the sequence to switch back to the screen.  A properly functioning
ANSI emulation will not affect the display while printing.

The current Linux port of Pine assumes that the standard spell checker is
/bin/spell and that it works the same as on other Unix versions.  To get 
ispell to work, see the question about ispell in the Pine FAQ.  Here is 
an excerpt:

    2. Pine already checks the SPELL environment variable so you can
       create the following script and name it spell. 
       

     #!/bin/sh
     ispell -l | sort | uniq 

   To make Ctrl-T in pine use 'ispell' and your '$HOME/.ispell_words'
       dictionary: 
          + make the above script file 'spell' in your home directory 
          + make it executable: 'chmod u+x spell' 
          + set the environment variable SPELL: 'setenv SPELL
            $HOME/spell' (you may include this command in your .profile,
            .cshrc or .login file) 
   
       
       Now, when you press Ctrl-T in Pine, you will execute the ispell
       program, and it will recognize words stored in the private
       dictionary. The screen display will look like pine is using the
       standard spell-checking program. Unfortunately, this method does
       not allow the user to Insert words into the private dictionary.
       However, this might be useful with a central script file (setenv
       SPELL ...) and a central private dictionary (ispell -p ...) to
       provide a common private dictionary for an entire workgroup. The
       manager could add items to the private dictionary; ordinary pine
       users would use the private dictionary (Ctrl-T), but they could
       not change it.

In a previous article, mrc@CAC.Washington.EDU (Mark Crispin) says:

(about how to set up anonymous IMAP access to FTP server files...)

    Can you say more about this?  Specifically, is it sufficient to
touch /etc/anonymous.newsgroups , or should it contain entries?  And
if it should, what should be the format of those entries?
    And it appears that the folders need to be specified as
        *{imap.server/anonymous}path/name/[]

    I make this claim in that the Pine home FTP server, ftp.cac.washington.edu
when accessed in the manner you give from Pine3.91, returns the contents of
the ~ftp chrooted top-level directory.  Text files in that directory are
readable by Pine, but subdirectories such as pine/ fail to be opened by
the IMAP client Pine.

    In other words, for me to access the archives of pine-info, which I
do on occasion from Pine, the proper format with 3.91 and IMAP2bis is
        Pine-info *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/pine-info/[]
...which, as a .pinerc entry, gives me as folders, all the months of
pine-info.  (Can't wait to see lots of other mail archives made available
this way instead of multi-kilo/megabyte files for anon FTP!)

Thanks...

Pine 3.92 wish list idea:

allow the selection of multiple newsgroups in the "add/subscribe" 
newsgroups feature.  I realize Pine prompts if you "really" want to 
subscribe to "x.y.z" newsgroup.  this would help since the newsgroup 
lookup is often time-sonsuming.  the addition of multiple groups takes a

who first placed in their code the idea of "do you REALLY want to do this"
should be shot and forced to read LOGO.  of course I wanted to "do

This isn't an exact answer, but you could try using the Smartlist package
with procmail (our mail delivery agent).  If oyu get it to work, let me
know :-)

It's at:

ftp://Harry.Informatik.RWTH-Aachen.DE:/pub/packages/procmail

somewhere.  It and procmail allow you to handle a lot of mail filtering
and auto-processing when mail arrives.

People on one of the mailing lists I'm on have been wondering why some
people's mail has little "=20"s at the end of each line.  I'm positive
I've seen an explanation of it in the past, but the only thing I can
remember about it now was that pine was somehow implicated in it.  If
any of you could provide an explanation, I would appreciate it -- mainly
because I hate it when I know I've heard the details of something before
but can no longer remember even the gist of them.  Thanks.

I have about 230 logins in a distribution list and much to my surprise 
I've discovered that several people aren't getting the messages I send 
using this list.

Is there a limit to the number of logins that can be placed in a 
distribution list?

Has anyone else experienced this problem?

Thanks for any light you can shed on my problem.

	 I have installed Pine on My PC. I am using a Vax as my mail

	PMDF as my IMAP server. I followed the example in the 4.3
	manual for PMDF for installing a SMTP server using MULTINET.

	 The problem is when I send a message with the PC pine the

	"Sending mail ...." message. Then when the message finally 
	is sent the window locks up tight. Windows will not even let

	Could!!.

	 Is there some pmdf.cnf setting to increase the "robustness"
	of the SMTP server?. Is there something wrong with the pine 
	settings on the PC which causes it to lock up?.

	The relevant portions of PMDF.cnf looks like so:

No, IMAP does not allow that, in general.

Away from the simple model, yes, but towards where IMAP4 and IMSP are 
going in the future.

IMSP allows the saving of configuration variables, etc., in the 
centralized repository.  It also allows the IMSP server to tell a client 
where its IMAP mailbox is, which means that if you want to run twenty 
IMAP servers, your users don't need to know on which their mailbox resides.

For more, check out the Cyrus IMAP4 server page, which has links to the 
IMAP4, IMAP4 authentication methods, and IMSP RFCs.

It's at http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/cyrus/cyrus.

I would assume she is using a common shortened form for 'login id', which

Not all of us.  It wasn't me who wrote what you attributed to me

"vee-tah", not "vih-tuh" like you strange furuhners pronounce
"vitamins".

(Just kidding.  But that *is* how modern Greek pronounces that letter,
Greek lost the "b" phoneme over a millenium ago.)

In the few cases it happened to me, this was due to NFS inconsistency problems.
On IRIX, it happens from time to time, when a message is delivered to a NFS
mounted texfile mailbox, which resides on another machine, and the delivery
program is on a differen machine, than the reading one.

The problem is that all of a sudden, a virtual page of 4K is being cleaned to
0es. When this happens in the middle of a message, pine gets confused.

To check whether this is the case, fire an editor, in which you can see 0es,
like emacs, on the NFS client host and see the contents of the message. I bet
you you'll see the 0es. On the other hand, emacs running locally on the NFS
server sees it right.

The quick fix in such situations is to save the damaged message form the local
emacs to a file, _before_ quitting pine. Another solution is to start a local
(to the NSF server) pine, and visit the mailbox in question, which will acquire
the lock from the remote one and prevent damage.

Solution? May be an IMAP server, serving local boxes.

Hope that helps,

I couldn't find the FAQ file for this group.  I'm desperately seeking 
help on this issue.  The online help files are VERY poorly written and my 
Internet Service Provider is refusing to help on the grounds that "if we 
had to help every individual set this up, we wouldn't have time for 
anything else."  Which may be true, but is awfully lame.  Hasn't =anyone= 
out there taken the time to create a simple menu-driven or

Thanks to any and all who respond.

Hi,
	I understand that if I did not specify the sendmail agent when I 
build pine, I will get the default mail agent ie "sendmail".

1)	How can I change the sendmail agent to  use "mailx" ?
2)	In which document can I find this piece of information ?

	Please help !!!!!

Hhummmmm ... I think the problem is that you assume we (Edward who asked
the original question, and I) have a printer attached to the computer
which is running PINE (or that we're running PC PINE).  Not so; In my case
(and I think also in Ed's) we are on a dial-up connection via modem to an
internet provider runing unix (in my case BSD) PINE.  I am (as is he)
using a 486 desktop PC with a printer attached to LPT1.  I am (don't know
about him) running under Windows, and using Widows Terminal as the
communication package..  I am on a basic ASYNC connection, no graphics.  I
have my PINE Setup to print to attached-to-ansi. 

OK, now here's the problem.  When I choose Y (prYnt) it in fact DOES
scroll my screen, and since I have a fast modem connection (14400 at
present, I could go 28800 but my server can't handle it yet) the printout
which starts 2 or 3 seconds later, has a lot of missing lines, sometimes
even broken right in the middle of a line. 

A month or so ago, I was helping a friend set up his account on his 
computer, and he has a slow (2400) modem and his prYnt command worked 
fine, so I said to myself, 'self, maybe it's the screen scrolling too 
fast that's causing my problem', and sure enough when I got back and 
slowed mine down, it worked OK, actually works even better at 1200.  Now 
I don't know if my original reply which called it 'screen capture' was 
the correct terminology, but in effect that's what it seems to be doing.

All I was trying to do was tell ED how to make it work, with what he had 
available, even though it's sort of a homemade solution.

Is there a better way to do it?  For example is there some command string 
I could put under PINE setup outher than the default (lpr) which would 
direct it to MY printer?  I don't think so, but ??  The reason I say I 
don't think so, is that seems to want a unix command which my PC will not 
understand running windows or dos.  Or would a better communications 
package (other than windows terminal) help.  I have CoMit available, I 
tried it once, didn't like it, and took it off, but I could reinstall it.

Thanks for any help you might give on this.

Hi All,
   I have just reconfigured my Sparc, and I would like to get a nicer
mailer agent.  I have heard a bit about Pine before, and I'd like to
pull it down and compile it.  For SunOS 4.1.3, what would be the most
"stable" version.  I don't need a lot of fancy features, just a better
mailer than /bin/mail.  Also, where do I get it and are there any gotchas
for SunOS 4.1.3?

Thanks,
Ted

This won't work using Pico as a stand-alone editor though; like the
man page says, the -t switch works from within another program.

    This sounds like the very same problem I am having with Pine 3.91 on 
a Unix system.  I put out a sounder on my service provider's newsgroup.  
Some respondents have suggested fiddling with the shell and local 
variables, but it doesn't seem to make any difference.  I also am hoping 
someone will have an answer.

Get umsdos package for linux and mount your dos partition as umsdos.  Linux
will treat it as a regular unix partition (long file names, etc.)  DOS, on
the other hand, will see the same file names, if they confirm to DOS file
system standards.  If they don't, then such filenames will be changed.  Actual
file names are kept in a separate file.

I don't guarantee that this'll work, but if you do this, linux will be able
to create *.lock files, and DOS should see all your folders without any
problems.

Hope this helped

    My non-MIME-aware newsreader lets me know these are accented characters.
If I mail myself this message from the mailer which does not pass 8-bit
characters and view it with an ISO 8859-1 xterm running Pine, I see...

I hope this isn't in the FAQ ...

Is there a way in pine of "undigesting" mail received in digest form?  
For example, rmail in GNU emacs offers an undigest command.  View-mail 
binds this function to the '@' key to indicate an exploding digest, as I 
recall.  Are there similar facilities in pine?  I wasn't able to locate 
anything on digests in the help files.

John,
David was not assuming that your printer was attached to the 
machine running Pine.  In fact, the whole purpose of "attached-to-ansi"
mode is to deal with exactly the hardware configuration you describe;
however, you must:

 o have a communication program on the PC that understands ansi printer
   escape sequences.

 o pay careful attention to flow-control issues.

There's no screen capture involved, and if there was, that would be a
function of your comm program rather than Pine. If, when you print from Pine
using "attached-to-ansi" and you see the text on your PC screen, you
assuredly do *not* have a communications program that fully understands ansi
printer escapes. 

If some things print, but you lose data, especially on longer messages, 
that almost always means there is a flow-control problem somewhere.
See the Pine FAQ for more details on printing problems...

Is there a way to get Unix pine to ignore ^M in a folder file?

Specifically, I have both Linux & Microsoft Windows on my PC.  In 
windows, I have a program called Eudora that does pop-mail.  Since I can 
mount the dos partition under linux, I would like to just have a symbolic 
link to the file Eudora uses.  When I try this, and use pine to access 
the link as a folder, it says there is 1 message in the folder.  When I 
try to look at it, it says that it can't find 
"APPLICATION/OCTET-STREAM".  If I copy the dos file to linux and strip 
out the ^M s from it, it will then read the file just fine.  Is there 
anything I can do?  I have tried ELM on the link file, and it works fine 
(though I like Pine much better and would prefer to find some solution 
using it.)

I hope this is clear :-)

Thanks.

	Jerry

The problem is not that procmail does its filtering at delivery-time (and 
.forward files are not available) but rather that home directories are 
not available to the mail server and /var/spool/mail is not available to 
the login machines.  Maybe there's some way to do it, but the ways I can 
think of are pretty hairy and would require sysadmin intervention 
whenever the user wants to change one of his or her filtering rules--not 
feasible with 20,000 users!

Are you sure it's Pine and not sendmail playing with rewrite rules?  
Sounds to me like a common thing for sendmail to do, especially when you 
have a centralized mail hub available at the domain level.  Read 
/etc/sendmail.cf to see if that's what it is doing.  (I'm not going to 
tell you which rulesets to look at, because anybody who claims to know 
the function of rulesets greater than 4 is lying, since they have no 
mandatory function.)

I have noticed that when using pine (3.90 and 3.91), on occasion text is in
inverse video when it shouldn't be.  It happens extremely rarely, and
refreshing the screen clears it.  I have noticed it both on Linux and logged
into two different AIX boxes.

If I go to enter a message using the built in editor, then enter characters
on the 18th line of the message which correspond to any or all characters of
the '----- Message Text -----' screen header, then do a ^Y then a ^V, those
characters in the 18th line of the message that do correspond to 
'----- Message Text -----' will be printed in inverse video.  

If you are not clear about what I mean then:
	- start composing a message and move to the first line of body
	- hit enter 17 times
	- enter '----- Message Text -----'
	- hit ^Y
	- hit ^V

The '----- Message Text -----' in the body should be in inverse video.  I
only noticed it because my signature starts with an '-- ' and it happened to
be on that line when I went to the previous page then back to that page.

Has anyone else seen this behavior?  It's not a big problem since it doesn't
really affect much, but if an easy fix can be made perhaps it should.

We've been running Pine 3.90 for SunOS 4.1.3, and 4.1.1, 4.1.2, Sol 2.3 
on Sparcs with good results. 

We've just moved up to 3.91 which has improved the speed for starting Pine
and are waiting (along with the masses) for Pine 3.92. 

No gotchas to mention, maybe just be aware when you're compiling that debug
mode is on by default. You may want to turn this off eventually because it
tends to create debug files.

Does anybody know if there's a way to make PINE performa a "catch up" 
type function on news groups? That is, automatically delete say all
messages before a certain date (and keep the ongoing threads if possible)
in a particular newsgroup. Obviously this is useful if the user has been
away for a while or hasn't read news for a few days.

Thanks.

I believe pine encodes certain characters in messages that contain
non-standard ascii.  If this thusly-encoded message is sent to a
mailer which doesn't know how to interpret them, it sends them on
literally, and they show up in the encoded format.  Is this list in a
language other than English?

Um...we were talking about IMAP, right?  How else?  That's the real 
reason to use IMAP, to offload all the mail access services from your 
login machine to your IMAP server.  And frankly, I don't especially want 
lots of procmail stuff, etc., running on that server, since it's running 
fairly smoothly and sometimes jerkily with just sendmail and imapd running.

I'm glad it works for you, but it sounds like a nightmare when I apply it 
to my site, which has 20,000 users currently (but a growth rate of 200% 
per year!).  Considering that all of my machines are in one machine room, 
connected by a high-speed fiber net, I don't see the latency concerns as 
a problem.

I saw source somewhere for a rewrite of /bin/mail that, when used for
delivery, checked to see if it was attempting to deliver over an NFS link,
and if so, would abort the save and deliver the mail message to the NFS
server via SMTP.  Nifty.  (I've also heard that that's what SPARCs do by
default, but I'm unable to verify that.)

It's in English.  But the postings might include odd characters at
times.  I'll watch for that.  Thanks for the response.

I have two questions:

2. When viewing a newsgroup in pine hwo do you delete multiple messages 
   instead of hitting the d key many times over?

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks

Aliases (or "nicknames" or "addressbooks") are not what you want in this 
case.  You cannot change the address by which you can receive mail 
without the assistance of a system administrator.

Let me explain the reasons for this.  Suppose your boss's username is 
"boss".  If you can make it so that all mail that's destined for "joe1" 
will be rerouted to "joe", then it stands to reason that you could also 
make it so that all mail to "boss" goes to "joe".  A system that allowed 
you to divert anyone else's email to you at any time would not be a very 
good one!

This doesn't mean that there's nothing that you can do.  You didn't say 
in the above why everyone knows you as joe1.  Perhaps you have two 
accounts, one named joe and another older one named joe1?  If so, create 
a file called ".forward" in joe1's home directory, with the single line 
"joe".

Even if there isn't a joe1 account extant, there is another facility for
getting mail addressed to another name. Such system-wide or recipient-end
aliasing is very common on the Internet.  Contact your system
administrator; he or she should know what to do. 

If you are the system administrator for your site, you'll need to take 
the following steps:

1. Become root.

2. Open /usr/lib/aliases (the filename may slightly differ on some
   systems, a find /usr -name aliases -print should find it) in your
   favorite text editor.

3. At the bottom of the file (or wherever convenient) add the line:

joe1:	joe

   (That's joe1, colon, tab, joe.)

4. Save and quit your editor, and run "sendmail -bi".

5. Now all mail directed to joe1 will go to joe instead.

If you are using a mail-transport agent other than sendmail, the steps
may differ.  In Sendmail V8, you can also set up an alias such that
every time someone uses it, they get a message about "joe" being the
new and preferred address and to please use that one in the future.
Consult your documentation for details.

Do you have a central mail server with a /var/spool/mail where ALL the
mail gets delivered? If this spool directory is not available on the
clients, then how do the user read their email? Obviously not on the mail
server, since you say that the home directories are not available there.
(Am I reading your message completely wrong here?)

Our setup is a bit weird -- we have machines in 2 different locations with
a rather reasonably large latency link in between (and can be flaky at 
times), so mounting /var/spool/mail is out. We've chosen, rather, to route
all incoming messages via a set of MX'd central mail servers (via sendmail
alias map) to the machine that serves user's home directory and then have 
procmail deliver it locally to their home directories. No NFS locking 
nightmares and the users have no problem running procmail or other filtering
agents (such as slocal) via their .forward entries after the local delivery 
is done. It turned out to be extremely stable and scalable as we add/remove
users and add/remove file servers where users are served from. We simply
don't have to deal with /var/spool/mail (or /var/mail) anymore and it's a
good thing! There were about a list of dozen or so gotchas we had to deal
with, but it was easy and done over a weekend. For sites that don't allow
.forward (for security reasons or what not), user's can simply write
procmail wrappers that wait for mail arrival to their MAILBOX and deal
with it accordingly (either wake up every so often or work like biff).

     I'm having a bit of a problem running Pine 3.91 on a Convex C240 
version 11.0 of the OS.  Everything seems to work correctly except 
when I exit Pine it gives the message:

Error resetting signals: Interrupted system call

It gives this message for debug level <7, but not for debug level >=7.
This message is generated in the signals.c code in the pine directory,
but its not obvious to me what the debug level has to do with generating
this message.  Has anyone run into this problem before?  Thanks!

It occurs with MIME incompatability, especially on lists. How can you

This is the default action (signature-at-bottom) for reply, but not for
forwarding which I think is what you really meant.

I don't think there is a simple setup option to do this.  I believe it is
done this way to distinguish a forwarded message from a reply.  Forwarded
messages are not quoted.  There is probably some RFC out there which says
to do it this way.  If you really need to do this, you could get fancy
with editor macros.

You're on the right track.  If you use the c-client API, you could
support both local and IMAP mailboxes, since c-client has all that stuff
in it.

You probably do *not* want to write your own locking code if you can avoid
it.  If you want to hear why, take me to the nearest pub, order a pitcher
of beer, and hear the tale of sorrow and woe... ;-)  Anyway, yes, if you
only use IMAP then you won't have any locking to worry about.

You don't need an SMTP gateway, but do you do need an SMTP server
somewhere to talk to.  If your PC is on the Internet, almost any system
will do, but you should probably pick a machine that is local to you
(e.g. your local UNIX machine).

You tell PC-Pine which server to use by setting the smtp-server
configuration parameter.

PC-Pine for Windows tries to print in the same font and size as the
text appears on your screen.  "WhatYouSeeIsWhatYouGet" You should be
able to hold the printed page over the window and find the text is
exactly the same size.  If it does not match then this is not a
perfect world.  Either windows lies about some screen dimensions or I
am an inadequate windows programmer.

Try increasing the font size in the pine window then print again.
Perhaps you can find a font that is acceptable both on the screen and
the page.  If you have some unusual screen resolution set up that may
be what causes the discrepancy.

The next version will allow you to independantly set the window font
and the printer font.

BTW.  I don't remember a "Setup|Printer" under a "Main Menu"

What you want is IMAP4 with IMSP capability.  IMSP allows a centralized 
server to hold configuration options (such as addressbooks, Pine 
defaults, etc.) which a mail client can download to configure itself to a 
given user.

Unfortunately, it isn't really available today except in very beta form.  
Look for it later this year, or check out 
http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/cyrus/cyrus for information about an 
ongoing IMAP4/IMSP project.

Listproc (characterized by the "To: Multiple recipients of" header) in
particular rips out all headers and replaces them with its own.  This
means that if you have a MIME-encoded message, you have to guess at its
type, and if you have a MIME multipart message you have to recreate the
boundary-encoding, which is obscure.  It's a hairy problem, but there's 
nothing you can do to get the list processor to behave differently.  
(Maybe a message to listserv with 'SET LIST xxx DWIM'? ;)

The powers-that-be where I work have asked me to look at a utility called 
"munpack" which is supposed to extract MIME messages from text, even with 
corrupt headers (but that's only what a powers-that-be committee has told 
me, I don't know if it's true :).   ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/mpack/.

The =20 on the end of the line is the "quoted-printable"  representation of a blank.
Since some mail transport agents strip trailing blanks the mime capable user agent
used quoted-printable to make sure they were not stripped.  Programs are dumb
so they have to assume that it it's there it must be important.

Ack, nak!  Don't ask for that! That ain't a feature, that's a bug.  With
20,000 users (most of whom are undergraduates), I probably get two or
three complaints from faculty who have gotten suspicious email of which
the supposed sender later denied authorship.   And usually it isn't 
unattended terminal syndrome, either, but kids who have figured out how 
to use /usr/lib/sendmail or telnet localhost smtp.

I spend enough time already consoling those profs and explaining to them 
how the big wide Net works.  If Pine had a *configuration option* for 
forging messages, I wouldn't have time to do anything else!

Hi,

I was wondering if there was a way to select multiple names from the
address book?  For example, I'm forwarding something to 3 people, I hit
^T to get to the address book, and then 'S' or enter to select the
address.  Then I have to go back to the address book, etc, etc.

Now, I understand that I can just type the nicknames; that's what
they're there for after all, right?  My problem is I usually find
something interesting and go thru my book and say, "who would also find
this interesting".

TIA!

X-Status: 

I am having a problem with Pine 3.90 on Solaris for x86 version 2.4.
When I send mail to a local user (ie put only the username in the to:
field), pine drops the hostname from the domain. In other words, if I
put in "root", Pine expands it to "root@acs-lc.depaul.edu" instead of
"root@teacher.acs-lc.depaul.edu". I have specified the following in
/usr/local/lib/pine.conf.fixed:

user-domain=teacher.acs-lc.depaul.edu

And I have taken the user-domain directive out of
/usr/local/lib/pine.conf. I have also tried this with and without the
use-only-domain-name set.

Can anyone suggest to me how I might be able to fix this? The box on
which Pine is running is going to be for relatively unsophisticated
users, and I don't want to make them have to type the whole domain
name if I can help it.

Thanks

Subject: How to use any spell-checker you like
Date: 7 May 1995 22:27:37 GMT
Message-Id: <3ojhgp$1gh1@bigblue.oit.unc.edu>
Status: O
X-Status: 

Assuming you have access to a shell prompt and the
'enable-alternate-editor-cmd' and 'editor' Pine config variables
aren't fixed at your site, using any old spell check program you damn
well please isn't a problem.

The reason is that spell-checkers qualify as "editors", in that they
take the file whose name they were given on the command line and
change it, then save it back in place.  Spell checkers like Ispell are
simply specialized editors.  There are many other examples of such
things; PGP encryption can also be used in such a fashion.

So, you can make use of this fact to allow you to use any spell
checker, editor, encryptor, etc.--without having to constantly change
your Pine configuration.

What you do is this:

1. Do you have a "bin" directory in your home directory? If not,
   create one (cd ; mkdir bin). Add it to your PATH or path
   environment variable:

   a. Edit .cshrc, .profile, .bashrc, or .zshenv (which one you edit
      depends on your shell; probably whichever you see when you do an
      "ls -a" is the right one).  Look for a line, very early on in
      the file, that has "path" or "PATH" in it.  It may look
      something like this:

      setenv PATH /bin:/usr/bin:/usr/ucb:/usr/local/bin

      or like this:

      PATH=/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/opt/bin:/usr/local/bin

      or even like this:

      path=( /bin /usr/local/bin /sbin . )

      If the line has a PATH in all caps, then there will be colons
      in between the values, if lowercase path then spaces.  Make sure
      to leave colons or spaces between each value, and stay inside
      the parentheses if they're there.

   b. When you've found a line like the above, go to the end (if there
      is a dot [.] right at the end, insert right before that dot) and
      add $HOME/bin (if you're editing a .profile) or ~/bin (if you're
      editing anything else).  Make sure to add a colon if necessary!

   c. Save your file and log out and back in to let the changes take
      effect.

2. Now, go into your bin directory (cd bin), and create a new file.  I
   call mine editi, you can call yours whatever you like.  Put the
   following lines in the file:

#!/bin/ksh
read editor?"Editor?>> "
exec $editor $*

   Make sure that the #! line is the *first* line of the file! (If
   you don't have the KornShell available on your site, you can try
   the following Perl script instead:

#!/usr/bin/perl
print "Editor?>> ";
chop(($editor=<STDIN>));
exec "$editor", @ARGV;

   which should work just as well.  If you have neither, then I feel
   sorry for you. :) [Actually, you can do this in any language.]

3. Save the file.  Then type

chmod 755 <filename>

   to give the file executable, i.e. "program", status.

4. Go into pine.  In Setup/Configuration options, find
   "enable-alternate-editor-cmd" and check it if it isn't already.
   Then, right down near the bottom of the options, there's one called
   "editor".  Change its value to be "editi" (or whatever you called
   the thing you just created).

5. Now, when you need to use any sort of "editor" other than Pico,
   just press control-underscore while composing.  You'll get the
   "Editor?>>" prompt, and you can type the name of any editor you
   want, including ispell, emacs, or whatever.  You can give it
   arguments as you please, i.e. "ispell -t". The only restriction is
   that the editor must take the file it is editing as its last
   argument.

Have fun!

    Yet one more time.  Pine itself does not do mail filtering.  It can
use the _results_ of mail filtering done by another program, such as
procmail on Unix.  For instance, I use procmail to pick out mailings from
one listserv into a separate folder readable by Pine.  It is done quietly,
so to speak, even when I am not logged on.  In this case, however, all
mailings come from one or the other of two specific userids.  Whether you
can adapt it to your situation I don't know.  Nancy McGough's mail
filtering FAQ has lots of good information and instructions.  I was able
to set up procmail easily just by following a recipe.  The FAQ is
available at: 

    [USENET newsgroup:] news.answers
    ftp://ftp.halcyon.com/pub/ii/internet/filtering_mail_faq.txt
    ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/mail/filtering-faq

(If you do not have access to these resources, I can email you a copy.)

    It is probably possible to do what you want to do.  It's just a 
question of finding the right resources and documentation to do the job.  
The filtering FAQ is a good place to start.

You're suffering from a very common misunderstanding of the way the list
distribution programs work.  The misunderstanding is because it is
initially counterintuitive, but once you think about it, I think you'll 
understand.

You see, when we talk about email that we have received because we are on
a list, we say, "oh, I just got mail from the ziffle-bang list".  But
really, the ziffle-bang list didn't write anything.  A *person*, say Jane
Smith from Kenosha, sent that mail, and in actuality the mail is *from*
Jane.  All the ziffle-bang list did was propogate it to many different 
people, much the same as if you had received the mail yourself and 
bounced it to a bunch of your friends.

It's not the From header that is important in determining whether the 
mail is coming from a list, it's the *TO* header.  What you really want 
to know is not who the mail is from, but whether it is to you, or to you 
and ten thousand of your closest pals on the ziffle-bang list.

This always surprises me when I hear people struggling with this 
backwards way of doing things, mostly because I've been using and running 
lists for so long that this seems only natural.  But if you think about 
it, from the list's point of reference, this *is* natural.  The mail is 
coming *from* Jane.  It's going *to* the list, which you happen to be 
on.  Lists aren't publications, but it's easy to fall into the trap of 
thinking of them as such.

So, check the To line instead of the From line.  Better yet (and this is 
what I do because it's so easy) look to the left of the numbers in your 
folder index.  Mail to a list should have only the "N" for new messages.  
But mail that is specifically to you should have a plus next to it, too.  
If it doesn't, then that's something that should be fixed in Pine 3.92.  
But probably it works, and you just haven't noticed the little plus sign.

Well, if that's the way I should think of it, then that's how I will,
I'm easy.  But I have 'ta tell 'ya, it's not how I see it.  When I
recieve a magazine in the mail, say, Smithsonian, or Wired, Mad (my
favorite) or whatever, there are lots of contributing articles to the
gist of the magazine.  These articles are not "from" so-&-so, they're
"by" so-&-so, and they're not sent to "me" they're sent to the
magazine.  I receive so-&-so's article "from" the magazine, not from
so-&-so.

Consequently, where I use Internet services that don't present an index
of mail via Pine, I get an Inbox that might look like this:

    ADA-LAW@vm1.nodak             Filing deadlines
    outdoor-L@ulkyvm              trash bins          
    outdoor-L@ulkyvm              RE: trash bins           
    Shannon Brody                 Hi, Dad
    ODP-L@tamvm1                  Slant drilling mishap

Whereas via Pine:

    Brent Wilson                  Filing deadlines
    Ellen Smith                   trash bins          
    Scott McIntyre                RE: trash bins           
    Shannon Brody                 Hi, Dad
    Bill Whitman                  Slant drilling mishap

And when I have many Inbox screens filled with sometimes hundreds of
mails arrived, it's just much easier to note the real source of the
mail, the list, to distinguish what's what and from where.  From "whom"
is not the source lest it's a personal email and to present just a
person's name doesn't help when it's coming from a listserv because the
mail is really not "to me."  So I respectfully disagree with your view
as to the origin of an email. 

>So, check the To line instead of the From line. 

But the To line is not what's listed in my Inbox index screen, the
person the mail is from is what's listed.  OTOH, if there's a Pine
setting that will show me the To: line rather than the From: line when
I view my Inbox index, then perhaps that's precisely what I'm after and
I haven't configured Pine properly to do it.

Now we're in sync.  I was over-looking this and indeed you're right,
the plus sign distinguishes personal email and I thank you for the tip
(I wonder if I can perform a sort that will organize personal email
from everything else; anyway, no matter, looking for the plus sign is
very helpful, thanks).

Remains, however, to be able to distinguish various listserv mailings
but in fact I'm not as concerned about that now that I'm reminded of
the efficacy of the plus sign.  Thanks for the reply.

    It sounds to me as if you have full headers toggled on when you do the
export.  When you are viewing an item in Pine, try pressing the 'h' key a
couple of times and watch what happens to the headers.  The export command
writes out full headers or not depending on the status of the headines,
full or not.  It works for me with Unix Pine 3.91.

Define the problem: I subscribe to many listservs, but when respective
mail arrives, all I see as far as sender is concerned is a person's name
(or ename, whatever).  I *do not* see that it's from xyz listserv.
Consequently my inbox, newmail, etc., is inundated with hundreds of
mailings daily and I have no way of telling if an email is via listserv
or something specifically sent to me one-to-one.  Subject info isn't
necessarily helpful in differentiating listserv from personal email.

So I simply must be able to separate mail if only visually in order to
spot personal email from listserv and/or junk email.  Some services I've
used in the past list listserv mail as sent from the listserv, not by
name of who wrote the note, followed by subject/thread info.  That makes
it very easy to tell which is from which listserv or if personal email.
But I'm not able to do that with Pine.

Suggestions/instructions/documentation on how to fix this problem will
be most appreciated.  I read a faq on filtering, by Nancy McGough, but
the instructions do not work via many ISP's, including this one,
Primenet.  No fixit suggestions from her end and evasive techno-
gibberish from Primenet's end as to why her .forward file's string
doesn't work here, etc., etc., etc.

So I need help on this because I find myself either subscribing to
different services just to subscribe to a single listserv thus always
knowing which mail is which, or unsubscribing from listservs because I
just can't distill personal email from hundreds of listserv posts when
everything is presented by personal sender name.

Clearly (no pun intended, well, maybe so <g>) there's got to be an
expeditious way to deal with this.  I frustratingly seek your experience
if you've figured it out.

    Sure, LISTSERV does include the possiblilty to get mail with full
headers.  Unfortunately, it's not the default, and likewise, anyone in
need of full headers (for MIME awareness) must issue this command.

The  following letter was written by a participating member in this
program.

To those with the COMMON sense to participate in this easy money
opportunity:

     About six months ago I received the enclose letter, I ignored it.  I 
received about five more of the same letter within the next two week.I 
ignored them also.  Of course, I was tempted to follow
through and dreamed of making thousands, but I was convinced it was just 
another gimmick and could not possibly work.

I was wrong!  About three weeks later I saw this same letter posted on a 
ignored it.  I received about five more of the same letter within the 
next two weeks and I ignored them also.  Of course, I was tempted to 
follow through and dreamed of making thousands, but I was convinced it 
was just another gimmick and could not possibly work.

I was wrong!  About three weeks later I saw this same letter posted on a 
local bulletin board in Phoenix.  I liked the idea of giving it a try 
with my computer.  I didn't expect much because I figured, if other 
people wereas skeptical as I, they would not be too quick to part with
$5.00.  But, I BUY LOTTERY TICKETS WEEKLY IN MY STATE AND HAVE NOTHING TO 
SHOW FOR IT BUT TICKET STUBS!  This week I decided to look at this as my 
weekly lottery
purchase.  I addressed the envelopes and mailed out $1.00 in each as 
directed. Two weeks went by and I didn't receive anything in the mail.
The fourth week rolled around and I couldn't believe what happened!  I 
can not say that I received $50,000.00, but it was definitely well over 
$35,000.00!  For the first time in 10 years I got out of debt.  It was 
great.  Of course, it did not take me long to go through my earnings, so 
I am using this excellent money opportunity once again.  FOLLOW THE 
INSTRUCTIONS AND GET READY TO ENJOY!
Please send a copy of this letter along with the enclosed letter so together
we can convince people who are skeptical that this is no gimmick!

                                                       Good Luck,

 Hey....
  I'm one of the people who downloaded this awhile ago, and I've made 
quite a profit...not 50,000 dollars, but TONS more than the 5 bucks I 
sent in.  It might take more than 60 days to get 50,000, but I think I 
can wait.

I'm not the PC guy, but when I ask him about that he says this:
He's not sure what you mean by 'stack'. I assume that it is the protocol 
layers or something like that - tcp/ip sits on top of something else, etc.
APparently, there seem to be two stacks, one that comes with windows and 
one that the Novell network uses. (Windows 3.11, Novell Lan Workplace for 
DOS 4.2). The order of loading seems to be: Novell stack (ipx), then tcp, 
then windows (netbui). From there we try to run Pine.

Any help at all?

	In Pine3.91 while reading e-mail use the following commands:

	1) "V"iewAttch command 
        2) "S"ave function 
	3) "E"xit Viewer
	
	This only exports the body of the message to a file no matter 
	what the status is of the headers are (ie: Rich or Suppressed).
	
	Hope this helps!

Hi!

Is it possibile to configure Pine to send mails in the background as is in Elm.
Now while sending a mail I have to wait until the "Sending mail..." message
disappears. 

Any helps appreciated.

Try to use command 'v'(view) and save as an attachment, there would be no 
header in your saved file at all.

A "little" awkward??  I've got more than a dozen listservs to deal
with.  I'm familiar with the approach you mention but I'm not one who
gets off on fondling my keyboard.  I just wanna see what mail I've got,
especially in the morning when I first check for anything urgent before
going about my business.  OTOH, I've been thinking my PC's comm program
has a fine scripting language and I might very well be able to automate
the procedure you've outlined.  I use its scripting language for
automating a number of online actions.  I think I can massage it for
this purpose as well.  

Ideally, I'd just like to see listserv mail amid real email show up
like this:

      outdoor-l             (size)     new campsites
      outdoor-l             (size)     trail bikes
      biotech               (size)     a breakthrough
      law-net               (size)     tort reform
      law-net               (size)     RE: tort reform
      Jessica Brody         (size)     I need $$, Pop
      archeaology-l         (size)     scrolls translation

etc.  While I appreciate what was said about how another views lists
mail, I view 2-way lists as a kind of interactive magazine.  I would
like to see my mail listed by way of the list and of course respective
article subjects.  Probably no need to have more than the list's name
which prefixes the @ sign.  I'm afraid I can't see this as any simpler
or easier to distinguish which mail is which at instant glance.  The
previous explanation given me as to how listserv mail should be
considered simply strikes me as time consuming if not arcane.

etc.

Try this:
Go into Setup.  Choose configure.  Activate the aggegate command
option.  Exit Pine, then go back in.
 
When you display your list of mail, press the semi-colon key,
which is the select command.  When you are asked for criteria,
choose T (text), then A (all text), then key in the name of
one of your listservs.
 
Then press A (apply next command to all selected mail).
Then you can either save all selected messages to another folder,
or you can export to a file in your home directory.
 
I use export.  Since I have communication software on my PC with
buffer capture to disk, I exit Pine, go to shell, turn on buffer
capture,then cat the file I exported to.   Then I read the stuff
off line.
 
A little awkward, but when Pine comes out with a scripting ability
it will be just fine.
 
Phil

    In this case you want Pine to display your index not by the From: field,
but rather by the Sender: field (wherein the LISTSERV name can be found).
Doesn't appear to be an option to select this, although you can select how
messages should be saved -- whether by the list name, or by the author: the
former corresponds to the by-sender rule, and the latter to by-from.

    I agree that it would be a desirable feature for one to select whether
the Sender: or the From: field is displayed in the index, and maybe the Pine
team will add this to 3.92, to give you the behavior shown above.

One of our users gets "bug detected in pine" when trying to edit a 
certain field (Fullname) in his address book.  I asked him to send 
(e-mail) me a copy of of the addressbook.  I received the following 
addressbook (via mail) from him.  

I saved the addressbook as a "new addressbook", added the new addressbook
filename to my addressbook list, started pine, went into Addressbook and
tried to change the Fullname of the 2nd entry.  I too get the "BUG
detected" in pine.

Dear sirs and madames,
	I have tried to get an answer to this question from the 
University of Oregon computer center but they tell me "we don't know 
anything about PC-Pine; we only know about Pine, sorry."
	My problem is this.  About two or three months ago my Pine 
program began automatically saving sent mail.  I don't like this--it 
fills up my mailbox.  I have discovered on my own that there is a way to 
turn this off (put the message default-fcc="" in the configuration file), 
but I cannot find out how to modify this file.
	Would be be so kind as to tell me what I must do to turn off this 
function?  I am using Pine 3.89.  Please help me.  Thanks

Yes.  The uuencoded file is ASCII, so you can Export the message and 
uudecode the file on your Unix host or with the DOS version of uudecode, 
which I have attached to this message.

This is why there is a Reply-To field.  Either edit your .pinerc
file to add that to the customized-hdrs variable, or use the Setup-Config
command to add the customized header.

If I were to add this, it might look like this in the .pinerc:

customized-hdrs=Reply-To: james@sagarmatha.com

This would only work if the Linux and DOS machines are two different
computers.  If that's the case, just use IMAP to keep the folders on the
Linux machine (Folder-path: {linux.my.net}mail/).

If you switch the machine from Linux to/from DOS, there may not be a way
to have Pine share folders between the two OSs.  If Linux can mount a
DOS filesystem, that may be the way to go - keep your Linux folders on
the DOS partition, then both Pines can get them.

I understand your concern re: deceptive e-mail and the problems it presents you 
as a system administrator.  It was certainly not my intent to encourage 
forgery.  However, for people who have more than one address at which they can 
receive e-mail, it would be convenient to set the return address at one 
location to the other address, so that all return mail came to one location.  
Thus, there is a "legitimate" use for such a feature.

People who want to decieve will find a way, even if Pine doesn't offer it.  
Spry's AIR Mail program for Windows, which is what I normally use, allows you 
to set your return address to anything you want, so anyone with a PC can 
generate a message with any return address they want.

Heck, for that matter, you can send a typewritten letter through the postal 
mail with someone else's name and return address.  The world is an unsafe 
place.

To get back to my original question, it would appear from your response that 
Pine does not have a configuration option for setting the username on the 
return address.  Thank you for that information.

Matthew,
   The way user-domain works was changed in Pine 3.91.  Prior to that
there were some quirks with the way it worked, and you're probably
running into one of those quirks.  With 3.91, if you set user-domain that
is what you'll get.  So the suggestion is to upgrade to 3.91.  Thanks.

Status: O
X-Status: 

I've just started using pine (version 3.89 on an rs/6000 running AIX 3.2.5) 
and notice two curious delays:

 - after mail arrives (according to xbiff), it takes several minutes
   for this to register with pine's INBOX display

 - whenever pine senses a new mail message or some other event occurs,
   the pine window seems to freeze for about 10-15 seconds during which
   time one cannot, for example, continue composing a new outgoing mail
   message.

My main question is whether this behavior is unique to my system, is 
inherent to pine, or whether it reflects some internal parameter 
setting(s) that can be changed to eliminate these delays.

Other Qs:
 - is there a way to automatically create a monthly file of received
   messages (analogously to the way sent messages are handled)?
 - is there a reason I should try to get a new version of pine
   installed? (Is there a newer version for the rs/6000?)


Please respond by email as it is difficult for me to carefully monitor
this news group.

  Thank you for your help!

   I'm playing around with a mailing list "server" config using IMAP and

It should take around two and a half minutes at maximum (but a watched 
kettle never boils).  Press control-L to get Pine to check immediately.

Get Pine version 3.91.  (But be careful of the pine-interrupted-mail bug, 
it happens a lot under AIX! Just remember if you get weird errors about 
having a postponed composition, but not having anything to continue, just 
'rm .pine-interrupted*' in your home directory.)

>Other Qs:

Um...

export EDITOR=/usr/local/bin/pico
  (or setenv EDITOR /usr/local/bin/pico, whichever works)
crontab -e

0 0 1 * * (cd $HOME/mail ; mv saved-messages $(date +saved-messages-\%b-\%Y))

[save]

Then at midnight on the first of every month, saved-messages becomes 
saved-messages-Month-Year, just like sent-mail.  Unfortunately, by this 
method, your May messages will be marked June, June July, and so on.  Maybe

59 23 31 * * (cd...

except that will not work in February, April, May, September, and 
November.  (Ouch, this is getting difficult!)

You could always write a Perl script called backdate:

#!/usr/bin/perl
# backdate--simple date formatter running a month slow
%convert_months=('Jan','Dec',
                 'Feb','Jan',
                 'Mar','Feb',
                 'Apr','Mar',
                 'May','Apr',
                 'Jun','May',
                 'Jul','Jun',
                 'Aug','Jul',
                 'Sep','Aug',
                 'Oct','Sep',
                 'Nov','Oct',
                 'Dec','Nov');
$_ = "@ARGV"; # load $_ with arguments separated by a space
($lastMonth, $year) = (split(/[:\n]/, `date +%b:%Y`));
$month = $convert_months{$lastMonth}; 
s#\+(.*)%b(.*)#\1$month\2#; # interpolate %b to be last month
s#(.*)%Y(.*)#\1$year\2#; # interpolate %Y to be this year
print "$_\n"; # print the durned thing
__END__

(This is not an example of Good Perl Coding.  It's ugly, probably no one 
understands it but me, but hey, I wrote in in sixty seconds, and it 
works, so who cares?)

Then, you can rewrite the crontab as:

0 0 1 * * (cd $HOME/mail; mv saved-messages `backdate +saved-messages-%b-%Y`)

And that'll do what you want.  Don't forget to include the full pathname 
for backdate unless you want to stick it in /usr/bin!  (phew!)

More features, greater stability, faster mailbox opening...the only 
reason to stay away is the interrupted mail thing.

Hope I was some help and didn't send you running for the hills screaming

It is possible to compile Pine so that user's can use the 
customized-hdrs variable to customized the From header.
I don't think this would allow real forgery since other
headers, like Sender, will give clues about the "true"
sender.

Nancy (using a fake From header with nn right now!)

He is on a SPARC with Sun OS and Pine 3.90.  His INBOX contains over 3000
messages.  (I'm trying to convince him to do some wholesale deleting and
saving.)  It's my gut feeling that his anomoly is caused by the large 
number of messages in the INBOX.

Can anyone tell me what is happening?

    And a good field it is.  Unfortunately, it can't be counted on 100% of
the time to get your replies sent where you want them to go.  Take the
pine-info mailing list -- if I post to Usenet, like here, the Reply-To:
field I insert here is not passed through the gateway to the mail recipients.
Likewise the mail participants with Reply-To: headers fail to have them
seen by news.
    That's a minor problem, but perhaps more serious are those gateways
which fail to attach importance to this header, which includes a number of
X.400 to SMTP gateways.  I've been trying to figure out why I don't seem
to communicate with a particular victim on the other side of an X.400 mail
system, and I've just discovered that it's pretty common for replies to go
to the From: address in SMTP rather than the Reply-To: address when those
replies originate on an X.400 system.
    This would be a minor problem were I not to be hacking on machines that
don't exist in DNS with logins I don't have with any ISP.  Try to find
root@squeamish.ossifrage.msen.com if you like.
    And of course, if someone chooses to reply to the From: header...

    I'm not advocating a configurable From: field for all, because the
Reply-To: field should work.  I just want to alert people to some cases
where broken software prevents it from working as intended.

   This is essentially the frequent question about filtering mail based on 
criteria so that mailing list messages go one way and regular, "personal 
mail" messages go another.  As has been noted, there are various ways to 
accomplish this *outside* of Pine, which does not do mail filtering by 
itself.  Unfortunately you did not say what kind of system you are 
running on (Unix, PC-Pine, whatever), and the techniques will differ 
accordingly.  (If you are on Unix and have procmail available, it should 
be fairly easy, although I have not experimented to see whether procmail 
can process based on a "Reply-to: line.)  Nancy McGough's mail filtering 
FAQ is a good place to start.  It is available at:

    ftp://ftp.halcyon.com/pub/ii/internet/filtering_mail_faq.txt
    ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/mail/filtering-faq

(Send me an email if you have problems getting hold of it.)

   When our users print an e-mail message from pine to an 
"attached-to-ansi" printer (some local and some network printers - most 
of them laser) two problems occur. 

   1)  For messages which exceed one page, a line is normally lost as the
printer does the formfeed.

   2)  An extra page is printed at the end with.  It either has "[4i" on 
it or is blank (yes, formfeed is turned off and pine is the only application 
which gives the extra blank page)

  
   Any helps or hints would be appreciated.  Thanks in Advance!

I have Pine 3.91 installed on a PC running Linux. I am using Pine to read and 
post news with a nntp server I have access to. How can I set the Organization: 
header that gets posted with the news article? It does not pickup the 
organization from my /etc directory and I've also tried a setenv Organization. 
What shows up is the organization for my nntp server, which is not what I 
want.

Most mail that comes from a mailing list has not only a "From:"
line in the header but also a ":Reply to:" line.

Could this fact be used to sort the private mail received by Pine from 
the mail coming via a mailing list.

I want to read the mailing list mail, that is why I subscribe to the 
mailing list, but it would be nice to read my private mail first. 

Also might it be possible to group all mail from one mailing list together?

The ultimate would be an incoming mail file with personal mail first 
followed by mailing list mail grouped by mailing lists.

Is that possible? How?

Thank you for any help

You all posted some nice info on mail headers & pine but if I understand 
the question right it's how do you filter ?

In the pine docs & manual it says you gotta get another software to 
filter & most sites offer the elm filter (at the Unix prompt type 
which filter) I set up a filter to send my listEmail to different folders 
to separate my work Email from my list Email. If you are interested in 
the gory details send me Email & I'll send you the how-tos.

Speaking for Pine 3.91, select the files you want to save with the select 
command (;), which must be enabled in the pine configuration file (main 
menu Setup Configuration).  Select based on your requirements.  For 
example, to select all messages from pine-info:
;   select
t   text
a   all
pine-info<ret>

The save to a folder:

a   apply
s   save
pine<ret>

Then delete them (if you do not have delete on save enabled)

a   apply
d   delete

Then expunge

x   expunge

You do all this from the index.

Goo luck.

See, that's the clincher.  It isn't coming *from* a listserv, it's coming 
*from* Brent Wilson and Ellen Smith and Scott McIntyre, just like "Hi, 
Dad" is coming from Shannon Brody.

The difference is that in some mail-user agents, if the To: line is not
specifically to you (and the Cc: line also is not specifically to you)
then the index field that usually shows "From" shows To: instead.  Another
possibility is that the mail-user agent you're used to uses the "From "
line rather than the "From:" header (which is actually strictly against 
RFC822, since the "From " line is a Unix convention rather than anything 
having to do with the mail-transport protocols).

Either way, it's really a matter of preference, but I prefer the way Pine 
does it because if I'm on, say, the Perl Developers list, I'd definitely 
want to immediately read a post from Larry Wall, the author of Perl, 
entitled "New feature for Perl?".  I wouldn't feel the same immediacy to 
read a post with the same subject line from someone I've never heard of, 
since they're probably just making a suggestion.

Perhaps choosing the behavior (either a toggle button to switch between 
To: lines and From: lines, or a pine config variable that would allow the 
user to pick between the above behaviors) would be a nice addition to Pine?

Well, yes.  I didn't mean you should *look* at the To: header with your 
eyes per se, just "look" at it with whatever tools.  So, for instance 
(assuming you have enable-aggregate-command-set checked in your config 
variables), you can type ";" (Select), "T" (Text), "T" (To), 
"ziffle-bang" (name of list), <return>, "Z" (Zoom), and now you'll see 
all the messages in the ziffle-bang list.

Just keep doing the above for each list, and you can read each list in 
sequence rather than all jumbled together.  To select your personal mail, 
just type "brody" instead of a list name in the above.

Hallo!

Is it possible to change the severity (I am not sure if it is a proper
word) of ipopd so that I can define a different log file for ipopd in
syslog.conf? Thanks a lot for any answer.

In ipop2d.c and ipop3d.c, you can change the openlog() calls from
LOG_MAIL to some other facility.  Do "man 3 syslog" for more information
on how to go about doing this.

I can't seem to get filter to execute multiple commands.

if bla bla bla then execute " (cli command) "

That's the syntax basically, so if I do this, it executes both commands:

execute "echo test1 > test.txt;echo test2 >> test.txt"

but if I do this it only executes the first half:

execute "cat - > reply.txt;reply"

(in this case, - means it sends the body of the message, and reply is a 
cli script file)

The reason this is important is I'm trying to build a pseudo-mailing 
list, and when you post, it will save the post to a file, then run a 
script that emails that text file to everyone on the list.  I can't just 
run a script because I can't reference the body of the incoming message 
from within the script, only from within the execute quotes (well I'll 
give it a shot but I doubt it'll work).

Any solutions?

Actually I think it started out meaning "Pine Is Nearly Elm"
and then became "Program for Internet News & Mail."  Some history
is at Laurence's Home Page: Naming Pine:

        http://oneworld.wa.com/laurence/pine.html

I like "Pine is Nicer than Elm" because I think it is (and I used Elm
for many years).

Is there some configuration I could do to use other functions in Pine

OK pine experts, I need help. I have a Sales/Marketing weenie in my
office who uses a Mac and doesn't understand good 'ole command line
'mail'. So I have told him to use 'pine'. This works OK for  reading
mail, but pine wants to stick our domain name on all sent messages. Our
domain name is 'novatec', so all this guy's Reply-to: addresses are
dave@novatec. For mail sent outside our domain, we use a uucp mail
server via dialup. With regular mail, return addresses on the mail are
just the user name (no domain) and either sendmail, or the remote mail
server knows to put @novatec.ascinet.com on the end of the user name to
create the return address. However, it seems that if there is already a
domain name on the return address, that name is kept.

So, bottom line is this. When I send mail to a local user on our domain
using 'mail', the From address is:

    mfoley

and when I send this message to a remote user the From address is:

    mfoley@novatec.ascinet.com

When our sales guy using pine sends to a local user the From address is:

    dave@novatec

and when he sends to a remote user the From address is also:

    dave@novatec

Needless to say, any mail of Dave's which is replyed to bounces. How do I
fix this? I have tried changing user-domain and use-only-domain-name in
the .pinerc file with no effect. In fact, I always get

user-domain=

when I do pine -conf, regardless of what I set the value to. I do not
have a system-wide pinerc, even though the pine -conf says I do in 
/usr/local/lib/pine.conf (this file doesn't exist).

What's my problem? Please email advice.

crashing.  I've witnessed it while in the composer and getting MORE than 
one letter.  The first letter notifies properly, but any letters after 
that cause the crash.

Hi- How do I go about setting up an automated reply to mail from a 
particular address. For instance, if "president@whitehouse.gov" regularly 
flames me and I want to send an auto reply (that I specify) everytime my 
account gets mail from this address. Is this possible?

Ok, I found out the culpret.  Oddly enough, having a symbolic link from
'mail' to anothr directory is what the problem was.  You may want to
check into it anyway, as I'm sure others are having the same problem.
Pine 3.91 works fine for me now that I use mail (as specified in my
config).  :)

Someone mailed me mentioning that the Perl script I posted had a bug in
that in January 1996 it would save the file as "saved-messages-Dec-1996". 
Someone else mentioned that I should have switched the names of the
$lastMonth and $month variables. Sheesh, you people are impossible! :) But
here's a fix...(I am not supporting this thing.  You learn Perl and
support it yourself. :)

#!/usr/bin/perl

I have probably overlooked this someplace, but as a new user of pine, I 
would like to know if there is a way to cut large portions of text from a 
message reply, or fwd, rather than one page at a time... And a way to go 
to the end of a message from any point.

Thanks...

I'm still using Linux (1.2.4), and this problem is causing me to resurt

Let me know what I should do...

Message-Id: <3or8ma$5lo@knot.queensu.ca>
Status: O
X-Status: 

Has anyone else had a problem with PINE arbitrarily marking messages for
deletion?  

When leaving one folder and opening another I am asked if I want to delete
one or two messages from the last folder I was in.  I have not requested
that these messages be deleted, and in many instances it is not that I
have even so much as moved the cursor onto the message to look at it. 
This problem does not occur each time - maybe every 5 or 6 times I move
from one folder to another.  Pine will not delete the file if I say no to
the question and I can go back to the folder and remove the delete
indicator.  This has been happening for about three weeks and the only 
thing that I think I may have changed in that time is that I added 
another editor to my PINE (vi) which I am not using.  

I'm using Pine 3.91 and aix 3.2.5 on an RS6000.  I've asked the more
frequent users of our system and no one else has this problem. I have
about 52 folders.  I do not have a limited disk space, and there is no 
sweap going on on our machine getting rid of old mail (and as I said the 
messages seem to be chosen at random).

Any ideas?

I agree with John's Suggestion. It is very not to be able to change the print
command on the fly. I usually filter my printing through a postscript
formatter, sometimes, I would like to print the file differently. No easy way
now.

Will V3.92 have a capability to do threaded news reading?  It would be 
very useful.

If this is already possible (V3.91) can someone let me know how?

Thanks.

comp.mail.pine is an unmoderated newsgroup which passed its vote for
creation by 421:19 as reported in news.announce.newgroups on 20 May 1994.

For your newsgroups file:
comp.mail.pine		The PINE mail user agent.

The charter, culled from the call for votes:

    This group is for discussion about use and development of the Pine
  mail/news user agent developed by the University of Washington.  Any
  Pine-related and Pine-specific discussion is acceptable, but general
  discussion regarding e.g. MIME or incoming-mail filters is referred to
  other, more appropriate newsgroups.
    The group is not moderated.  To be made moderated, the same procedure
  should be followed as for the creation of a new group at that time.
    The group is bidirectionally gatewayed to the mailing list
  pine-info@cac.washington.edu.

Julie,
There is a mis-feature in Pine 3.91 that if a message is marked deleted 
in your inbox *before* you save it to another folder, the copy of the 
message will also be marked deleted.  (This will be fixed in 3.92)

Would this explain what you are seeing?

Your problem is that you're trying to get Pine to do more than it can (if 
I'm not mistaken as to what you're trying to say).  You need to make some 
sendmail rewrite rules on your Unix host so that it will properly rewrite 
the header on mail going out on your UUCP link.  (If you haven't messed 
with /etc/sendmail.cf files before, then you're in for a TREAT.  I'd 
suggest _sendmail_ (Costales, Allman & Rickert. Sebastopol, CA:O'Reilly, 
1994) to show you how to do it, it's hairy.)

You could try setting user-domain to novatec.ascinet.com, though, but it 
sounds to me like it's a rewrite rule problem.

Hey Terry, I always thought you were the kind of guy who would call a

I think that I have noticed this too.  My conclusion was that if I mark a 
message for deletion in the INBOX and then go back and decide that I 
really wanted to save it to a folder the saved message is still marked 
for deletion.  Could this be true?

The difference is whether the behavior in question is an undesired 
side-effect of a *design* decision, or --in contrast-- a coding error.
In this case, we made a conscious decision to have Save preserve the 
existing message flags.  We were thinking about SEEN/UNSEEN, ANSWERED, etc...
Clearly this was the wrong thing to do in the case of the Deleted flag.

I've searched their web site, and can't find it, though I've seen it
before somewhere.

How does one get pine to access an existing emacs job, instead of
creating an extra emacs when alt editor is invoked?  More importantly,
where do I find it in the docs?  (perhaps it's in emacs, though I've
checked the info files).

Post the answer, send me email, do whatever, I'll get the answer.

Wouldn't a Reply-To: header meet your needs?  If so, Pine's
customized-hdrs feature allows creation of such a header.

It's called emacsserver, and it should be available in 
/usr/local/lib/emacs/X/Y/emacsserver.  I don't know how to run it
though, though it's something that I've been meaning to look at next
week for, oh, about four years now.  If you figure out how to use it,
do drop me a line.

Well, Pine *does* allow you to define custom headers.  So, just add a
"Reply-To", and direct all replies back to your preferred address.  Any
mail program worth its disk space should honor "Reply-To" (or at least
give the user the option to use it.)

   In elm there is a startup flag to only start the mail program

such a flag for pine?  If so can you please email it to me.
(I know pine -z doesn't do it)

I'm in the process of testing 3.91 before replacing 3.87 and discovered
that the "standard-printer" setting in "pine.conf" was ignored.
I found the following reference in the pine-info web and ftp archives, but
no such patch could be found after considerable further digging in the
archives...
So, could someone please send me this patch or let me know where such bug
reports and patches exist ?

thanks,   russell ruby         russ@math.orst.edu

Bet you guys see that a lot :)  Anyway, I am trying to link my news into 
pine because I can't stand the editor that accompanies tin, and because I 
basically prefer pine.  I had it done, but my server somehow managed to 
delete my account, all my mail, and of course my pine config... since 
then I have been trying unsuccessfully to set up a 'newsreader' in pine.  
A friend did it for me last time, and he mentioned that he had set 
something up in pico so that I would be able to access the newsgroups.  I 
have tried all of the things that the pine help suggests, alone or in 
combination, and none have worked.  The auto response to the bug alert 
suggested that I send mail here, I would appreciate any help you could 
give.  Since this is apparently a newsgroup, please reply by email, as I 
cannot actually read news right now :)

Thanks for the help...

Huh?  It doesn't make any difference if Pico is called from tin or from
the shell (which does happen to be "another program ;)

The two options are to invoke sendmail (the default) or to directly
contact an SMTP server (possibly on the same machine).  This is selectable
at runtime in the Pine configuration and does not affect the build.  To
use an SMTP server, set the smtp-server variable in the Setup/Config
screen, /usr/local/lib/pine.conf, or /usr/local/lib/pine.conf.fixed.

How about some instructions on how to have a 'signature' on the bottom

Thanks - a new user.

Dear Netters,

I wander if Pine 3.91 has been ported to Mac platform at all. If so, I'd like
to know if it is available for download and from which archive.
Sorry if it is a FAQ, but I was unable to find any pointer.

Any help or pointer is greatly appreciated.
Thanks in advance

I've used both a lot and really prefer tin; news is what it's dedicated
to.  You can have the best of both worlds by having tin use the PINE
editor (pico)-- set up an environmental variable called VISUAL that
contains the full pathname of pico on your system and tin should use that
instead of vi or whatever.

I am configuring Pine 3.91 for several different types of Unix systems in
our department.  Because we discourage the use of directories in the
/usr/local/ hierarchy, I would like to keep the global configuration file
in a location other than /usr/local/lib/pine.conf.  I had hoped that 
there would be a variable in the makefile to set this but I can't see 
one.  In fact, a grep of the source code directory seems to indicate that 
the name /usr/local/lib/pine.conf occurs as exactly that string in a 
number of locations in the source code and the help files.

Is it the case that using another global configuration file would require 
replacing that string in many different source files?  (Replies via 
e-mail would be appreciated.  I don't know that I will be able to keep up 
with the volume of traffic on this group.)

If that is the case, may I suggest that allowing easy reconfiguration of 
that name could be something to add to the "TO DO" list?

That's the confusing part. We *have* specified the sendmail rules to
tack on the appropriate address going out UUCP. This is how we got
regular 'mail' to work in the first place. Why does it work for 'mail',
but not for 'pine'? I'm confused.

I believe all you need to do is put pine.conf in the same directory
as the binary, certainly it works for me useing a path
/export/internet/pine automounted to /local/pine. If you have paths hard
wired into the source code it might be harder.

	From: "Douglas M. Bates" <bates@stat.wisc.edu>

	I am configuring Pine 3.91 for several different types of Unix systems in
	our department.  Because we discourage the use of directories in the
	/usr/local/ hierarchy, I would like to keep the global configuration file
	in a location other than /usr/local/lib/pine.conf.  I had hoped that 
	there would be a variable in the makefile to set this but I can't see 
	one.  In fact, a grep of the source code directory seems to indicate that 
	the name /usr/local/lib/pine.conf occurs as exactly that string in a 
	number of locations in the source code and the help files.

	Is it the case that using another global configuration file would require 
	replacing that string in many different source files?  (Replies via 
	e-mail would be appreciated.  I don't know that I will be able to keep up 
	with the volume of traffic on this group.)

Pine gurus-

	I use Pine 3.91 for a lot of my computing needs, including 
posting to newsgroups.
	My concern is how to set the special posting fields such as 
Distribution.
	I am fairly certain that this is not available within the 
header.  Is it possible to insert these fields within the body of the 
text and have them still function normally (which I, admittedly, would 
probably classify as a bug), or am I just out of luck until the next 
version of Pine is released?

Thank you for your response.

	-Zach Robinson

Hi!

We are in the process of discontinuing our old VAX/VMS service (scheduled 
to be switched off at the end of June).  Instead all our users are moving 
to UNIX (actually IRIX on SGI boxes) and will be using Pine for their mail.

A lot of people (thankfully) have been making the move over the past year.

However some people have been using the VAX/VMS service right to the 
bitter end, and have a number of mail messages they'd like to "take with 
them" to UNIX.

I was thinking of a little utility that could be used to read the 
messages saved from VAX mail using an "EXTRACT/ALL" command (messages are 
written into a file separated with Line Feeds) and write a Berkeley 
format mailbox.

Then I wondered if anyone had already faced this problem and either 
written such a utility already, or had some other suggestion.

Anyone?  (he said, hopefully! :-)

The command you need is "H" (headers).

Depending on how Pine is configured on your system you may need to go 
into the Setup Configuration menu (S then C from the Main Menu) and 
enable this feature).

No, the heeader lines must be specified in the message header, not the 
message body text.

However all you have to do is add any special headers you want in Pine 
3.91's Setup Configuration menu (S then C from the main menu).  Look for 
the  "customized-hdrs" item.  Here you can set one or more additional 
header fields and, if you wish, a default value to set them to.

You don't normally see these additional header lines when composing a 
message (but they are there).  To see them place the cursor up in the 
message header area and type Ctrl/R to see the "Rich Header".

Note that any header lines you add with default values will almost 
certianly (can't say definitely as I haven't tried it) be used when 
sending either News or e-mail messages.  I tend to just define the header 
line but omit any default value (so the line is omitted from the message 
sent unless you explicitly set a value when composing by Ctrl/R then 
typing in a value).

My Help screen via the setup/configuration menu for sort says this:
       ==========================================

  PINE 3.91   HELP FOR SETUP CONFIGURATION 

        OPTION: Sort-Key

This option determines the order in which messages will be displayed in
the Folder Index screen.  Choose from:

 o Date -- Sort folders according to the date and time they were
     sent. On a folder like INBOX, sorting by "Date" should be almost
     identical to sorting by "Arrival".
 o Arrival -- Sort messages into the order in which they arrived.
 o From -- Sort messages by the name of the author of the message.
     Messages with the same author are grouped together. Groups of
     messages are then put into alphabetical order according to message
     author.
 o Subject -- Sort messages by subject. Messages with the same
     subject are grouped together. Pine ignores leading "Re:" and "re:"
     and trailing "(fwd)" when determining the likeness and
     alphabetical order of subject lines. Groups of messages are put
     into alphabetical order according to subject.
 o OrderedSubj -- Grouping of all messages with the same subject
     into alphabetical order according to subject.
   OrderedSubj -- Grouping of all messages with the same subject
     together is done in the same way as sort by subject. With
     "OrderedSubj" however, groups of messages are put into date order
     according to the oldest message on a given subject. This sorting
     provides pseudo threading of messages.
 o ReverseDate -- Like "Date" but the newest message is first.
 o ReverseArrival -- Like "Arrival" but the newest message is first.
 o ReverseFrom -- Like "From" but groups of messages are ordered in
     reverse alphabetical order (Z-A).
 o ReverseSubject -- Like "Subject" but groups of messages are
     ordered in reverse alphabetical order (Z-A).
 o ReverseOrderedSubj -- Like "OrderedSubj" but groups of messages
     are ordered with the newest groups first (according to the first
     message of each group)

Normal default is "arrival".

<End of help on this topic>
============================================

Another approach of course is to try some of the sort options while
online, via the $ (dollar sign) key to bring up the sort menu.  Then
watch the screen to see how it sorts and if you like the results.  Via
menu key the sort is temporary per current session.  If you like
results of one way you can later make a configuration change and have
it as your default.

I prefer the Ordered/Subj arrangement for listservs for continuity akin
to threaded discussions while preferring the Arrival sort order for
personal email.  My default is set for Ordered/Subj and I hit a comm
program macro to switch my Inbox (personal email) to Arrival order.

  The plus sign helps but is not totally sufficient.  In my office, we nearly 
alwasys include other people in mail, especially mail that talks about business and 
setting up meetings.  So it is rather rare for me to get any mail with a plus sign 
on it at all.  I still have the problem of not knowing if the mail is from a list or 
not.  Filtering will be the only hope, given the nature of lists.  I might very well 
have to change e-mail packages soon just to get filtering.

I suspect your "Cancel" problem is actually a problem with your terminal 
emulator and its setup rather than Pine itself.  For example, NCSA Telnet 
can be set up to handle ^C locally rather than transmit it to the host.

You can delete folders (and their contents if not empty!) from the Folder 
List screen (command "L" from the main menu, message index, etc).  Just 
highlight the folder you want to delete and give the "D" command.  You 
can also rename folders here.

Does anyone know why every 30 or 60 seconds the indicator that tells you 
how far you are in a message (73%, TOP, BOT, etc.) redraws itself?  This 
is in Pine 3.91.  Is it likely that the length of the message will change 
or that you will change positions in the message w/o pressing any keys?
Will this be eliminated or optional in future releases?

I posted about this several months ago, but I didn't know exactly what 
was redrawing itself.  People thought I was talking about the mail check 
cue or was crazy, but now through the benefits of a SLOW connection, I 
have figured out what it is.

Thank you for the file.  Your quick-start instructions took all of
three minutes to implement and then I began to read the full length
doc.  About 30 minutes into it I was curious so suspended reading and
did a quick check of mail.  Wonders, but there it was.  All mail ever
so neatly residing in respective file/folders I want incoming mail to
be filtered into (a few listservs are for business so I created a single
file/folder BIZ for those lists to collectively go into and makes for
much faster skimming in the morning when I haven't time to spare, then
separate files/folders for more casual listservs, each file/folder
named apropos the list.  Personal email, not desiring to filter it,
goes to the Inbox as before.)  Excellent.

I use NEWMAIL to notify me of newmail while online and modified its
command string to include my BIZ mail folder as well.  Works fine.

Quite a difference now, to load Pine and just see my personal email,
then go to respective folders to view listserv mail.

Again, thanks.

P.S.  What I don't understand is why it's taken so long to find this
very easy information.  I've asked everywhere and nobody has a straight
answer.  System Administrators, tech support, UNIX gurus, nada, when
'lo, I finally receive the info and in some 15 lines of explanation and
3 minutes later, it's installed and working fine.  I dunno.  Sometimes
I wonder about this "Information Highway."  Anyway, pardon my spleen, I
was just exhaling the pent up frustration I was experiencing now that
it's over.

What is the format (ie, syntax) for Distribution Lists?  Is a comma required

I have tried adding a large number of entries from a file directly into 
".addressbook".  When I went to "compose" in Pine so send a message to list,
a message appeared that I did not have commas (I had commas after each
entry).

Any advice would be most welcome.  Thanks

It's in emacs *and* pine. Here's how! (It's in the info tree...)

(1) Do "setenv EDITOR emacsclient" (or equivalent...)

(does not do the trick for pine but for other applications though..)

(2) Start emacs=20

(3) Within emacs (or from ~/.emacs) do M-x server-start.

(4) In pine (Setup - Config - Editor) set editor to emacs (or in ~/.pinerc)

When using it, remember to execute a M-x server-edit when you're through=20
editing. This makes emacs save, exit, and notify the client (i.e. pine)=20
that it's done.

That's it!

Has any work been done on the Elm FAQ to turn it into a nifty Web
document similar to the Filter and Signature ones?  I have tried
to contact the FAQ owner at strider.inet.it but this host seems
to be out of connection right now.  I notice that the FAQ hasn't
changed since December.

Subject: Printing in PC-Pine for Windows

When I print from PC-Pine for Windows, I get condensed print (132 columns, 
about 100 lines per page).  This is unacceptable and unreadable.

How do I change this to a more standard printout of 80 columns and 60 
lines per page?

I tried Setup|Printer from the Main Menu, but the program responds with 
nothing but a short pause.

I am running Windows for Workgroups 3.11 with an HP LaserJet IIIp, all 
properly configured.  I am using Pine 3.91, downloaded about 4 weeks ago.

Thank you in advance,

    Sorry that I don't have a specific answer for your problem.  So far I 
have not needed to take the time to discover tha exact internal format 
of the .addressbook file (Unix flavor).  One possiblity could be that 
Pine manages .addressbook entries with some non-displaying white space 
characters, most notably TAB.  (This may or may not be so.)  If you have 
access to an editor that can display a file or file lines in hexadecimal, 
that could show you whether you have some non-displaying characters 
separating the file fields.  (TAB has the ASCII value 9; sometimes it can 
be entered with a Ctrl-I, depending on the editor.)

I've been trying to compile Pine 3.91 under AIX 4.1.2 and it is
proving to be quite challenging (actually, trying to compile much of
anything under 4.1.2 is challenging).  Is there an official port to AIX
4.1.2 being done?  Should I just wait or attempt it myself?

I have written a little utility which depends on you having an IMAP2 
server on both systems to move the mail from one system to another.
Since PMDF is the only VMS package which comes with an IMAP server on the 
VMS side, this depends on you having PMDF on your VMS system. If you do 
have it and are willing to try it out, send me mail, and we'll arrange 
something.

I have managed to use 'formail' ( from the procmail package ) to 
do this, but I don't recall the details - mainly, because I did it
more than once with slightly different methods, with various levels
of success at different occasions, but all of them were quite some
time ago. 


I do recall that I had some trouble getting the date set correctly.
Some mailers ( I think pine was one ) are more strict than others
on the format of a "From " line and expected the date to be in the
proper format. Formail can generate a date if there is none in the
message, but since there was a "Date:" *VMS* header ( not in rfc822
format ), it just appended the improper date to the "From " line. 

I think I made two (or more) passes, temporarily renaming the "Date:"
header lines to "X-Date:", so that it would regenerate a "From " line
with the proper syntax, and then changing them back to "Date:" lines,
so that the mailers would display the proper date. ( I guess that
effectively made "arrival" date the same for all the messages, but the
send date was at least correct, if not correct rfc822 syntax. ) 

 On one of the attempts, I also recompiled formail with a different
message separator defined, but I don't recall if I needed this the
last time, but I don't recall what methods or switches I used to 
get it to separate the messages properly. If you try this, be sure
to get a count of the number of messages from VMS, and then check 
that you see the correct number from the unix mailer - if you don't,
then some messages may have gotten wrongly concatenated ( i.e. not
gotten properly separated! )

If I want to save to a folder selected bits from certain postings in a news 
group what's the best way to do it?  I could save to a plain file and  exit 
to edit (doesn't sound neat), or forward the message to myself and edit 
it before sending, but there ought to be a better way.  Unix isn't my strong 
suit BTW.
Thanks,

This is probably happening every time there is a check for new mail,
which by default is every 2.5 minutes.  I don't see how it could be
happening every 30 or 60 seconds, unless the default time has been
changed in your sources.  The reason it does this is because it's a lot
easier to just draw the percentage every time than it is to figure out
whether or not the percentage changed and/or the screen changed since the
last percentage was drawn.  It hasn't been fixed for next version so far.

There is a definition for SYSTEM_PINERC in the file
src/pine/osdep/os-xxx.h, where xxx is replaced by the three letters
appropriate for the port you're using.  You should just need to change
that.

It probably means that pine is trying to rename the temporary file it
built while rewriting the pinerc file and that temporary file is on a
different file system.  It's kind of hard to come up with reasons why
this might happen.  I you don't have write and execute access on your
home directory, I think that would cause it...

Yes.  Get support level supplement lng225b from sosco.sco.com; that
has a limited crypt library that will solve the problem.

I'm afraid I disagree with your attitude.  You seem to think everyone
should work the way you do and that anything else is, uhh, organized
procastination.  Bull.  Software ulitmately belongs to the user and
flexibility is paramount.  Now that I'm able to fully filter incoming
mail, I have already seen how much FASTER certain mail is tended to,
and how much EASIER it is to deal with it all.  You get 200 mails a
day?  I get that from but one listserv and within there is professional
needs to be dealt with.  Similarly, some mail can be filtered/forwarded
to staff for faster expediting.  Another thing I can now do is auto
filter/collate mail by days of week (and even times of day) to go
directly into daily reports folders that automatically become available
via Web page links per day of week.  No need for physically doing this
anymore, no depending on somebody always doing it even if they over
sleep or are sick or have an emergency to tend to, whatever.

So I respectfully disagree with you on this.  You tell me how I'm
supposed to "think of email", tell another they should read thousands
of mail in the same way you do, and so on.  I believe instead people
should work as THEY prefer and via their own zone.

Cordially, Bob

BTW, the filtering agent I'm using is FILTER and works just fine
through any of the mail programs since as you say it's not the mail
agent, but the filter agent; the mail agent then offers up the mail.
That's of course best since it allows us Pine users to use Pine, Elm
users to use Elm, Mail users to use Mail, and everybody's happy.

Hello pine experts,

  I have encountered a very strange problem with pine 3.91 under AIX 3.2.5 that
I wonder if anyone could shed some light on.  Heres the story.

  I've been using pine without any trouble on my RS/6000 for three months until
I had to reinstall AIX 3.2.5 from a new tape distribution.  Now when using pine
it hangs whenever I send mail.  I get the message Writing Fcc but pine just sits
without any response or activity.  Eventually I give up and kill my xterm 
window.  The same behavior occurs if I try to read the sent-mail file.  All 
other uses of pine are fine except for these two.  I can read all the mail I 
want but when I send one message, pine hangs.  The message does get sent by the 
way.  Any help will be greatly appreciated.

Regards
Todd Raeker

And why would you change email user agents?  Simply out of spite for
Pine not doing what you want?  And what mail user agent, pray tell,
will give you this filtering that you so desire?  I can't think of
one.

One last time, and listen VERY CAREFULLY: mail-filtering agents and
mail-user agents are TOTALLY SEPARATE.  Different animals, they aren't
used in the same way, don't get invoked the same way, and most
certainly do not do the jobs of the other.  You're not going to use
procmail anytime soon to read your mail (though I once had a wizardly
friend who set up procmail to find him on the campus network and pop
up a window every time a mail arrived).  And you won't, ever, filter
your mail when you're not logged in using Pine (unless the development
group has something up their sleeves they're not telling us
about... :)

People whining about their humongous amounts of mail...a few years
back when I posted a now-published essay, I got 2,000 individual
responses in the course of four days. I dealt with it, not by using a
filtering agent, but by staying up late and answering each and every
positive email, and throwing out all the negative. :)

And today I get an average of two hundred messages a day...I just have
everything land in one INBOX and I deal with it.  How? If I have time,
then I read everything.  Big deal, no fuss.  If I have less time, then
I move all my religious mailing-list mail (which is 60% of my email
these days...Unitarians are motormouths!) to another folder for later
reading, using the (;) Select command.  If I really don't have time,
then I just throw away all the list mail and I select mail that is To:
or Cc:'d explicitly to me to read immediately, and set aside the rest
for later.

I still have a few hundred messages always in my INBOX (if you're more
organized, there's no need to have more than a couple dozen, but, hey,
I'm a sysadmin), but my method at least means that all the mail at the
front of the INBOX is mostly mailing list or junk mail, while the mail
at the latest end is mostly directed to me.

When I've used filtering agents, it's been either to throw away mail I
absolutely, positively, never want to see again (like a chain-letter
that I kept getting again, and again, and again--I just auto-forwarded
it to the postmaster at the originating site) or when I've wanted
certain mail to change media--become a fax or a pager message.

I don't see where filtering agents give you any more time.  They just
give you organization, and automated procrastination. :)  And that's a
great boon for some, but for others it isn't really needed.

I am currently trying to setup my version of Unix Pine 3.89 so I cam use
it as a newsreader instead of tin. I have edited the appropriate section
in my .pinerc file to make it possible to read the said newsgroups but I
can't figure out a way of getting them to post. I notice the incoming
posts have a 'Newsgroups:' header. I do not have one of these. Do I need
one? If so how do I add one if it's possible. I would be most grateful for
help on this as it annoys me I have to run tin and pine at the moment.

    I am wondering if anyone else has encountered this problem.  I ran 
it by my service provider's help desk, and all I got was a "Dunno.  Never 
heard of it.  Send in a bug report."

    I use Pine 3.91 under Unix.  The problem has occurred _only_ with 
incoming USENET newsgroup postings, never with email.  Sometimes, 
seemingly at random, the entire message body is missing -- only the 
header appears.  It can be a bit annoying, particularly when the subject 
line leads me to think that I would be especially interested in the 
message.  Has anyone else run into this?

For the record, this is true.

There is a reason why it is this way.  We wanted to avoid the lossage with
message text lines that begin with the word "From"; specifically that a
">" character gets inserted in front of them.  But, we also had to avoid
the hokey "Content-Length:" header (it's a long story).

This was a requirement; our local users were getting pissed off at the
bogus ">"  characters in their messages.  [Of course, another alternative
is to use a format other than Unix mbox format...]

The solution we came up with is that our mail delivery tools do *not*
insert the ">" character in front of lines that begin with "From", unless
it is in a very precise format that is certain to be a message delimiter.
In turn, Pine does not consider a line that beings with "From" to be a
message delimiter unless it is in that precise format.

There are 20 variants of "From" header line that Pine recognizes.

Most mail delivery tools blindly insert the ">" in front of all message
lines that begins with "From", and most mail readers blindly declare any
line that begins with "From" to be the start of a message.

The problem comes in when a mail delivery tool uses some format of "From"
delimiter which is not one of the 20 that Pine knows about.  To date, all
of these episodes have been caused by site-local tools and not by any
known widely-distributed software.  But this can cause the situation of
"other tools work but Pine does not."

Partisans of the infamous "Content-Length:" mechanism may chime in and say
that they don't have this problem.  They're right; they have a completely
different set of problems that are potentially worse.  ;-)

ANYWAY...  For the most part, it works.  I'm fairly confident that the 20
supported variants cover what is actually out there.  I'm aware of a few
additional variants but as noted above they seem to be more due to local
mistakes.

Hi there!

I'm all new to Pine, but I have a question to which I have been unable to 
find any answer in the Pine documentation:

When posting to Usenet from Pine by NNTP to my ISP, Pine apparently does 
not enter an "Organization:" field in the header of the posting. My ISP 
detects this, and happily inserts that field himself - unfortunately, by 
adding his organization and not mine... :-(

Question: Can I make Pine insert that field, or shall I make a small 
patch of my own?

Hi folks. 
	Quick question.. I just want to know the precise format
to use in the .forward file for forwarding messages to another
location. I know it is simply one line, but like most things..
I forgot (duh!).
	I appreciate it someone could just respond either
here or through email with the appropriate line I need.

	Thanks..

In Setup/Config, make sure that enable-full-header command is
enabled.  Then when viewing mail, the H command will turn full
header display on.
 
I read that in the documentation, I'm sure you could too.  Does that
not produce the result that you want?

Open up Tin and look at the starting up lines. It should tell you what 
news server you are accessing. Then go into configuration and add value 
of what you found under nntp

I'm an ELM user in Sweden that has been suggested to use PINE
instead of ELM.

I got Pine 3.91 from an account in Norway, and tried to install
it on my Compaq Deskpro XL running SCO UNIX 3.2v4.2, but it
wouldn't build correctly (pico did, nothing else).

The problem is that the build script (using 'build sco') can't
find 'libcrypt.a', which I have been told is not allowed to be
exported from the U.S., hence not included in my version of SCO.

Does anyone out there know a way round this problem?

Is there a substitute for 'libcrypt.a', or perhaps another
version of Pine that doesn't require it?

I would be very happy if someone can help me out.

I do apologize if this is a FAQ.

Actually, that should be set the editor to "emacsclient", or use the

	I appologize if this question is covered in the Docs for pine,
but I am reading them currently and have a deadline to work for.

        I am trying to set up a basic configuration to pine for use by
some of the Facaulty, Staff, and Students of the University of Maryland.

        A problem We are having is that pine sometimes does not list who
a message is from in the index.  That is, it will say that it is
To:userx@machinename , but wont have the more common
From:usery@othermachine showing.

        Is there some compilation option, or configuration option which
will fix this, or is there some default that should be changed??

        Replies Are welcome by email, as I rarely find time to read
news.

	Note: presently we are not running imapd on the system.

There is such a message in this newsgroup right now, but the body *is* 
missing - I can't find it with TIN either!  Sometimes I have hit a wrong

Yep, I can't compile anything on my 4.1.2 box either...compile it on a 
3.2.5 box and move the binaries over.  Failing that, there are binaries 
for 3.2.5 on ftp.cac.washington.edu, you can use them just fine.

If they don't get gcc to work under 4.1.2 soon, I'm going to take a long 
vacation until it does... :)

I want to download a mailbox from a Unix site, then process my mail on my 
own computer using Pine (PC Pine) but apparently I can't just have it 
issue an exec() call to a mail processing program, it requires the PC 
have an SLIP connection or a network card.  Is there any way to do 
something like this, e.g. something like a UUCP service, but with less
overhead.  (Plus, UUCP isn't available on my site.)

While I haven't been able to find a PINE version for the MAC, I have been
able to find two other programs that handle IMAP fairly good:

1)MailDrop

http://ackmo.baylor.edu/files/Mail_Drop/info.html

Handles the mac interface really good, and handles MIME pretty consistently
but still can't handle remote mailboxes other than your INBOX (looks
like it is going to be added in the future.

2)Mailstrom

ftp://jhunix.hcf.jhu.edu/pub/apple-mac_software/Internet/EMail/Mailstrom/

Crappy interface and doesn't do MIME yet (I think version 2.0 will) but
handles remote mailboxes other than your INBOX fairly well.

All in all, I recommend MailDrop. Keep in mind that neither of these programs
handles usenet news. for that try NewsWatcher:

ftp://ftp.acns.nwu.edu/pub/newswatcher/

Good Luck!

In Pine 3.90, when I'm in my inbox, the current message is identified by an
arrow to the left of it.  In previous versions of Pine, the current message
was identified by a reverse video highlight bar that covers the entire
message.  It was much easier to spot which message was selected as current
in my opinion.  I have checked .pinerc and have not seen a way to select how
a current message is highlighted.  One choice in the features list mentioned
"showing selected in boldface" but this does not refer to highlighting the
current message.
I'd appreciate any help.  I'm wondering if this is a bug of a feature. 8-)

    I'm sure it's not a matter of being fumble-fingered at the keyboard. 
Once I posted a short message to a newsgroup.  When I went to view my own
message later, the body way missing.  However, not long after that,
another person replied to my post, quoting the entire message body, so I
know that it got through over the net to at least someone.  I do not say
that the problem is necessarily in Pine.  I was just wondering whether any
other Pine users had experienced a similar problem in order to be able to
start tracking down the source of the problem.

Can anyone suggest some explanations about why it takes Pine much longer
to close folders than to open them? The folders in question are say 1/2 MB
in length. Pine here runs on a fast server with less than 1.0 load at this
time. Version 3.91. Is it simply that the file is 1/2 MB in length?  That
doesn't make sense to me, because I just used emacs, as a test, to edit
the same folder. It took less than one second to load the file, and less
than one second to save it when I made a change to it. This happens with 
all folders, not just the one I tested (with an innocuous change).

Try creating a file ".rhosts" in your home directory containing:

xanadu.io.com

Assuming that xanadu.io.com is where you read your mail.  If it doesn't
work, then you'll need to get up with your system administrator and ask
that "host equivalence" be made between your login machine and the IMAP
server.  If your sysadmin refuses (there are valid reasons to refuse),
then you'll just have to get used to typing your password. 

Incidentally, IMHO host equivalence is actually a Good Thing if you are 
using protocols that send cleartext passwords over the network (which it 
sounds like you are doing).  It seems to me that allowing users 
unauthenticated access when they have presumably already been otherwise 
authenticated is better than sending passwords over the net every time 
you want to read mail!

Why?  If you don't like it, then don't have your system do that.  Do you 
refuse mail with a delivery notification (signature card) on it?

: You only have the right (perhaps) to know that the package was
: successfully delivered.

Why do you feel that someone may not do this?

: This demand, which is frequently made, is odious.

Please explain your reasoning.

Message-Id: <3or5js$1e6@interport.net>
Status: O
X-Status: 

I've looked through the comp.mail.pine archives and this seems to be a 
common, unsolved problem.  The cursor keys on our old Wyse 50s send out 
control key sequences that have other functions in Pine.

These terminals have no software commands that allow me to remap the 
cursor keys or to change emulation.  Although it's possible to use the vi 
cursor movement commands, I'd rather not have to force our users to do this.

Has anyone found a solution to this problem?  If there is a 
solution involving modified pine code, is this available anywhere?  Will 
this problem be addressed in any future version of pine?

Hi,

we have Pine 3.91 installed on our Linux server, it works very well. We 
have only one problem:

If pine is started via modem using BitComm Pine reports an unknown 
terminal type "DEC VT100" and cannot be started. 
At least our versions of BitCom don't allow to change the string "DEC 
VT100" to "VT100".

Do anyone have an idea how to convince Pine that "DEC VT100" is the same 
as "VT100"?

I get the impression from the online help that I can have more than one

these additional directory paths?

Also, while I'm here, what is the meaning of the Value settings I see
so frequently in the config file?  E.g., Personal Name,
Folder-Collections, etc., and the configuration line looks something
like:
          <No Value Set: using mail/[]>

What is meant by "Value"

Get the original post number (the "references") and be sure to have a
"Control:" header in the list of optional headers, or use the command
in pine to allow you to add it.

Use the following headers:

Control: cancel <D6J5Jz.72A@indirect.com> 
Subject: cmsg cancel <D6J5Jz.72A@indirect.com> 

And have a non-empty text; the signature should be sufficient

Most sites these days completely ignore the distribution header.
Thus, it is not surprising that pine(1) might strip it.

When you read the articels you are posting there, look at all the
headers -- there should be a way to do so; my NUA uses `t' to toggle
reduced vs. fukk headers -- and see if there is a blank distribution
headers, no distribution header, or or one specifying local.

Only in the latter case should the article be prevented from
propagating -- assuming a global newsgroup of course.

My mother is using a windows/winsock telnet session with Pine over SLIP,
when she replies to mail or composes a message, while there is postponed
mail, she loses the prompt messages. 

These are the prompts that ask if she wants to include the original
message, in the first case, and if she wants to continue the postponed
message, in the second. All that she sees is a YES and [NO] prompt, the
cursor is flashing at about column 60 on the message line which is the
same colour as the compose area.

Very confusing for someone just learning Pine.

I've tried setting Assume slow link (she's connecting with a 9600 baud 
modem) but this made no difference.

Any ideas?


Thanks for your help,
David.

David,
We've heard one report of this that was fixed by switching to a different
Windows telnet program, but I don't know the specific cause of the
problem.

    Don't bet the farm on my recollections, but I think some of the 
goodies for at least _posting_ to newsgroups came into Pine in version 
3.90 or 3.91.  V. 3.89 may not have had them.  In any case, when you try 
the Ctrl-R as was suggested, make sure the cursor is in the header area 
first.  (In 3.91, at least, Ctrl-R does different things in the header 
and the body.)

I think this is one of those cases where the inability to read intonation 
into USENET posts is causing flamage where none should exist.

I don't think that everyone should work the way I do.  Neither do I see no
need for filtering programs.  After all, I am writing one, and I wouldn't
do that if I thought they had no use (even though I won't likely use it
much myself).  I'm not a fan of offering things to my users that I don't
think will help them.

I'm simply saying that mail filtering is not a panacea to solve all 
problems, and that for some people, filtering isn't the best option.  I'm 
more fluid in my mailreading than the rigid rules that filtering 
provides; and if I find I'm not reading a list, week after week, and it's 
piling up, then I unsubscribe.

For some people, however, it increases organization drastically.  I 
recognize that, and because of that, I'm trying to get a filtering agent 
that will meet their needs.

Filter unfortunately suffers from some problems of its own, and even the 
filter developers suggest that serious mail-filter users should use 
procmail instead.  But if it does what you want, and you're not 
experiencing mail locking problems, then you should use it.

I should note here that I will soon be removing Elm, Mail, etc. from my
machines.  Not because I don't think they should use the other interfaces
(to the contrary, I have several news readers, web browsers, editors,
etc., even though that increases our work) but because Pine is the only
freely-distributable interface using IMAP, and we're going to remove local
filesystem access to mail very soon (we already have for all our Pine
users).  Is anyone working on backends to Elm, etc., that use IMAP like
Pine does?

Subject: PINE for Xenix?
Content-Length: 516
Status: O
X-Status: 

Has anyone ported Pine to SCO XENIX 386 (2.3.3)?  

Problem: We have no TCP/IP support.  SCO quoted $1,000 for adding it
and our e-mail system doesn't have that kind of budget.  (If it did,
we'd upgrade to full Unix anyway.)

I understand from the FAQ that Pine will not compile without TCP/IP
support.  Does that still apply even if we do not use IMAP?  Our link
to the outside world will be a UUCP link.  Only one local system is
involved.

Thanks for any advice!

I know that the chamber of commerce in powell-river is running pine under
SCO Xenix, I'm not sure what flavours though.

You might want to send mail to: al@caspian.coc.powell-river.bc.ca see what
they're doing.

Yes it is possible, but you will have to erase your .signature file, if 
you wish. You create as many different signatures as you want, and you 
have to read them in by pressing CTRL-R, and then specifying the 
filename. For example, s1, would be your first signature, and s2, would 
be your second signature.

1) Could you make ';'+'a'+'a'+'d'+'TAB' a single keystroke (catch up
and advance to next newsgroup)

2) Different sorting options for saving and viewing.

3) Is it possible to sort the news messages faster?

Rene.

I have the same question for Unix.  Your suggestion doesn't work for me

done with regular mail/mailx.  So can I use pine as a command line mailer?

There is such a message in this newsgroup right now, but the body *is* 
missing - I can't find it with TIN either!  Sometimes I have hit a wrong

I get the impression from the online help that I can have more than one
"folder-collections" and directory(s) for different kinds of
collections.  If so, where in the configuration file do I indicate
these additional directory paths?

Also, while I'm here, what is the meaning of the Value settings I see
so frequently in the config file?  E.g., Personal Name,
Folder-Collections, etc., and the configuration line looks something
like:
          <No Value Set: using mail/[]>

What is meant by "Value"

This is a known bug in Pine 3.89 on Linux.  If you upgrade to 3.91, I
think you'll find that the bug is gone.

If the ~/.newsrc file is on the same machine as the news spool, you can do
that now using IMAP.

More flexible capability is coming in IMAP4 support, but that will be in
a version of Pine after 3.92 (I am alpha-testing IMAP4 code now).

Briefly, the answer is "no".  Of course, you can modify the source code
(which we distribute) and build a private version.

The question is why do you want to do this?  20+ years of experience in
the Internet indicates that this is a terrible idea.  Historically, a
capability of omitting the local host name has caused more grief
(particularly in terms of mishandled email) than just about any other.

About 15 or so years ago, a widespread concensus was reached among email
developers that it should be extermined if at all possible, and that any
suppression of local host names should be strictly as a display feature.
Pine was developed about 10 years after this concensus.

Please reconsider.

When I try to post (via the compose command) to a newsgroup from Pine, the
program freezes and the only command the computer accepts is alt-x
(disconnect from the net).  I can reply to a newsgroup posting while in
Pine if I don't move the cursor into the header.  If I do, again, it
freezes. 

It would be a real convenience to be able to post from Pine.  (To post 
now, I exit Pine and enter Tin.)  Any suggestions?  I'm not a UNIX 
wizard, so I need easy instructions -- thanks!

Hi folks. 
	Quick question.. I just want to know the precise format
to use in the .forward file for forwarding messages to another
location. I know it is simply one line, but like most things..
I forgot (duh!).
	I appreciate it someone could just respond either
here or through email with the appropriate line I need.

	Thanks..

    If I may ask, how many more upgrades of Pine3.* are planned or
anticipated before moving along to IMAP4-Pine4.*?  After 3.92 (and any
bugfix/maintenance releases), will there be any more feature-laden
releases without IMAP4 support, comparable to the new features being
provided in 3.92?  Or doesn't anyone want to hazard a prediction about
this?

Thanks...

What is FILTER, on which systems does it run and where can it be obtained?

Can someone please help me?

I have just installed PINE 3.91 on my Compaq Deskpro XL running
SCO UNIX 3.2v4.2, and I have a problem.

When I compose a mail message, press '^X' to send it and verifies(sp?)
with 'Y', I get the message 'no valid author specification present',
and no mail is sent (it is posted to the 'post-sent' mailbox, though).

I recall someone posting something similar to the 'ELM' newsgroup, and
I think it has something to do with MMDF, and some setting that is needed
to make sure that the mailer properly inserts the (I think) 'from'-line.

As I can't mail at all at the moment, I would be very happy if someone
would take the time to help me out on this.

Either post the answer in this newsgroup, or e-mail me directly.

Thanks in advance

Hummm ... maybe it means you should use a comma to separate addresses.

Like if you want to send to frank@iud.com and to garry@sex.net and to 
mommy@america.off.line ... DON'T type

frank@iud.com (then hit your enter key)
garry@sex.net (then hit your enter key)
mommy@america.off.line 

instead type frank@iud.com,garry@sex.net,mommy@america.off.line

Like the message said, use a comma to separate addresses.  BYE, hope this

I built pine, pico, ipop2d, ipop3d and imapd at the same time.
I then added the appropriate lines to /etc/inet/inetd.conf.

("connection refused") although telnetting into port 110 is fine.

Any ideas as to what I might have done wrong?

I think this is one of those cases where the inability to read intonation 
into USENET posts is causing flamage where none should exist.

I don't think that everyone should work the way I do.  Neither do I see no
need for filtering programs.  After all, I am writing one, and I wouldn't
do that if I thought they had no use (even though I won't likely use it
much myself).  I'm not a fan of offering things to my users that I don't
think will help them.

I'm simply saying that mail filtering is not a panacea to solve all 
problems, and that for some people, filtering isn't the best option.  I'm 
more fluid in my mailreading than the rigid rules that filtering 
provides; and if I find I'm not reading a list, week after week, and it's 
piling up, then I unsubscribe.

For some people, however, it increases organization drastically.  I 
recognize that, and because of that, I'm trying to get a filtering agent 
that will meet their needs.

Filter unfortunately suffers from some problems of its own, and even the 
filter developers suggest that serious mail-filter users should use 
procmail instead.  But if it does what you want, and you're not 
experiencing mail locking problems, then you should use it.

I should note here that I will soon be removing Elm, Mail, etc. from my
machines.  Not because I don't think they should use the other interfaces
(to the contrary, I have several news readers, web browsers, editors,
etc., even though that increases our work) but because Pine is the only
freely-distributable interface using IMAP, and we're going to remove local
filesystem access to mail very soon (we already have for all our Pine
users).  Is anyone working on backends to Elm, etc., that use IMAP like
Pine does?

Hi there!

I'm all new to Pine, but I have a question to which I have been unable to 
find any answer in the Pine documentation:

When posting to Usenet from Pine by NNTP to my ISP, Pine apparently does 
not enter an "Organization:" field in the header of the posting. My ISP 
detects this, and happily inserts that field himself - unfortunately, by 
adding his organization and not mine... :-(

Question: Can I make Pine insert that field, or shall I make a small 
patch of my own?

This may be an absurd question but ...

Is there a version of Pine that I can run on a Mac ?? 

I've been watching for a FAQ, or other related posts & I'm guessing
that it's Pine for PC only ...

Any pointers appreciated.

    Possibly the simplest thing to do is to write whatever multiple 
signature files you want and store them under separate short names.  When 
you compose a message, just read in whichever one you want.  I am not 
aware of any method which will automatically tack on one or another sig 
file.  It would have to know somehow which one to tack on for which 
message based on some kind or other of criteria.

Is there an editor available that works similarly to Pine?  I have found 
it very easy to use and would like to use it instead of the other editors 
that are on my system.  VI is available but seems to be best suited for 
the programmers and often times I don't need all the overhead that is 
associated with using WordPerfect for Unix.

Can you help me or send me the email address of someone who can?

Thank you.

Pico, the Pine editor, is packaged with Pine.  It may be installed on 
your host already.  If not, you can get it in source or compiled from 
ftp.cac.washington.edu.

I'd like to know if it's possible to
start pine up in such a way that if
there's no email it will move me automatically
into reading newsgroups.
I tried:
pine -Iln
to get there and the l worked all right but
pine wouldn't take the n after
the l.
I'm wondering if something like this could be set
in the configuration file .pinerc.
btw, pine's interface to the configuration file
isn't speech friendly so I'll be using ex to get the fixes
done if this is where they're best put.
If I have email that's first priority but if not
I'd like to know if I can bypass the menu and
drop into my newsgroups list automatically.

Does pine 3.91 have a future delivery feature. In effect, can I create a

this planned for some future version of pine :^)

X-Status: 

One thing that's always bothered me is that the aggregate command 
(F)orward doesn't forward discrete messages, but concatenates them 
together into a single (occasionally huge) file and forwards that.  
It also seems to do this with print jobs, though I might be mistaken - 
terminal programs butcher printing so badly you can never tell.

The problem stems from a desire on the part of several of my users to 
forward their old mail to them in a huge batch.  I had hoped I could tag 
all of them and apply (B)ounce to them.  But that wasn't available, and 
when I applied (F)orward to them, it stuck them into what amounts to a 
digest file and wanted to forward that.  I wound up running a keyboard 
macro to bounce the messages individually to their new accounts.

I'd love for discrete forwarding of tagged messages to be an option in 
the next release, and I'd also be tickled if bounce became a command you 
can apply to a tagged set.  It seems that those are almost identical 
problems.

[Sorry if you've seen this before - I believe our news system was 
dropping outgoing articles in the bit bucket when I sent this before.]

Why not save the messages to a folder and send them the folder as an 
attachment.  They would merely have to Save the attachment to 
<folderdir>/<foldername> for the folder to end up in their mail directory.

(Having said that, I just postponed this message while, I tried it 
out and it worked fine.)

Incompatible mailbox types.  We're using MMDF here, and the target system 
is Berkeley/sendmail.  Most (but not all, of course) of the folders are 
definitely MMDF boxes, with the ^A^A^A^A at the top.  While I could go 
edit those for them and strip out the ^A's, it becomes a hassle.  And 
very few non-MMDF systems bother to compile in the MMDF support code in 
Pine/IMAP.

And the other thing is, suppose it were something like cc:Mail, where the 
folder format is not only totally incompatible, but propriatary and 
hidden.

We don't know yet.  If the IMAP4 c-client is useable by the time we get
Pine 3.92 finished and stable, we will probably make the switch then, but
there is always the possibility of external pressures or unforseen
problems...

Can anyone suggest some explanations about why it takes Pine much longer
to close folders than to open them? The folders in question are say 1/2 MB
in length. Pine here runs on a fast server with less than 1.0 load at this
time. Version 3.91. Is it simply that the file is 1/2 MB in length?  That
doesn't make sense to me, because I just used emacs, as a test, to edit
the same folder. It took less than one second to load the file, and less
than one second to save it when I made a change to it. This happens with 
all folders, not just the one I tested (with an innocuous change).

    Pine's composer has been "split out" as a separate editor called Pico 
(PIne COmposer).  If you are using Unix Pine, I would suppose that Pico 
is also lurking around somewhere from the installation of Pine.  Just try 
entering "pico" or "pico <somefile>" (no quotes).  If that doesn't work, 
try looking in the libraries /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin.  Failing that, 
ask your system administrator.

Hello, I am a college student at the University of San Diego, in 
California. I am currently in the process of doing a survey on college 
students' usage of e-mail.  

I am interested in any advice you have about e-mail and how it has 
affected you. 
Hopefully you are a college student and a user of the system.  I would 
like to know how you feel about it.  What are the greatest benefits it 
brings you? And the negative aspects?

E-mail can be a powerful thing.  Do you think it will change in the 
future? Do you think it should?  

If you have ever heard of it short-circuting or if this has happened to 
you let me know about it!
I am very interested in getting "lively" advice from anyone (preferable 
college students) who use e-mail, and how it has effected you.  
Tell me how many hours a week you spend on it etc etc.

This is not a research project, it is for a journalism story, so I need 
interesting facts and opinions!!
I do not know too much about e-mail, so anything will be greatly appreciated!

Please respond quickly, seeing as our College finals are just around the 
corner!!

Pine uses "<ESC>[5i" and "<ESC>[6i" to print on a desktop printer 
connected to the ANSI terminal or the terminal emulator. This works fine.
I like this feature. So I tried to emulate the Pine print command by 
writing a script file called dprint (Unix):
   # dprint file-name
   echo "\033[5i"
   cat $1
   echo "\033[6i" 

This could re-direct printing to my desktop printer. My
terminal emulator *hangs* (actually everything is redirected to the
printer, so I can't see) when I execute the script. When I close my
emulator (Windows based), I get a print-out. I never got the Unix prompt
back. 

What am I doing wrong ? I even tried sending a ^D after the cat.

Though this is not a Pine question, I am sure somebody out here knows the 
answer.

Thanks in advance.

X-Status: 

  I'm experiencing some trouble *reading* MIME articles in Pine 3.91
  that were sent to me from non-Pine MIME-compliant mailers.

  For example, when a colleague sends me a MIME note from Pegasus Mail for
  Windows (Version 20 Wide Beta) and attaches a GIF image file, Pine
  doesn't show the extra attachment, although the MIME headers look
  correct to me.  Instead the BASE64 version of the GIF file is seen
  in the standard text portion of the note.

  On the other hand, when I send him an attachment, he *does* see it,
  although his external GIF viewer does not start automatically, as
  it normally does.  Instead, he has to select to save the file and
  then manually view it.

  Is there a known bug in Pine regarding this type of behavior?  Any
  help would be appreciated.

Subject: Help: pine vs. zmlite - which requires more system maintenance?
Date: 17 May 1995 16:23:48 GMT
Message-Id: <3pd7uk$38@sunburst.ccs.yorku.ca>
Status: O
X-Status: 

UNIX gurus and and systems administrators might be able to answer my 
questions about the sort of maintenance required to keep pine running on 
a mail system.

I have student mail account on an RS/6000 server running AIX v.3.  The
only mail reader provided that more sophisticated than Unix "mail" is
zmail.  Because I have a low-speed modem connection and can only use a
text-based mail reader, I have to use zmlite, zmail's text-oriented
reflex.  Zmlite is, to say the least, rebarbative: it is slow, gobbles up
precious bandwidth with endless dialog boxes, and is difficult to
customize. 

I would prefer to use a mail reader like pine, but the local system
administrator nixed the idea, saying that he didn't have the human
resources necessary to maintain more than one mail program (i.e.  zmlite)
on his servers in the event of changes to system configurations.  He felt
that the computer systems help staff would also be overloaded if they had
to support user inquiries about pine in addition to inquiries about
zmail/zmlite.  He also said that because zmail/zmlite was a commercial
program, he could rely on ready support. 

Questions:

1) Is this true or is it a crock?  Does a system administrator 
(particularly one running it on AIX) have to perform significant 
housekeeping on pine?

2) How does system maintenance of pine compare to that of other mail 
readers, particularly elm and zmail/zmlite?  Is commercial user support a 
substantial bonus?  

Private responses are preferred, but please post to the group if your 
response is of general interest.

The mailer of our Internet gateway is configured so that incoming mail must
be sent to user account on the gateway machine (say A). I am running pine on
another machine (say B). The account name on A and B are different. When
sending mail, the From line is automatically changed to

account-B@machine-A

When people type r to reply, the reply mail is always bounced because there
is no account-B on the gateway machine. Is there a way to get around this 
problem?

Please reply by e-mail. Thanks a lot!

I use pine to read/reply news and it works fine until just then I

In the pine help, there is mention that pine will use the arrow instead 
of highlighting when it is "...used over a low speed dialup line...".
Where you using it over a modem in one instance and over a direct
connection in another?

Use B(ounce) command (you may need to enable it in S(etup) C(onfig) menu).
This should do the work (althoug you cannot change the To: field, you can=
=20
add a new Resent-To: field).

Happy pining! (I hope this word doesn't mean anything bad)

I highly recommend joe2.8.  It's no harder to use than pico, but it's much
more powerful.

I have been having problems using pine to retrieve mail from my

pine aborts with "Pine Bug received abort signal". I thought it
was a problem with the POP interface but now I am wondering.

The same problem happens when I try to open a local MH style inbox.
I noticed that the MH format is different from standard UNIX mail
in that the first line  "FROM Somesystem Date" (not FROM: whoever)  
is not part of the header.  If I add this line, then pine can read the
message normally. What does this all mean?  Is the bug elsewhere?

Does someone out there have the answer? Please help!

John, After reading your suggestions again about separating addresses with
commas I realized that what I was doing wrong was not hitting the enter
key after each field advancement.  This is where I was getting the error

online can be subscribed to from the news and conferance section of my
"Tass newsreader"that I use with Pine .   Please e-mail me with any
suggestions. Thanks

This is not an answer, only a pointer. 1) There was a patch for pine sent=

to this mailing-list which solved some bugs in pine POP code a mont or=20
two (or three) ago. Maybe you need it (I hope pine development team will=20
put into versiom 3.92 although they probably do not continue in=20
development of this part). 2) Also a short time ago there was a noto sent=

here you have to say something like #MHINBOX instead of INBOX if you use=20
inbox in MH format. Please try to get more sure pieces of information=20
before doing this. This text relies on my memory only!

This is nothing to do with Pine, but with your news server.

It is possible for the systems administrator to configure the news server 
to reject articles -- doesn't matter if they come from Pine, Tie, 
whatever -- if there is more "included" text than original material 
contributed to the article by yourself.

Private mail should have a + on the left side of the screen, so you can 
readily distinguish it from list stuff.

: Also might it be possible to group all mail from one mailing list together?

Not automatically, if that's what you mean, but make a folder for each 
list and (s)ave them to the applicable folder, then read them when you 
get a chance.

: I'm writing a _very_ _simple_ program to send mail using an ANSI (not

: poking keystrokes into PINE.

Create an RFC 821 (SMTP) envelope, prefix your messages with RFC 841
headers, add a CR LF . CR LF between messages, and then you can use
/usr/lib/sendmail -bb in front of the file, and just send out the message
as an ascii packet into sendmail.

I'll write you privately, as this is something I'm working on.  Maybe we 
can work together on this.

Pine lists the 3 default folders (inbox, sent-mail, saved-messages) 
first, then all others that you create are alphabetized automatically, 
not sure you can change that easily.

What I'd like to see is a version of the UNIX release ported down to the 
PC so that those who just simply want to use Pine the same way as a Unix 
system does (it reads a mailbox, it writes to a file and then runs a 
program to deliver that file to the mail system), that would be much more 
useful than any of the current PC releases that mandate use of a network 
card and cannot be used otherwise.

I missed the original question, but I don't think this answer is the one 
you want...

"C" *always* starts composing a brand new message.  What your cursor is 
positioned over is irrelevant.

"R" (reply) starts a reply to the person who sent you the current 
message.  Their e-mail address is filled in automatically from the 
message you currently have selected, and you are given the chance to 
include the text of the original message to provide context.

"F" (forward) forwards the message on to a third party.  Thus if user A
send user B a message, and B then forwards it to C, C received the message
marked as being from B.  If C selects "reply" the reply will be sent to B. 
Whilst forwarding B is given the chance to add text to the message they
are forwarding. 

"B" (bounce) *resends* the current message.  This is extremely useful 
when a you have received a message that someone else should deal with 
(eg, perhaps you are manning a Help Desk).  In the above example, if user 
B *bounces* the message to user C, user C receives it marked "from" user 
A.  This means they can just hit "R" to reply straight to the original 
author (user A).  Bouncing a message simply passes the message on; you 
don't get a chance to add to the message.  User C is told that it came 
via B by "Resent-from:" header lines.

The Bounce command is not available by default (to keep Pine's basic 
command set simple for new users).  You must go into the Setup 
Configuration screen (S then C from the Main Menu) and select the 
"enable-bounce-command" feature.

Hope this helps!

Yep, I can't compile anything on my 4.1.2 box either...compile it on a 
3.2.5 box and move the binaries over.  Failing that, there are binaries 
for 3.2.5 on ftp.cac.washington.edu, you can use them just fine.

If they don't get gcc to work under 4.1.2 soon, I'm going to take a long 
vacation until it does... :)

Hi all,

Does anybody know how to set an SMTP server in UNIX, so PC-PINE is able 
to use it and sends and receives E-mail ?


P.s.  I looked through the FAQ for pine, but I still have some hard time 
      doing it.


		Any help will be appreciated


						Thanks

Is there a makefile to allow me to compile the Unix-based source for Pine
so I can run it as a standalone file-processing (mailbox access) mailer on
my IBM-PC rather than a networked one?  I'd probably have to edit the
source files to change the include file names. 

The version of Turbo C++ I have is Turbo C++ version 3.0 which includes 
Turbo C.  Is there anything special I need to be aware of?

In Pine 3.90, when I'm in my inbox, the current message is identified by an
arrow to the left of it.  In previous versions of Pine, the current message
was identified by a reverse video highlight bar that covers the entire
message.  It was much easier to spot which message was selected as current
in my opinion.  I have checked .pinerc and have not seen a way to select how
a current message is highlighted.  One choice in the features list mentioned
"showing selected in boldface" but this does not refer to highlighting the
current message.
I'd appreciate any help.  I'm wondering if this is a bug of a feature. 8-)

    I'm sure it's not a matter of being fumble-fingered at the keyboard. 
Once I posted a short message to a newsgroup.  When I went to view my own
message later, the body way missing.  However, not long after that,
another person replied to my post, quoting the entire message body, so I
know that it got through over the net to at least someone.  I do not say
that the problem is necessarily in Pine.  I was just wondering whether any
other Pine users had experienced a similar problem in order to be able to
start tracking down the source of the problem.

Why?  If you don't like it, then don't have your system do that.  Do you

Why do you feel that someone may not do this?

Please explain your reasoning.

While I haven't been able to find a PINE version for the MAC, I have been
able to find two other programs that handle IMAP fairly good:

1)MailDrop

http://ackmo.baylor.edu/files/Mail_Drop/info.html

Handles the mac interface really good, and handles MIME pretty consistently
but still can't handle remote mailboxes other than your INBOX (looks
like it is going to be added in the future.

2)Mailstrom

ftp://jhunix.hcf.jhu.edu/pub/apple-mac_software/Internet/EMail/Mailstrom/

Crappy interface and doesn't do MIME yet (I think version 2.0 will) but
handles remote mailboxes other than your INBOX fairly well.

All in all, I recommend MailDrop. Keep in mind that neither of these programs
handles usenet news. for that try NewsWatcher:

ftp://ftp.acns.nwu.edu/pub/newswatcher/

Good Luck!

I have been using a Netware mounted volume for some time to hold the Pine
software.  This has allowed me to run Pine from anywhere on the net.  Recently I 
switched to NT and have discovered that I can't update my address book anymore.
  When working with other software that read's and writes the Netware volume I have 
no problems, just with Pine.  I moved the stuff locally so that I could update my
address books and that works, of course.

  On another topic, I have noticed that PC-Pine for Windows fails a little more
frequently under NT than WIN3.1.  The error message I get is always something about
magic failing!  I always knew my magic was weak.

Hmmm...I don't think that MFAs are a third prong, because unlike MTAs and 
MUAs, MFAs are optional.

Whether MFAs reside on the server depends on whether you want the 
filtering to happen immediately upon receipt of mail, or at any time up 
to the point when you start your MUA.  If immediate filtering is a 
requirement, then yes, the functions must reside on the server.  On the 
other hand, if you could live with doing the filtering when you log in, 
then you could use procmail (if you have /usr/spool/mail access) or the 
program that I'm writing to filter your mail at that time.  Then it 
wouldn't matter whether it lived on the server side or the client side.

Then you'll have to get your service provider to establish some route for
you to use MFAs.  This thread is reminiscent of how people a few years ago
who used ftp-mail gateways, usenet-mail gateways, web-mail gateways, etc.,
wanted to know why a X-mail gateway didn't exist, where X could be telnet,
MUD, IRC, or some other interactive service.  If you don't like the amount
of access your service provider gives you, then you should agitate for
more access, or find another service provider.  These days, Unix shell
accounts are so cheap that if you want it, you can probably get it. 

>  You must live in an environment where you have control of the server side?

No.  You just need to be in an environment where your provider has 
yielded you enough control of your mail (via .forward files and MFAs) 
where you can do it yourself.  If they haven't, then you can switch to 
any mail user agent, but your level of access won't get any better.

See if you can add 'From: ecramer@luna.nl' as one of the headers, in either
of the parameters of default-composer-hdrs or  customized-hdrs

If you can't, then you have to recompile the source to Pine:

1. add the following

   #define ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM

   in file ./pine/osdep/os-xxx.h

   where xxx is the 3-letter code for your machine

2. make pine

3. bring it up, and add the 'From: ecramer@luna.nl' field to the 
   two items

If you can either create a header the X.400 gateway will take, or specify 
the address, e.g.

"S=dorrington/O=ABC_CO@ADMD-GATEWAY.COM"

Where "ADMD-GATEWAY" is the name of the X.400 service that takes the

Are you losing mail consistently, or sporadically?  If consistently, then 
yes, you're probably not using the program quite right; is there 
something specific that 'man procmail' isn't giving you that you need?

If you're losing mail sporadically, then you may have a file locking 
problem, a network problem, or something else.

The Unix version wasn't ported to DOS the same way, so it won't work

Change the configuration setup for Pine with the S C commands.

Go to the line that reads
user-domain            = 

Issue the C command to change it, and change it to

host.edu

Press return, go to the line that reads

use-only-domain-name       =

And set this to Yes.

You can, you just have to recompile the source to allow the From: and 
Sender: headers to change.    Default is to not allow those to be changed.

Then you have to add them to the set of optional headers.

    On the whole I am satisfied with Pine (Unix, 3.91).  However, I wish 
I could customize it in one more way.  (I cannot just take the source 
code and tear it apart and put it back together any old way.)  Maybe I am 
overlooking something in the documentation, but in case I'm not, I will 
be grateful if anyone has an answer for this.

    So far as I know, Pine was written generally with the unsophisticated 
or "naive" computer user in mind, which is fine, especially since Pine 
allows the more experienced user to enable additional features.  In 
general, I would call myself a more experienced user (of computers in 
general).  Pine usually prompts me whenever I am about to take some sort 
of "action," such as sending mail, posting to a newsgroup, and so on.  I 
would like to be able to turn these prompts off, if possible.  I 
(usually) know what I'm doing, and if I fummble finger it, then that's my 
fault, not Pine's.  My personal preference is to run without so much hand 
holding.  Does anyone know of a way to turn some of these prompts off?  
Thanks.

Paul

Servers?  Do you want an IMAPD daemon?  Or do you really want PINE?
 
Either way, you could start at
 
http://d1.ph.gla.ac.uk/%7Eflavell/vms-pine.html
 
for pointers (n.b this is just a pointer to the real packages, I
didn't do much more than just install the stuff.  And as for the
IMAPD, I did not install that, I only pointed to the info about it).

 I did it the following way and it's working for me but I m using vi though.
 Following is the way I did it.
1) In set up of configuration there is a feature list. I set the  
   enable-alternate-editor-implicitly option on.
2) There is an option to set the name of editor. It is at third position
   from very bottom of configuration set up. I just typed vi over there.

   Let's hope it will work fo r U too. Have fun in using your favourite
   word processor as I m having fun using vi with pine.

Questions about the "pico" editor can and probably _should_ be addressed to
the "comp.mail.pine" newsgroup.  PICO was developed to work within the pine
mailer.

    Don't bet the farm on my recollections, but I think some of the 
goodies for at least _posting_ to newsgroups came into Pine in version 
3.90 or 3.91.  V. 3.89 may not have had them.  In any case, when you try 
the Ctrl-R as was suggested, make sure the cursor is in the header area 
first.  (In 3.91, at least, Ctrl-R does different things in the header 
and the body.)

I think they did change the frequency of checking mail from every 2.5 
minutes to every 1 minute on my system.

Could you explain to me how the percentage can change when you get new 
mail?  If I'm reading a message, and I'm 73% through it, and then new 
mail comes in, I'm still 73% through the message as long as I haven't 
pressed any keys.

X-Status: 

I'm using pine 3.91 (actually both PC-Pine and BSD unix Pine 3.91)

I have set up a customized 'Reply-To:' header in the setup/config and
when i try to do a news posting (and do Ctrl-R to show expanded headers)
I can see the proper 'Reply-to' in the header.  However, the 'Reply-To'
field never makes it to the actual posting!  Is their another item in
Config I need to set or is this a 'bug' or 'feature'.  When I post via
the same NNTP server using any windows news reader ot Netscape I always
get the reply-to header correct, so I don't think it's an nntp problem
but... 

I rely on this especially when I post the same msg both as mail and news
at one time.  Usually I prefer to use a newsreader program for news work,
but sometimes Pine is more useful/powerful. However, I need it to work
right.

Thanks for any help.

Our pine Setup-Config menu lacks the Options option.  Can I download
Options from somewhere?  And once I have, how do I install it? TIA.

P.S. Thanks to all who responded so promptly to my previous inquiry about 
the Bounce command.

Does someone else have similiar problems with Bouncing?

I tested the "Bounce" option, by "bouncing" a mail message which I got - 
to myself. The original "To:" field (in the original message) was a general 
address, which includes the e-mail addresses of all of the Music Faculty 
in Edinburgh University.

So, I used "Bounce" and entered my address as the "to:" parameter. I 
mailed it and... nothing happened. Nada. Nichts. Got no new mail.

On the other hand, in the next two days (so far... :-) I have people from 
the Music Faculty telling me that they got my message - but why did I 
send it again? After all, it was a general message from the library - why 
should -
	1) it be send again?
	2) from my account?
(both questions are pretty logical, I must admit.)

Anyway, I asked someone to forward me a copy, with full headers. 
Apparently, it DOES have the "Resent-To" field with my address - but 
still, it went to the ORIGINAL (general) address...

Does someone know -
	1) Why's that?
	2) Why didn't it appeared as if it was from the original poster 
	   (as I understood, the "bounce" command should do just that)?
	3) Why, if it WAS posted to the general address, didn't *I* get a 
	   copy of it - as I usually do, if I'm sending mail to a 
	   general-address which I'm included in?

Thanks,

the blank lines in the header will fix the problem. 

Does anyone know a fix for this?  A script file to remove blank lines in

Just getting new mail won't cause it to change, but there are lots of
commands you could have done that would.  The point is that it is easier
to just draw the percentage every time through the command loop than it
is to try to figure out whether or not you might have done something that
might have changed it.  The new mail check is just something that
potentially happens when you go through the command loop.  Any other
command may have also happened.

My appologies, this is probably more Trumpet related than Pine:

Has anyone experienced working in Pine over a Trumpet winsock SLIP 
connection for about 15 to 20 minutes and then having the session stop 
responding?

Appreciate any help, or if you can recommend the trumpet mailing list 
address I can take this thread there...


Thanks,
David.

To uuencode/uudecode a binary file you must provide two parameters:
1) the input file and 2) a file tag; this is used by uudecode to name
the output file. Output is normal sent to stdout so you can redirect
it to an output file. The examples below use dmh as the output file.

An example of uuencode and uudecode follows:
uuencode:
    uuencode coyote.doc coyote.xxx > dmh

uudecode:
    uudecode dmh

To confirm the file was successfully decoded, perform a diff:
    diff coyote.xxx coyote.doc



Hope this helps,
David.

If you are using an older version of pine (e.g., 3.89), there is no Options
option.  However, most of the configurable items that you can do from the
Options option in, say, version 3.91, you can do by manually editing the
.pinerc file if I'm not mistaken.

If the only problem with procomm and pine is that you can't read the 
high-lighted text, you should have fixed it when you changed either the 
background or foreground colors for highlighted text.

I've received some messages in my Pine account that incorporate

using vi I see what looks like ANSI escape codes surrounding
the altered text, but I've been unable to duplicate it.

Can anyone clue me in?  Do I need any special entries in my
.pinerc file?

Thanks a lot,

Hi , 
   I have an "impad" daemon for  my Unixware 2.0 machine
which I downloaded from Novell's ftp site. Unfortunately, 
I could not find any instructions to set it up. Could anyone
send me the /etc/services and any other files which 
have to be made to run this daemon? Do I need to make any
changes to inetd.conf? 

      I also would liketo know if I can have both a POP daemon 
and an IMAP daemon running on the same machine concurrently. 

Please reply by email to prasad_bhyrava.amadeus@aac.com

    Thanks and bye

    Go to the Main Menu by typing "M", choose Setup by typing "S" choose

    and type "X" an X will appear in between the "[]" so it'll look like

Subject: order of fields in header list
Message-Id: <D8tJrs.BC@news.cern.ch>

Status: O
X-Status: 



I am using Pine Version 3.90 on an Ultrix 4.3.0 workstation. When 
composing a message, I would like to include a Reply-To field by default, 
which I know how to do. However, I would prefer that the Reply-To field
is not the first, i.e. top header in the header list but that the To: 
field were instead. This is to stop myself putting the target email 
address in the Reply-To field since I am used to typing the address 
without having to go down a field first. i.e. Is there a way to change
the default order of the fields in the header list when composing a message?
 
Thanks

Does anyone know a way to disable MIME encoding in Pine?   I'm getting 
lots of problems e-mailing to Russia because they haven't adopted it yet, 
and I can't really ask everyone I send mail to there to go and get a MIME 
decoder, because they are business associates and that would be stupid.

Any help would be appreciated.

Your problem is probably that Pine MIME encodes _attachments_, if I 
understand correctly.  See possible replies to my post about that a 
little further down, as I am having the same trouble sending Russian 
e-mail, as the Russian Koi-8 character set uses 8th bit ASCII, and I am 
willing to put good money on Chinese being the same way.

As you Read The Fine Manual, you'll see that Pine requires an IMAP mail server
running on your host.  Pine does not support the less-capable POP protocol.

    Getting acknowledgement of receipt of mail from a remote system, 
sometimes called a delivery receipt, is a dicey proposition.  (There 
could be two forms: acknowledgement by the remote system that the mail 
arrived at that host at all, or an acknowledgement sent when the 
recipient actually looks at the mail.)

    To the best of my knowledge, there is no requirement in the Internet 
community whatever that delivery receipts be provided, and there are no 
standards for it.  When it is done at all, different host systems do it 
in different ways, and many do not do it at all.  Therefore, even if 
Pine made some sort of provision for automatic acknowledgement of receipt, 
there is no guarantee whatever that a remote receiving system would even 
respect it.  So far as I know, Pine does not even make provision for it.  
Sorry.

Hello,
I often tend to use the same key patterns very often.
Since i have many incoming folders (procmail sorts it, pine reads it) in some
of my folders (mailing lists) I want to delete all the messages right after
I browse/read through them.  In some i want to mark them all read.  To do this
i ussally do command sequences like ;aad or ;aa*!n etc.  If there was a way
like in vi (:map) to do this it would be wonderful!  No more pains to do 
simple things!

Thank you for a *great* mail program!

Currently there are no mail readers available on one of my accounts
and I would like to have access to PINE to read mail.  Do I just
download the binaries and install it in my shell acount or do I need
root access to be able to install/use PINE.  Also, related to that
question, how do I find out what kind of system I am on?  Finger tells
me what shell I'm using, but not the operating system.  Basically I
need a FAQ on installing pine.  Thanks in advance.

Yes you can. Use the Custom Headers. I posted this question about how to
get a receipt, before, and nobody answered, but I hacked around with it
and got it to work. I'm not in Pine right now, so I can't tell you exactly
what I did. But I'll post it if anyone is interested when I check what I
did ...

Works for most systems, although it didn't work when trying to post a
newsgroup message in Pine. Maybe it was just that particular newsgroup,
though.

    Please do post this information, especially as I was the one who 
replied that it couldn't be done by Pine.  I am aware that it can be done 
to some extent by mail-processing front ends such as procmail on Unix.  I 
still don't see how it could be done for newsgroup postings (or why one 
would even want to, most of the time).  I would be interested in knowing 
of your solution.

Put this script in a file named customquotes:

#! /bin/csh -f
set MYCHARS = ":_ "
sed s/"^> "/"$MYCHARS"/g < $1 > ~/pico.$$
cat ~/pico.$$ > $1
rm ~/pico.$$
- -------- CUT HERE ---------

Make it executable (chmod 700 customquotes), and point Pine's alternate 
editor at it.

Reply to a message. Hit ^_  ( <control> _ ) to change the leading "> " to 
the value of MYCHARS.

tried moving the file to the "mail directory.  It did register as one of 
my folders, but when I accessed it with Pine, it told me it was only one 
read-only message.  I copied a folder into my home directory and examined 
it, but did not find anything different about it.  There were several 
blank lines between the end of one message and the beginning of the 
next.  Is there a way to edit a file so that Pine will see it as a series 
of messages?  Thank you for your answer.

Hi,
I was wondering if any of you might have had experience with my problem. I am
trying telnet to an account that I have at Duke University from UCONN. The

able to telnet (and ANET) to my computer O.K. I cannot, however, use Pine. The
message I receive is that the Duke system does not recognize the terminal
emulation IBM-3278-2. Does anyone know a way to emulate something that the Duke
computer, a SUN station, will recognize? Any Ideas would be greatly appreciated
.Please mail me at MLR94001@UCONNVM.UCONN.EDU. Thanks again.

Ok, I checked and this is what I added to the Setup/Configuration: 

customized-hdrs        = Return-Receipt-To: maryb@eskimo.com

That's it. It won't show up in your outgoing message unless you select

  I am having difficulties in attaching a Word file to e-mail as follows: 
1) The document is saved in 'word' format, supposedly interchangeable 
between Mac and PC platforms.  Note: the doc has also been saved in 
various windows formats. 2) Document is sent "sz" from my Mac w/ Z-term 
to my Unix account. 3) File is attached to mail using control key in 
Pine. 4) Receiver is unable to translate file; i.e. the file will not 
open in Word.  

 I have not had this problem with files saved in text-only format, but I 
need to retain the formatting of the document including special 
characters.  Can anyone help with this?

    Thanks for replying.  I was aware of these points (especially how to 
configure Pine).  Somehow I had the idea (perhaps mistakenly on my part) 
that someone was claiming to have coerced a delivery reciept from a 
receiving end by doing something on a sending end.  As you point out, 
not all systems even respond to the Return-Receipt-To: field if it is 
present.

    I certainly do not have any kind of figures, but I speculate that
a significant portion of non-Unix systems (e.g., IBM VM/PROFS) do not
recognize this field.  In such a case, there is nothing the person using
Pine to *send* mail can do, short of getting a new Internet standard
through and waiting for it to be universally implemented.

    This evening I discovered a gotcha with my communications software 
and Pine on a dialup Unix.  I'll describe it, and anybody interested may 
email me for the fix, as it will apply only to a minority of readers.

    When composing/replying/forwarding in Pine, one may invoke an 
alternate editor (Alt Edit) with the keystroke ^_ (control-underscore).  
J. Kelly Cunningham's useful (thank you) tip of earlier today to replace 
the message-quoting characters makes use of this.

    I simply had had no reason to use this function before, so when I 
tried it, blooey!  Fortunately, the fix is simple.  I am using PROCOMM 
Plus Version 2 on an MS-DOS PC, Version 5.  PROCOMM Plus dials me into my 
Internet service provider, a BSD Unix system which has Pine 3.91 
installed.  When I press the ^_ key combination, I do not get whatever I 
specified for an alternate editor for Pine.  Instead, the screen flashes 
clear and shifts into 43-line mode!!!  It takes a bit of coaxing and 
coercing on the keyboard to get my Unix-and-Pine session back.

    Obviously, what you see ain't what you get.  Although I have not 
found it yet in the PROCOMM documentation, ^_ obviously does not send the 
desired value (hex 1F, I think) back to the host.  Instead, PROCOMM Plus 
intercepts it and does weird things.  Fortunately there is a simple 
solution involving PROCOMM Plus's keyboard remapping program.  If my 
scenario fits your situation, email me and I'll send instructions on how 
to do it, rather than take up space here for those not affectd.

Have any BitCom users experienced the "Expected Variable or Constant"

Any ideas on how to fix this?

Unfortunately, Pine 3.91 has a bug in the Export command such that the
message separator is missing a space (before the date, I think) so that
Pine does not recognize it as a valid message separator.

Sorry... but if you're handy with Unix tools you should be able to fix
the file.

Mary,
The header is sent even if you don't happen to look at it via ^R.

If you want to choose on a case-by-case basis, then just put the header
name in the custom headers, then add your own address (which you may want
to have in your addressbook as a single character nickname) whenever you
need this facility.  If you don't also have that header in the default
composer header list, you'll need to use ^R to reveal it.

  Put something like the following line to your /etc/services file:
imap         143/tcp                 # IMAP Remote Mail Access Protocol

and something like the following line to your inetd.conf file:
imap         stream tcp nowait /usr/local/etc/imapd imapd

then it should work (of course replace the path and file name by your=20
system path to the imapd file).

  Yes, it is possible, we run both servers at our Unix host.

This is actually something I would definitiely like to see disabled 
(possibly under the control of an option in the configuration screen).

It is not unknown for people to receive such messages with (possibly 
accidentally included, courtesy of other operating systems) funny control 
sequences that mess up their terminal when reading messages.

In fact with certain types of terminal/terminal emulator the possibility 
of including such control characters for "display" by Pine can cause more 
serious problems (eg, locking up of terminals) and even security problems.

I would *really* like to see control characters (including Escape) 
filtered out/displayed as "real" text when a message is displayed within 
Pine.

Yes.  Don't 'attach' it.  Instead, read in the ASCII file using the 
ctrl-R command while in the composer (the message text portion).

We've seen the problem here.  It was caused here by incompatible versions of 
Word.  You might try exporting the file to RTF or other compatible format 
for the transfer.

Can you try saving the file in "RTF" format? That is a text file, which 
includes formatting characters in text also....

	I have several address lists, with some overlap, that I want to 
pour into an overgroup that will get a single nickname. I could go into 
my sent-mail, each time I send something to an existing group, and use 
the take-address command to add to the overgroup -- if(!) I didn't mind 
waiting and could be sure to remember. But is there an efficient way?
	Related question: when I send a nonce message to two or three
groups, it seems pine chokes on any overlap (i.e., same name in two
groups). Is there an easy way to de-dup the to: list without going through
setting up an overgroup?

Yes... you can set your preferences in the Setup Configuration screen 
(Main Menu, then "S" followed by "C").  Look down the list and you'll see 
something like this:

addrbook-sort-rule     =
            Set       Rule Values
            ---   ----------------------
            ( )  fullname-with-lists-last

            (*)  nickname-with-lists-last
            ( )  nickname
	    ( )  dont-sort

Just select the sort order you want.

-- [ From: Leslie Bihary * EMC.Ver #2.10P ] --

I am a recent computere anthusiast, and having a pc system, I am an
completeley ignorant to the Unix system, but I am willing to learn.

First, please enlighten me as to the wonderfulness of the Unix system,
as I have read peoples'  testimonies to it, and the dedication to
develop it further, is truely remarkable. Now, I am really curious.

Second and specificely, I am avid browser of the Internet through the
Prodigy, AOL and Delphi, and recently "subscribed to a "publication"
which is mostly in MIME mode, and I can't read it.
Although, I consider myself a fairly inteligent human being, and
somewhat knowledgeable in the art of "computing", and after spending
many hours of downloading and "RFM", I am still at square one.

I have downloaded all five or more version of PINE and selecting the
PcPine-w which is the window version, but I could not make it run,
because a file called Winsock.dll was missing. All "read me" and
similar files say that "assuming" that we already have "Winsock/FTP/IP"
( or something like it)  which I don't have the faintest idea as to if
it is apple or orange, whether it is a program or a file. Nevertheless,
I have spent countless hours looking for this program/file, but no
avail.

Conclusion.
Gentlemen, what are we doing??? Is Unix in war against PC and MAC? For
years I have been able to receive and read massages in Ascii, txt, doc
and god knows how many more different languages, and all of a sudden (I
am sure its due to my own ignorance) I can't read an Intenet massage,
because its in MIME. Please forgive me, but I am frustrated as hell.
This reminds me of Babel. We have the knowhow, we have the technology,
and we now should have a universal computer language, that all people
understand, regardless of country, race, religion, sexual orientation
and whathaveyounot.

Are we going to have this??????????????????????????

Thank you for your time, and whatever assistant you can give me, so
that I may be able to read my Mime massages.

Wishing all of You God's speed and help for your continued efforts,
research and all Your future endevour.

Pine does not have this capability.  Use the "vacation" program or a
delivery filter program...

   PINE can't do this automatically. You need to use the "S" option
   to save it to a folder.

   To do it automatically use either "procmail" or "filter" program
   which comes with elm.

   Good Luck

    When you send it from your Mac to your Unix account, are you sending 
it as an ASCII or as a binary file?  I suppose you send flat text-only 
files as ASCII.  However, word-processor files often (not always) contain 
what are 8th-bit-set control characters with respect to the usual 7-bit 
ASCII used in the US.  If you are sending your word-processor file up as 
an ASCII, the transmission process may be scrambling or discarding some 
of the imbedded control characters.  Try sending it from Mac to Unix as a 
binary file and see if that makes any difference (if you haven't already 
tried it).

    This is a good suggestion.  At the same time, I wonder whether it is 
Pine that is fussing about quotation being longer than new material or 
the mail server.  Based on my USENET experiences, I suspect that the 
problem lies with your mail server rather than with Pine itself.  Some 
mail servers are fussier than others.

   You definitely don't need "root" access to install Pico, Pine. However
   you need to have root access if you need to run "imapd" as a daemon.

   To find out what kind of system you're on type "uname -a" or if available
   "whatami"

   IMHO downloading the "pine" and "pico" binaries will work fine for you.

   Good Luck

To my knowledge, the filter that determines the length of the quote simply
counts the number of lines that begin with ">", compared with those that
don't. If you simply replace all of the > with something else such as I 
have done below, then you can quite easily post something with more 
included text than new.   -Ian

If you add a customized header which says: 

	Return-Receipt-To:

to your message, most sendmail programs will send a receipt to any address
appearing after the header. If for example, you want the receipt to go to
yourself (the usual case, I imagine) then when writing a message, you'd
append your e-mail address to the header line, generating something like
this: 

Return-Receipt-To: pobart@access.digex.net

If you leave the space after "Return-Receipt-To:" blank, then no receipt
is generated. It should be emphasised that this does not work on all
systems since not _all_ systems support the Return-Receipt feature.  So,
if you get a receipt, your message was delivered (but not necessarily
read!), but if you do not get a receipt, that means that the message may
or may not have been delivered. 

To add this customized header, go to Setup/Config from the main pine menu
and scroll down to where it says "customized hdrs". Add Return-Receipt-To
to the list and then Exit. This need only be done once.  To use the
Return-Receipt feature when writing a message, use the Rich Header command
(^R) while the cursor is in the header area of the Compose Message or the
Compose Message Reply page. Enter the e-mail address of the person to 
receive the receipt (most likely you) after the "Return-R:" line.

For some reason, pine is stripping the return site and
appending the local system name to the end of the From
line and therefore replies are not working.  

For example, when I send a test message from a site called 
utsi.edu the From line reads:

From:  Julie VanHooser <jvanhoos@hap.arnold.af.mil>

it should read

From:  Julie VanHooser <jvanhoos@utsi.edu>


So that when I try to reply I get an error message back stating
Returned mail: User unknown.
What did I do wrong in configuring the mail system?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.


Thanks,

    Thanks for responding.  As it turns out, someone else beat you to the 
punch with essentially the same answer.  I admit that I was already aware 
of this technique.  However, it works if and ONLY if the receiving mailer 
is set up to process and use the return-receipt header line.  Many totally 
ignore it, in which case it accomplishes nothing whatever.  Although I do 
not have any figures, I have the hunch that many non-Unix-based mailers 
do not honor the return-receipt request.  Somehow I had the idea, 
obviously mistakenly, that you were claiming to have found a way to 
coax/coerce a delivery receipt out of ANY receiving system.

Thanks again.

Subject: Odd problem with pine.
Status: O
X-Status: 

Hello all...

I'v developed a strange problem with pine....

I'm using pine on a Sparc20 with Sol2.3. I've not implemented IMAP. It's only
one machine, and I'm just using it as a front end to sendmail 8.6.9 (I know...)

Everything's been working fine until last Thursday, when, for some reason pine
will not send any user's mail. Outgoing mailjust sits in the /var/tmp
directory. It will allow the root account to send mail, however.

A user can still go into /var/tmp and use the command...

((/usr/lib/sendmail -oi -oem -t; /bin/rm -f /var/tmp//pinesendXXXXXX) <
/var/tmp//pinesendXXXXXX &)

to finish off the mail and send it. ( I got that command line from
the .pine-debug file.)

Comparing the debug files between root and a user sending performing the same
actions doesn't show any differences... pine still lies and tells the user
that the mail has been sent.

I'm assuming since root can send mail still through pine, it probably is a
permission problem somewhere... but I have been unable to find it.

Thanks in advance for any help... (please reply by e-mail, our news service
at WU is not always consistent.)

  Pine and Pico are seperate binaries and it's possible to use PICO for
  editing purposes. Several people over here use PICO just for editing.

  Good Luck

No, it's not your mail server, it's PINE.  Now I'm not using pine right
now, and I could end this message here and say G'day, which if you notice
my original response was 3 lines to an 8 line quote, but if I were using
pine I would either have to cut out some of the quotes or I would say: 

well,

   Most of the UNIX systems support it, you don't need PINE to accomplish
   this.

   Simply do the following:

   Create a file called ".vacation.msg" with a "Subject:" line, like

   Subject: away from my mail

   I will not be reading my mail for a while.
   Your mail regarding "$SUBJECT" will be read when I return

   Thanks

   Tom


  To start vacation, create  a  .forward  file  in  your  home
  directory containing a line of the form:

         \username, "|/usr/ucb/vacation username"

   where username is your login name.

   Then type in the command:

    vacation -I

   To stop vacation, remove the .forward file, or move it to  a
   new name.

Jonathan,
You are mistaken.
The "quote longer than reply" error msg does NOT come from Pine.
But it's not from your mail server either... it's from your nntp server.

Pine has anticipated this kind of difficulty and allows one to work
around it, by accepting 2 presses of the Escape key in lieu of the Ctrl
key in any pine Ctrl-key sequence.  Thus, you could invoke your
alternate editor by means of Esc Esc _ (Escape Escape underscore).

If you put the reply-to line in customized-hdrs but not in
default-composer-hdrs then it will only show up if you type a ^R in the
headers.  (There are bugs in 3.90 and you would do well to upgrade to
3.91.)

An address list can have nicknames in the address field, so you can have
a list which is made up of other lists, for example

list       list1, list2

list1      a, b, c
list2      d, e, list3, list4, ...

The expansion isn't done until you use the list so additions to list1
will be reflected in list when you use it.  (but maybe you already knew
all that)

The working assumption was that the MTA would do the de-dup'ing of the
recipient list so that it wasn't necessary for Pine to attempt it.  For
example, sendmail will do this for you.  What is the nature of the choke?

Check the file permissions of the directiories that pine is trying to 
write to. Most likely u dont have write permission.

	Well, let's say I expected it, having dealt with a lesser mailer 
internally.

	MTA? Mail Transport Something? What is it, & where?
	The choke appears to be in pine: I type a list of nicknames of 
lists into the TO: field, and when I cursor down, it fills up with error 
messages. I've only tried it once, and it looked such a mess to clean up 
that I forwent the message -- or rather, sent it to one group, and then 
forwarded it (with deletion of headers) to each other one separately out 
of my sent-mail. 
	Is there any problem, in your example, if e and list3 are both 
themselves nicknames? Or could I have fouled up somehow? (Do you need to 
use enter rather than down-arrow to expand, for instance?)

Whenever I use Pine, my name appears in quotation marks as "Peter H.

blank and get the same result.  My entry in /etc/passwd doesn't have quotes 
either.  Other people in my firm don't get this.  Anybody know why?  

Thanks!

Hi there,

just a short question about the pine program:

Is there a possibility to 'catch up' (=mark all articles
of a newsgroup as read) a newsgroup?

If yes, I would be happy if someone could send me how to do
by email!!!

Thanks,
Andy

Simple.  Only a certain selection of characters are allowed in names 
according to RFC 822.  Yours contains an "illegal" character (the full 
stop) and so must be enclosed in quotes to make it acceptable.

Change your personal name information to "Peter H Lemieux" and everything 
should be wonderful for you.

You should get hold of the standard for the format of Internet messages,
rfc822. which is available from internic.ds.net, in the category RFC.

This standard specifies that the explanatory username, if it is in an
address field, must not contain a period, unless the whole explanatory
phrase is enclosed in parentheses.  The reason is that the period is
an important, meaningful symbol in the machine-readable address.

For example, the following To fields are okay:
 
To: rjones@alpha.beta.widgets.com
To: Robert Jones <rjones@alpha.beta.widgets.com>
To: R Jones <rjones@alpha.beta.widgets.com>

BUT the following To field is not okay:

To: R. Jones <rjones@alpha.beta.widgets.com>       WRONG!!!

RFC822 requires that the field be rewritten as:

To: "R. Jones" <rjones@alpha.beta.widgets.com>     OKAY!!!

This rule is designed to let the software parse the part of the
address field that is not enclosed in parentheses.

The rule didn't have to be this way, and it is not an intuitively
understandable or graceful design, but it IS a standard.  Be glad you
have an automatic mail agent that puts your address in the correct
form.

	You should call you system administrator and ask him what is your

I had already checked the file permissions because, just as you thought,
that is what the problem looks like.  After much research and trying different

perfectly now.  Several months ago I upgraded sendmail, but I must not have 
upgraded sendmail.cf.

Agent.  It is the program that transports the mail from one end to the
other, as opposed to a Mail User Agent (like Pine).  However, it sounds
like you're never getting to the MTA, so the problem is in pine or your
address book.

Should be no problem with e and list3 being nicknames, or down-arrow.
There is a problem if there is a loop in the lists.  For example:

list      list1, list2

list1     list3, list4

list3     list1

would be a problem because list1 refers to list3 which refers to
list1...  The loop might involve more than two lists, too.  The lists may
be nested arbitrarily deep but there can't be any loops or you'll get an
error.  If none of this explains the problem, feel free to send me an
address book (as an attachment) that exhibits the problem and I'll see if
I can understand it.  Thanks.

Before we begin, I would like to inform you that I have read the 
documention entirely.  

I cannont seem to figure out how to use Pine to make posts to my 
newsgroups.  I'm sure there are some properties I must alter in the Pine 
Setup/Config area, but I do not know what.  I am a rather experience 
computer user, etc, but I cannot seem to figure out this one detail.

When I attempt to send posts to my newsgroup, Pine replys that my 
newsgroup is not validated or something similiar.  In the headers area, I 
press ^R to bring up the advanced header.  Under the newsgroup area, I 
type alt.test to make a test post to the alt.test newgroup, but it fails.

Please reply via post or e-mail as soon as you read this, assuming you 
have the answer.

Michael,

Pine and MIME are usually pretty good about not corrupting information. I
suspect that the problem may lie elsewhere. 

	The first thing to check is to make sure that you really saved the
mac file in a format that MS Word for Windows can read. One of the
numerous available formats for the mac is "MS Word for Windows 2.0". This
format is easily read by an IBM PC or clone and is what we use when
transferring files from one system to the other via disk. If you haven't
already done so, try saving your file in that format and then send it off
to your friend by the procedure you described below. 

If that doesn't work, try binhex-ing the Word-for-Windows document before
sending it off. That will convert the file from binary to ASCII, which
should preserve it from being corrupted by either sz or pine. If you do
this, you can even skip the sz phase entirely by pasting the contents of
the binhex'd file (as read by teachtext) directly into an outgoing mail
message from your mac. Your friend will have to find a way to un-binhex
the file on his/her PC. I am afraid that I really don't know what
applications are available for the PC to do this, but I suspect that there
are some. 

Note that many of the fonts on macs and PCs are copyrighted (or whatever)
and have no direct equivalent on the other system. Some of your special
characters may not have a direct equivalent on the PC. Since Microsoft
writes Word for both systems as well as Windows for the PC, MS Word 6.x
for the mac comes with some of the Windows fonts as part of the
application, but I seriously doubt that Word for Windows comes with mac
fonts as part of it. As a result, it may be much easier to send files from
PC to mac than the other way around. 

				Good Luck!

Sure, that's what they all say :^)

You should be able to use the suspend key. CTRL-Z 

That will put you at the unix prompt, to return to pine type fg and press
return. (that means foreground, since you have stopped pine with the
suspend command)

To look at your list of active jobs under the current shell, type jobs at 
the unix prompt.

Have a nice day!

	There must have been a loop in there somewhere, since edited out; 
I can't seem to make it do it again, even by combining the longest lists 
into one TO: field.
	But it's still good to know what to avoid, and how. For this help 
much thanks!

Hello, we are using Pine 3.91 on a SOLARIS 2.4 Sparc 20, which is using
smail3.1.29 as the transport. Whenever I send a message to a person on the
system, it fills in @hostname instead of @hostname.domain, and does this
in the reply to field also, so that mail is going out as if were from
user@hostname instead of using user@hostname.domain.
Therefore mail fails to return to me properly. ARGH.

`hostname` returns the hostname
`domainname` returns the domain name

Where does pine look to find out the Fully Qualified Domain Name?

Here's my setup:

On my account which is housed on a timesharing machine I have my mail/ directory
with all my mail folders.  

I am using my own Sun workstation so I;d like to be able to utilize the available
space on it.  I have setup a Folder-collection <cloud> on it with no problems and
can read the info stored there.  I can also save messages from my <mail>
collection to my <cloud> collection if I use the ^T feature to list my folders in
the <cloud> collection after I issue the 's'ave command.

My problem is that I can't figure out how to save to my <cloud> collection into
a new folder.

Anyone know the syntax or steps?
Thanks,
Jim...

And if any of the list recipient's email/Internet provider charges
extra for sending Internet mail, those people will have to pay for your
return receipt.

   Put the following line in your ".cshrc" file and even if PINE crashes
   the size of core file generated will be 0.

   limit coredumpsize 0

   Remember "core" files are generated whenever a program crashes. So
   it holds for Pine, Mosaic.......and if you are an ordinary user, you
   don't need to worry about core files.

   Good Luck

You first need to enable-suspend in your configuration.  Then ^Z
will suspend pine.  If that doesn't work, suspending may have been
disabled by your system administrator.

You can't reply to me using the Reply feature in Pine, because if you

rallen@knight.city.ba.k12.md.us.  (Try it!)  Does anyone know where this 
information 
is stored?  There's nothing like that in my pine.conf file.  Should there 
be a line like Reply-To-Host=knight.city.ba.k12.md.us?  Is there 
something like that in another file?  We are a new site and are running 
Pine 3.91.

Thank you for replying (or at least trying).

I recently downloaded the MSDOS version of Pine (pcpine_f.zip.  I don't 
have my own network, and access E-mail through my Unix account.  The only 
reason I wanted it was for the DOS version of the Pico editor, to use as 
my message editor in conjunction with the Blue Wave Offline Mail Reader.  
Those word-processing programs I would have chosen are too big to fit in 
memory, and the two alternatives, TED3 (The editor that comes with BW) 
and MSDOS's editor do not support the word-wrap, which leves me to worry 
about new lines while losing my train of thought while I write.

Now that I have it, this is my question:  I saw no documentation, and no 
license or registration form.  What status does PC-Pine have?  And also, 
since I deleted all files except Pico.exe, what would be the legal 
difference.  Even freeware usually has some stipulation, but I am unclear 
of what I am now expected to do.  Please let me know.  Thank you very much.

Is there a way to reconstruct Pine mail folders and headers?  

While extracting/saving some messages from a large archive file, 
my system crashed and now I can't open the message folder.
The folder file is intact and I can read it fine as text, but Pine chokes
and is unable to open it.  Pine just reutrns the message "Folder xxx reopened"
where xxx is the previously opened folder.

Any suggestions?

Thanks

There is a SLS (I dont remember the exact filename right now) you have to

	THE KEY TO ORGANIZING YOUR HEALTH RECORDS

"If you care about yourself and your children, you will do everything you
can to know your family's medical history. It can save your life, and the
lives of those who are dear to you." -- Dr. Aubry Milunsky, Director,
Boston University's Center for Human Genetics (Life Magazine, March,
1995). 

Your Lifetime Health Planner offers the simplest, most effective way to
take charge of your health.  Enter important facts about your health
history, keep a record of the names of medications and their effects,
document each doctor visit and diagnosis.  You will have the information
you need, and in the event of an emergency, so will your family. 

Your Lifetime Health Planner, 198 pages in a compact, loose-leaf binder,
contains a variety of sections which include "Doctor Visits,"
"Medications," "Family Health History," and "Doctors and Specialists." 
The Planner is a must for the busy executive who needs to stay organized,
for seniors who are receiving care and for newborns who need a record of
their health care. 

Parents Magazine recommended the Planner to its readers (April, 1994) and
MCI called it "a useful resource in managing your personal health
records."  Margie Smotherman, Coordinator, Employee Health and Wellness,
Blue Shield/Blue Cross of Iowa, said: "The employees felt that these
(Planners) were great tools to not only record their pertinent numbers,
but to plan for doctor's visits."

         Now that I know how to combine addressee lists (thanks,
    friends!), I'd like to know if there's a way I can tell pine to
    take one of the lists in my addressbook ( a list which is a hash of full
    names, nicknames, and actual addresses) and alphabetize it --
    preferably once on each -- so that I can de-dup it.
         I understand that, so long as I have no loops, I can address
    a message to two groups, and pine will send only once to those
    individuals who are on both.
         But there's another problem.  The trillium list (composed of
    hunters, hikers, squash players, out-of-towners, and sundry more)
    is so long that I want to be able to scan it, in the .addressbook
    and in headers, for people I may have left out -- and all those
    otherwise harmless duplications make the scanning an exercise in
    beard-ripping.  If I could once de-dup it thoroughly, the
    scanning ought to become a breeze.

   Probably not. What you can do is to put your name in the "To: "

Subject: Odd problem with pine.
Status: O
X-Status: 

Hello all...

I'v developed a strange problem with pine....

I'm using pine on a Sparc20 with Sol2.3. I've not implemented IMAP. It's only
one machine, and I'm just using it as a front end to sendmail 8.6.9 (I know...)

Everything's been working fine until last Thursday, when, for some reason pine
will not send any user's mail. Outgoing mailjust sits in the /var/tmp
directory. It will allow the root account to send mail, however.

A user can still go into /var/tmp and use the command...

((/usr/lib/sendmail -oi -oem -t; /bin/rm -f /var/tmp//pinesendXXXXXX) <
/var/tmp//pinesendXXXXXX &)

to finish off the mail and send it. ( I got that command line from
the .pine-debug file.)

Comparing the debug files between root and a user sending performing the same
actions doesn't show any differences... pine still lies and tells the user
that the mail has been sent.

I'm assuming since root can send mail still through pine, it probably is a
permission problem somewhere... but I have been unable to find it.

Thanks in advance for any help... (please reply by e-mail, our news service
at WU is not always consistent.)

	Since I have yet to find a way to read mime-encoded material 
outside pine (and my correspondents' lack of such sophistication likely 
exceeds even mine), I tried sending the same file two ways to one of my 
other mailers: once by naming it on the attachment line, and once by 
using the read-file command in the body of the message.
	Sure enough, the first got mime-encoded and the other didn't. 
	What seems very odd is that the message with the encoded file was 
34K, while the one with it in clear was only 24K. Now, if mime is among 
other things a replacement for uuencode, and uuencode functions among 
other things to *compress* a message ...

  Thanks very much to the following people for helping me to diagnose
  this problem:

    Rick Crelia <rcrelia@ucns.uga.edu>
    Terry Gray <gray@cac.washington.edu>
    Larry Miller [DT] <lmiller@cibnor.conacyt.mx>
    Mary Odom <modom@cbacc.cba.uga.edu>
    David Quarterman <dlq@uga.edu>
    Don Sugarman <sugarman@mmpcs1.PSF.GE.COM>

  When sending mail in Pegasus, you can select a "special" button.  Under
  the special area, is a yes/no choice for whether or not to use MIME.  By
  default, it's set to no.  No matter how you have this yes/no setting
  configured, you still have to choose a type like "MIME GIF" or "MIME
  JPEG" when including an attachment with your note.  If you do include an
  attachment but have the "no" choice selected for MIME, then the note is
  sent with all the MIME headers and separators, but without the crucial
  "MIME-Version" header.  This seems pretty strange and confusing to me.
  Does anyone know why there should be an option to send MIME attachments
  *without* the "MIME-Version" header?

  Thanks again for all the help.

Hi,

This may be an incredibly ignorant question, if so, I apologise.

On pegasus mail, there is a function whereby you can get notification that
your mail has actually been delivered to the other person's server. Is there
any such function on Pine?

This becomes a very useful feature when people's servers go down, because it
enables you to ascertain whether your message has actually reached its
destination. I have encountered this problem recently.

Thanks,
Robyn

	We are establishing a front-end server to our campus network so
that the entire campus community can use the same e-mail software.  The
requirements for this software are:

	1. Run on a DEC Alpha system with OSF/1 (Digital UNIX).
	2. Easy to use for regular users and support personnel.
	3. Download capabilty to PCs, Macs, and UNIX systems 
	   (all three) and preferably automatic when the systems 
	   are on or are turned on.
	4. Send and receive documents created in word processors 
	   on the PC, Mac, or UNIX systems.

	If you have any suggestions for the type of software package to use,
how and where to obtain it, and/or any experiential information, we like to
hear from you.

I don't think it is accurate to say that uuencode compresses the 
message.  The encoding process, pine or otherwise, splits 8-bit bites 
into 4-bit chunks and concatentates with 000s to make a 7-bit bites.  The 
decoder recombines the right 4 bits into 8-bit bites at the other end.  
Though there may be some optimization, the primary function is to push 
8-bit bytes through a 7-bit wire.  For that reason, the file size grows.

Let me know if you need the dos or unix standalone versions of 
mpack/munpack, and I will e-mail them.  (Be sure to let me know if you 
want them as a MIMEd Pine attachment or uuencoded.)

I have an MS-Mail gateway for SMTP, version 3.0. Is it the latest version ?

An error occurs when establishing a connection with extended mail routers.

The external SMTP router says EHLO, my MS-gateway doesn't understand it and 
closes connection. At this point, any further communication becomes impossible.
This error isn't documented by MS.
The question is: What configuration must I have for my gateway to solve this 
problem ?

PLEASE REPLY TO:

mean?  Only this folder cause this message to pop up, but there is no

Hi,

Is there a way of customizing the From: field in outgoing messages
sent by Pine? This question is for a friend at Columbia University who
needs help customizing Pine.

At Columbia you are assigned a login id like "ab123". So Pine sets the
"From" field to "From: ab123@columbia.edu". 

This works just fine, but my friend would like to change the from
field to include the actual name (so that, for eg, the field would
read "From: John.Smith@columbia.edu"). We've checked that the mail
server at Columbia accepts this address and delivers the mail
correctly to the "ab123" mailbox.

I am specifically interested in having a different "From:" field in
all outgoing messages -- that is, I am not interested in putting in a
"Reply-To" field. Basically, when the Reply-To field is inserted, the
person receiving the messages still sees the very unmnemonic
"ab123@columbia.edu" when reading the message. We would like to banish
"ab123" from all mention.

Please email me, I'll summarize on the newgroup.

Sam

I've tried to open remote mail boxes on a Sun and IBM/AIX machines.  One 
is running a POP3 server and the other an IMAP server.  I try and open 
the remote mailbox with the following command in the folder section:

		{remote.host}INBOX

In both cases, I get an error after a short period of time saying "Can 
not open INBOX. File already exists!" (or words to that effect).

If I try,

		{remote.host}"INBOX"

Then the file INBOX is created on the remote host.

Can anyone tell me what the deal is?

			thanks, bill

H,

        The doc says that you cant use  -I string  in INSERT mode.

        After pine read your  "r"  it DOES replay and now it is in
	compose screen  - that is, INSERT mode.  In the same way you
	cant locate message have "Hello" in his subject and read it
        by this way:  -I i,wHello,CR,v   The "w" put pine in INSERT
	mode.

Was following the recent thread on getting a Rtrn Rcpt for email that 
one sends.  I decided to give it a shot.  Works great, but;

I just sent an email off to a mailing list, and a min later I am getting 
bombarded with return receipts from the mailing list recipients!  I know 
this list has about 1000+ members, I am wondering if I will be getting 
that many rtrn rcpts.  Oh well, live and learn.  :)

Best to all,

Try this:

         compress .newsrc
         zcat .newsrc.Z | tr ":" "\!" > .newsrc

That should UN-subscribe all groups.  Now, use Pine's menu to subscribe to
the groups you want.  Alternatively, you can edit .newsrc and change the !
to : on the groups you want.

I am running Linux and just installed pine 3.91 and I am having problems 
when trying to do the following....

pine -f {mailhost.primenet.com}/var/mail/cj

It tries to do a rsh command to mailhost.primenet.com.  This is the 
command that it is trying to exec...

rsh mailhost.primenet.com exec /etc/rimapd

It hangs for a long time and times out.  I have access to mailhost and 
there is no program called /etc/rimapd, nor is it in any other directory.

If I use the pine 3.91 on another machine, it works fine.  It logs into 
the imapd and gets my mail.  It just does not work on my Linux machine.  
I there something that I need to reset or delete from my old 3.89 
settings, I have tried to delete the .pinerc files, and still no help.

I was told that pine 3.91 fixes this problem.  Can anyone give me assistance?

Fixed in the latest version, regardless of what MSFT says over the phone.
Pick up V3.0.9 from ftp.microsoft.com. It doesn't do this any more. Also
has a new "-F" flag that makes the MS Mail appear to come from *the
sender* instead of the last re-mailer. Oooo! What a concept!

That is can you send out to a list of people so that they

It's quite large (2+ Mbytes compressed).  You're better off using

I recently picked up Pine 3.91 for PC-NFS, but have been unable to get it
to work.  Pine 3.89 works just fine.  The problem seems to be something to
do with Pine being unable to find the mail host.  I used the same pinerc file
as was used with Pine 3.89, so there should be no problem ...


Any comments?

Alexis.

Thanks for the corrections.

The funny thing is that I wasn't told this by the support people, but by the
very engineering folks who were responsible for maintaining the gateway.  This
was almost a year ago.  It would appear that someone turned up the heat in an
effort to placate customers who are getting tired waiting for MS Exchange.

The most likely cause of this is a broken system configuration.  In
particular, it is very likely that your /etc/hosts has an entry that looks
like
	129.25.3.11	dunx1 dunx1.ocs.drexel.edu
whereas the correct entry would be:
	129.25.3.11	dunx1.ocs.drexel.edu dunx1

This is a very common mistake.  Unfortunately, some sorcerer's apprentices
have spread folklore to the effect that the incorrect form is what you
should use.

The incorrect entry causes the gethostbyname() call to return the
non-qualified name as the "official" name, which in turn will also cause
the bad results in Pine.

This is possible but requires a rebuild of pine from the source code.  To 
do this find the relevant OS specific file for your variant of Unix 
(normally in pine3.91/pine/osdep/os-*.h) and uncomment the line which has 
the following:
	
	#define ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM

You then recompile pine.  Once this is done you will have to add a 
customised header for your From: line.

The source file pine/imap/ANSI/c-client/nntpcunx.c contains the commands
used by Pine's NNTP client.  Look for calls to smtp_send().

If you run Pine as "pine -d9" you should get a transcript of the NNTP
protocol session as part of the .pine-debug* files.  You can look at that
and see what is happening.

Unfortunately, "cannot get PINE to communicate with it" is much too vague
a statement, as is "something the NNTP server is missing".  If the NNTP
server implements the NNTP specification, *and* does not do something
stupid such as close the connection when it receives an unknown command
(Pine does use some non-specified but commonly-implemented commands such
as XHDR), then it should work with Pine.

Yes, but only for news articles posted to a news server whose software 
has been configured to reject articles with more included material than 
"fresh".  A lot of news servers are not configured like this (our was, 
until I changed it!).  You can be as "inclusive" as you like when sending 
e-mail.

Interesting question:

If someone has sent out a verbose article/message and you reply including 
large portions of it with little "fresh" material, does this make you 
verbose by association?  :-)

Start PINE, press S and then C to enter configuration screen. You'll now 
see a lot of configurable options, use arrow key to move down until you 
see option "customized-hdrs="  Press A to add value to it. You should add

Reply-To: rallen@knight.city.ba.k12.md.us

Another way that you might prefer is to set the value in option 
"user-domain".  You can set it to "knight.city.ba.k12.md.us" and it will 
be used in From: line for all your outgoing mail.

Hope this help.

Last weekend our T1 line was out due to a power outage or some other 
malfunction and so we were cut off from the outside internet.  During 
that time Pine would take nearly two minutes to load up.  I tried 
checking with the debug options on pine to see what it was doing, and as 
far as I can tell it was either trying to ping the localhost or connect 
to the smtp server on the localhost (I should note that during the 
problem that if we tried telnetting or pinging ourselves it would connect 
but only after a long wait).  So does anyone know why pine needs to make 
a tcpip connection during startup?

I have had a similar problem trying to set Pine for Windows up with 
access to our mail server. It turned out that our mail server was not 
running an imap or sntp server (imapd). PC pine uses the imap protocol 
and sntp and therefore requires the remote machine that you are trying
to access supports both of these.

Thanks to all who replied.  Most people suggested making changes to my 
pine.rc file, which I'm sure would have worked.  I was setting this up 
for the whole system as root, so I really needed to change the pine.conf 
file.  The magic solution was:  Add a line in pine.conf that reads:

user-domain=knight.city.ba.k12.md.us

Thanks to all who responded.

I've noticed a few messages mention mkpgp, a Pine/PGP interface.
Could someone fill me in on this package, how it interfaces to
Pine, and where it can be obtained?  Are there any alternatives?

Thanks,

This is all well and good guys (Hi Carl!), but I have to wonder what this
has to do with half of the newsgroups to which this is being cross-posted. 
comp.mail.misc I can certainly see, and I can see arguments for some of the
MTA-related newsgroups like comp.mail.sendmail, but comp.mail.zmail?!? 
C'mon, this is a competing MUA!


I'm beginning to think I should push to have comp.mail.* reorganized into
comp.mail.mta.* and comp.mail.mua.*, so that we can separate out some of
these MUAs that can make use of most any MTA (and vice-versa), plus this
would also let us have comp.mail.mta.advocacy and a comp.mail.mua.advocacy
newsgroups, which I think would be more in line with the Usenet tradition.

Thoughts?

No, I believe there is one later version.

Yup.  If the very first command to the MS server isn't HELO, it drops the
connection, end of discussion.  Microsoft had no plans to fix this.

Prompted by the auto response to the B cmd, I'm initiating these 
questions/comments on Pine.
	How do you edit a previously sent e-mail if:
a)  the address needs a change   or
b)  the text needs mods?

	Is there a description of what all the options in configure
 accomplish?
***I just noticed that the above sentence didnot wrap and display 
properly until I inserted a CR after "configure".***

Specifically, I wondered if I could prevent repetition of the notice that 
i'm at the beginning (or end) of a list, after I've depressed a key for 
long enough to seem like many strokes.  After all, Pine seems to 
recognize the futility of my action.

	I've also had difficulties removing characters in the middle of
 previously typed paragraphs.  Is there a clear explanation of the 
correct process?  In a related matter, why does "Delete" act like 
"Backspace"? rather than removing the character under the cursor.  The 
cleanest way I've found to date is to backspace (and remove) over 
characters, thus forcing a need to retype them, rather than "left arrow" 
and delete.

	Hope this is coherent and has answers, and I pray that not tooo 
many replies result.

John,

I have successfully ported the c-client stuff from cac.washington to 
the Win32 platform. This was easy. The mtest program worked fine also.

Were you thinking of IMAP2 or IMAP4?

It sounds like what you really want to do is Forward a message. 
Forwarding lets you add text to the message before forwarding in on.

Has anyone had a problem with wrapping on the 80th character of the VAX/VMS port
of Pine?

I'm running the Huji beta 5 of 3.91; it seems that on any inverse line, the 
80th character wraps to the first column of the next line, and all other 
characters ending on the 80th column are erased.  

Please note that this is consistant over a modem connection, and even locally
off of terminals; I am in VT100 mode.

Any help is greatly appreciated!

Believe it or not, I actually got it to successfully build under AIX
4.1.2.  I had to use the 3.2.5 compatibility stuff and termcap, but it
did build.  I can tar the binaries up for you if you'd like.

I've gotten a few complaints and it seems to focus around some of the

I would like pine to automatically place mail that is sent to specific 
mailing lists into separate mail boxes in pine. 
For example: I am suscribed to the AD&D-l list, and would like all the 
messages that are addressed to this not to appear in INBOX, so as to keep 
this mail separate from personal mail. If somebody could help me I would 
greatly appreciate it!

Pete,

I don't know wether you have had a reply or solved the problem by now 
however:

>I built pine, pico, ipop2d, ipop3d and imapd at the same time.
>I then added the appropriate lines to /etc/inet/inetd.conf.

The ID of the port in inetd.conf must match the one associated with the 
port number in /etc/services. So if in /etc/services you have

imap2    143/tcp
imap2    143/ucp
^^^^^
then in inetd.conf you should have something like

imap2    stream  tcp  nowait   root  /bin/imapd   imapd
^^^^^

I had 'imap2' in one and 'imap' in the other and had to make them the 
same to make it work. Make sure that the specified path to the binary is 
correct and pointing to the relevant binary. Make sure that the binary
has been copied to the correct location (e.g. /usr/sbin or /bin)

>However, telnetting into ports 109 and 143 doesn't work
>("connection refused") although telnetting into port 110 is fine.

Also make sure that the sendmail demon has been re-set and restarted.
Hope this info is of some use!

The blind copy, or bcc: function is easy to find -- just press Ctrl-R for
"rich header."  (You have to be in the header when you press it;
otherwise, ctrl-r is the key for retrieving documents).  Put your list
name there, and you're halfway done.  The second step is to put something
in the To: line.  I suggest

Distribution List <youraddress@yourhost>

If you do that, everything is jake.  But if you put nothing in the To:
line, everyone on your list will gets a copy of the entire list, displaced
to the bcc: line.  Why, I don't know.  But the function does work 
perfectly with that adjustment.

Good luck,

Michael

And be sure imapd is executable (do chmod a+x imapd at an appropriate=20
directory).

Subject: We Resrict users to /usr/local/rbin - How can 'spell' work?
Date: 25 May 1995 20:54:01 GMT
Message-Id: <3q2qp9$1k6@detroit.freenet.org>

X-Status: 


Hi

We have a restricted, not chroot I *must* add, environment where users
can only execute programs in /usr/local/rbin.  This includes Pine, Lynx
their menus, cp, rm etc etc.  Users execute Pine from a menu - so typing
a number spawns /usr/local/rbin/pine.  Everything works like a charm
except for spell (^T).  We have tried moving /usr/bin/spell into
/usr/local/rbin (as well as all the programs used by spell) but still
no cigar.  When ^T is invoked Pine simply echoes back "Done Checking
Spelling" with no corrections made.  When I run Pine in a command tool I
see "sh: /usr/bin/spell: restricted" - this does not surprise me as we
are not giving users access to /usr/bin!!!!

Now, what I need is some good advice on how to make Pine look for 'spell'
in the users path NOT by looking for /usr/bin/spell.  Has anyone hacked
the source successfully (we tried that too) ?? Or can any Pine developers
who read this group explain where I would change the code.

Please help.

I can use RICH HEADER when composing email that lets me enter blind cc's 
and also indicate what folder to save the sent message to.  You have to 
use CTRL-R when the cursor is in the address / upper section of the 
compose screen.

Hope this is of help.

How do you get the users ID to be equal to the login name in PC pine?

I am trying to set up a PC which will be used by a number of people to
access their mail accounts on a remote server. The problem is that the 
users name that appears in the 'from' field of the e-mail header is 
always whatever is set in user-id in the config options regardles of what 
the user logs in with. How do I overide this with the log in name?

Sure. Just do a CTRL-R to load in a file (into --Message Text--) and type
in .addressbook in the space provided. Or just attach it by typing
.addressbook into the Attchmnt: field.

pine-bin.a32 is for AIX 3.2.  I have tested it briefly on a 4.1 system we
now have and it seems to work...

Good explanation up to this point, but it is the inetd daemon than needs
to be restarted, not sendmail...

This depends on what Mail Transport Agent (MTA) you are using, e.g.
sendmail, smail, mmdf, pp, etc.  What symptoms do you get when you try to
use the system you sent this message from?

I'm not sure what Pegasus is using, but it is probably just adding a
Return-Receipt-To: header.  You can do this in Pine on the Setup/Config
screen by adding it to the customized-hdrs entry.  Note that many servers
do not reply to that header, thus making it of questionable value...

You can force Pine to skip trying rsh by changing the above command to

	pine -f {mailhost.primenet.com:143}/var/mail/cj

or better yet

	pine -f {mailhost.primenet.com:143}INBOX

Is it possible that Pine was waiting for DNS nameserver timeouts?

Pine and Pico are indeed freeware.  There is no registration form to fill
out.  About the only restrictions are that you respect the Pine and Pico
trademarks and copyrights or the University of Washington and don't use it
commercially (i.e. don't sell it) without prior consent.

Before your menu calls Pine, have it set the SPELL environment variable to
/usr/local/rbin/spell.

Pine does not support KILL files.  They may be supported in a future
release but probably not real soon...

Yes.  Just mail the file ".addressbook" from the user's account as an 
attachment, and unpack it into the same place on the target account.  
This has worked for us here going from one Unix system to another without 
a hitch.  The format is the same on all the platforms.  DOS may be 
different, though, I don't know.  Anyway, make sure that they don't mind 
losing what's in their existing addressbook when they bring over their 
other one.  Merging them is a little more difficult, but can probably be 
achieved by unpacking the addressbook into a different file name and then 
catting it onto the end of the existing addressbook.

Hello,
	I login in Unix and read mail by pine. I saved the mail in the 
folders. Is that posssible to read the folders in PC like reading it in 
pine. I heard there is something called PC-pine. Is the purpose of the 
PC-pine can provide the facilities that I requested?

many mail at home.

I am having a problem with pine 3.91 and linux using imap.  When I try to 
access my mailbox it tries to run a remote shell command to execute 
/etc/rimapd.  It hangs for a long time.  This was originally happening 
with pine 3.89 and I saw a post saying that 3.91 fixes that problem, but 
no luck after installing 3.91.  

It works fine for the same imap server from a BSD machine running 3.91 on 
our network.  Can anyone help?  I am pretty desperate at this point.

That's an OK solution.  Could you expand on it a little bit?  There must
be a way when building pine to say that -d0 (no debug files) is the default,
yet when I built 3.91, I didn't see any specific documentation referring to
what files could be used for customizing the build.  The default, evidently,
is to produce the debug files; what I'd like is just the opposite.

uuencode compresses messages?  I haven't seen that.  You sure?

Someone posted an article asking for the Legal status of Pine. The 
article seems to have since disappeared from the list. The following is 
an excerpt from the technical notes for Pine which have to be downloaded

I'm a new user of Pine (only started using it this month), and would like 
to know if Pine has any utilities for redirecting mail to specific 
folders based on their subject or their sender.
If Pine lacks such utilities, are there others that can do the same 
thing?  If the only thing that will do the job is the utility "filter", 
examples of rules files would be greatly appreciated.

Hi:  I usually read my email using Eudora on a Macintosh.  However, when
I'm on the road I log in via a simple terminal emulator and have been
using ELM to read my mail.  ELM is OK except for having to use the vi or
emacs editor which is pretty bad.  I have tried using PINE which seems a
lot better, HOWEVER, I have this problem:

When I used to use ELM I was able to leave my ,messages untouched even
though I had read some of the messages, by exiting via "X" rather than via
"Q".  This then allowed me to read ALL of the messages (both the unread
and the previously read ones) with Eudora when I got back to the office.

I haven't been able to do this using PINE.  Any message that was
"previously read" is ignored by Eudora.  I can't find anything on the WWW
site FAQ about this.  I'm sure it's a simple matter, but being too simple,
I haven't figured it out yet.

Any help will be appreciated.  Please email me (gaba@hpp.stanford.edu)
rather than posting, although I will check this group for a while.

Thanks,

Subject: PINE, please don't generate headers

Message-Id: <3q5kll$5pa@ocean.CAM.ORG>
Status: O
X-Status: 

Quite a while ago, I noticed that the message IDs of the messages coming
from PINE do not use the FQDN of the sending host. The reason? It does
a simple uname() call (or something similar, I forget) to fetch the
node name, which is not the FQDN.

I left this alone because it's not a big deal. But IMHO it would be better
to not generate any such headers and leave the task to the MTS. That's how
it works with most/all other MUAs.

Recently, I ran into the same problem with From: lines. Not all of our
users live under the same domain name. We have some which are mapped to
other names (different domain name, possibly different username) using
sendmail 8.6.x's userdb facility. Our mail configuration accomodates
this well. But PINE insists on slapping a constant string on the end of
the username.

The solution I've used for both problems is the same: supress the
generation of the Message-ID: and From: headers in outgoing mail & news.

Why doesn't PINE work that way in the first place? It doesn't make sense
for the MUA to compute the correct values of those headers. It makes many
MUAs to configure when we could get away with only configuring the MDA.
Not to mention complex configurations supported by sendmail but not
some or all MUAs!

My 2 cents...

If anyone is interested in my patches to pine-3.91 to supress these
headers (including the implementation of posting via inews since it was
previously unimplemented), mail me.

  And Microsoft wants to own the Internet?  Scary.  I'm looking
  gleefully forward to the day that their "Network" dies a
  well-deserved death.

  How can a company that spews out so much brain-damaged software be
  so successful?  Guess cause dopes like us buy it.

  Just say NO to Microsoft.

Maybe I missed something entirely obvious ... but
how do you attach an 8 bit file to a Pine message?

Use vi or some other simple find and replace text tool and replace all of 
the ":" with "!" in your .newsrc. That should unsubscribe you to everything.
I'm not sure what happens if you have a truncated or shortened .newsrc 
like you describe. If this doesn't work, copy one of your friend's over 
to your account and then do the find and replace again.

	Enable the news-approximates-new-status option in Setup/Config. If
this is enabled, pine assumes that all news articles before the last one
that you deleted have already been read. So, all you have to do is delete
the last message that you read (doesn't actually delete --- just marks it
as deleted) and when you return to read news the next day, it will start
at the first article that you haven't read. I haven't bothered to confirm
this, but I think that if you delete the very last article in a newsgroup,
it doesn't work. I usually delete the second to the last article and make
sure that the last article is unread.

    I have encountered a similar problem with Pine 3.91 on a Unix 
system.  Although I know what's going on, it is irritating nonetheless.  
I usually start Pine with the -l parameter so that my folder collections 
for mail and news are already setup.  (My personal style is that I often 
flip back and forth between them.)

    Now, the news server on the system I use often seems to be a bit 
flaky, going up and down several times a session when things are bad.  If 
it goes down behind the curtains (i.e., unknown to me) and I try to flip 
folder collections, Pine seems as if it is hung, when in fact it is 
futilely trying to bang on the news server's door, but the news server 
is unconscious.  This brings everything to a screeching halt until 
something or other finally times out and Pine finally gives up with an 
error message and at least lets me use the local folder collection.

    I don't know whether the timeout interval can be set, but it is 
exasperatingly long.  Sometimes the screen blanker on my PC has even 
kicked in.

Quite likely in fact, but why should Pine need to contact the nameserver 
in order to start up.  All it should have to do is read in pine-conf 
files and a user's Inbox.  If the reason why Pine needs to contact the 
nameserver is to determine our hostname and domain name, is there a way 
that I can hardcode our hostname so that in future outages and when there 
are lags at our nameserver Pine will start up immediately?
Thanks

Actually, the thing that annoys me more than quotes that are longer than 
the new text is those people who reply immediately, and then leave the 
entire message, including the sig, in tact at the end.  I get the 
impression that my responder has much more to say than he/she really 
does, and what probably happened is that there was no real intention to 
make any quotations.  Pine gives a prompt for both mail and news 
concerning "include original message ... "  It shouldn't be that hard to 
just say no if you are sure the recipient will remember his/her own subject.

Has anyone out there taken the source code for Pine and translated the

Is there a way on 3.91 to highlight text with either "bold" or 
"underline" formats?  This is probably tricky since every terminal (dumb) 
probably uses different control characters for this feature.  I am 
looking for this on VTxxx environments.

If not on 3.91, are there plans for this?

Thanks,

Abraham

Well, the thing that annoys me are discussions that seem to have
nothing to do with the chosen group.
 
Do you have some proposal for a modification to Pine to avoid the
misbehaviour that you describe?  Apparently you do not.

Hello,
	I login in Unix and read mail by pine and saved the mail in the 
folders. Is that posssible to read the folders in PC like reading it in 
pine. I heard there is something called PC-pine. Is the purpose of the 
PC-pine can provide the facilities that I requested?
	'coz this is convenience for me to read the one folder containing 
many mail at home.
	I mean d/l the folder back home from the Unix, and read the

If you flag all read messages as unread, is it O. K.? (via enebling flag=20
command and select command in Setup/Config menu; then selecting (`;') all=
=20
read messages (or simly alll messages), then Apply (`A') a Flag command=20
(`F') a set a New (unread) mail for all selected messages)

Hope this helps

The PINE documentation implies that an alternative spell-checking 
programme can be run in PINE.  Unfortunately I cannot find any references 
to how this may he done and the system configuration files suggest that 
the only one available is that attached to PICO.

Can anyone tell me:

a. How can another spell-checker be configured to run under PINE?

b. Which spell checkers are compatible with PINE run under a FreeBSD Unix 
system?

Please reply by e-mail.  Thank you.

In the header area, press ^J (ctrl-j), which will ask you for a file to 
attach and a comment to go along with the file.  Your attached file will 
be MIMEd and sent.  
Does your recipient use Pine or another MTA with MIME compatibility?

If not, your recipient will need mpack/munpack to decode your 
attachment or you will have to uuencode your binary file and read it into 
your message with ^R.

Eudora (as far as I know) only downloads "new" messages.  If you are using
the latest Pine (3.91) you can type ;aa*n  (Select all, apply mark new)
You should do that while in your inbox. 
That's the bad way.  The better way is to open pine in read-only mode!
That would be: pine -o

Here's a simple solution:

Save this script as ckspell.
- ---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<--- CUT HERE ---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---
#!/bin/csh -f
#set QUOTECHAR = "| "
#set ALTEDITOR = "pico -z -n -t"
set ALTSPELL = "ispell -x"
#
# Replace Pine's quote characters if QUOTECHAR is set.
#
if( ${?QUOTECHAR} ) then
	cp $1 $1.$$
	sed s/^"> "/"$QUOTECHAR"/g < $1.$$ > $1
	rm $1.$$
endif
#
# Use an alternate editor if ALTEDITOR is set.
#
if( ${?ALTEDITOR} ) then
	$ALTEDITOR $1
endif
#
# Run the alternate spell checker if ALTSPELL is set.
#
if( ${?ALTSPELL} ) then
	$ALTSPELL $1
endif
#
- ---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<--- CUT HERE ---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---

Put ckspell in a directory for executables and run the command:
	chmod 700 ckspell ; rehash

Point Pine's alternate editor at ckspell.  Hit <control> _ when you want to
run the spell checker.  Uncomment the "set ALTSPELL" and check the 
"enable-alternate-editor-implicitly" feature for a little tighter
integration.

| b. Which spell checkers are compatible with PINE run under a FreeBSD Unix 
| system?

Anything you want.

| 
| Please reply by e-mail.  Thank you.
| 

I haven't actually tested the script, so let me know if it barfs.

Is it possible to enter French characters into pine messages? We are 
using unix Pine/Pico with PCs acting as vt100 terminals. When in vi I can 
hold down the alt key and type 135 (on the numeric keypad) and the letter 
c with a squiggle under it appears on the screen. If I do the same in 
Pico the Illegal command message appears.

Is there something I am missing? How can you get any of the extended 
ASCII characters into a document.

Note: I can edit messages in Pico which contain these extended characters 
with no problems. I just can't enter these characters into the editor.

	I have trouble with the ctrl-^ command whenever I log into my
Unix account from a Mac and use pine.  I don't try to figure out what's
wrong any more...what's wrong with Mac's can't be fixed by me.  I don't 
know if this helps explain your problem or not...simply put, it could be a
terminal emulation problem

As you all know the problem has been solved.

Several people asked if I can reproduce what happenned, and I can.  If I 
delete my .newsrc file, then start up tin, it recreates an .newsrc file.  
All newsgroups are originally unsubcribed to.  Once I exit and restart 
tin, however, all groups are once again subscribed.  By the way it 
doesn't seem to matter if I pick certain groups to subscribe to, it still 
subscribes me to all newsgroups.

Once again, thanks for all the help.  I don't read this newsgroup 
regularly so if you have anymore questions about what happenned please 
email again.

How does this work?  I type ctrl-^, and nothing happens.  I then press 
another key and a "[B" appears, the same as if I'd typed it in.  Then if 
I type ctrl-K it only erases the line I'm currently on.  What am I doing

On my system, it suffices to do say "touch .vacation.msg". Another
"vacation -I" will start the vacation message again.

I am using Pine Version 3.90 on an Ultrix 4.3.0 workstation. When 
composing a message, I would like to include a Reply-To field by default, 
which I know how to do. However, I would prefer that the Reply-To field
is not the first, i.e. top header in the header list but that the To: 
field were instead. This is to stop myself putting the target email 
address in the Reply-To field since I am used to typing the address 
without having to go down a field first. i.e. Is there a way to change
the default order of the fields in the header list when composing a message?
 
Thanks

Maybe that will work in your case.

Hi,

Does anyone know if/how I can get pine to notify me
when a news arrives in a group I susbscribe to (as it does when

Thanks for any help,

I posted on the same subject some time ago, but didn't
receive any feedback.

Being stubborn, I'll try again.

When I try to send a mail using PINE, I get the error message:

   No valid author specification present

The mail I'm sending ends up in my sent-mail folder, but nowhere
else.

I've experienced the same problem with ELM, but the solution there
is a definition DONT-ADD-FROM (or something like it) that has to
be disabled when compiling and linking.

I'm using MMDF under SCO UNIX 3.2v4.2 (hope to upgrade to 5.0 soon),
and I understand that MMDF might have something to do with this.

As it is extremely annoying to only be able to use half of PINE,
can someone out there please take the time to guide me in the right
direction.

Any help is much appreciated.

The same thing was the case with the new -F option to fix the 'From' line.
When I talked to them about 2 years ago, the insisted that would NEVER fix
it since they considered it to be correct.  Guess enough people complained
and they finally broke down.

Also, the SMTP gateway is far more reliable if you use the latest
sendmail..

I am having a problem with PINE and Telix. Whenever I use the "Y" option to

overprinting and printing garbage. The system then locks up with the
"printing message" message. I am using Telix 3.22 and have been told that it
is incompatible with the PINE print function. Is their a fix? Tech support
hasn't been forthcoming with solutions.

Only my guess, you're hitting ctrl+6 not ctrl+^ (which is ctrl+shift+6)?

    I think I understand what you are getting at.  With the exception of 
the INBOX that actually reads the system spool, the folders Pine reads 
and manipulates are simply files.  (I use Unix Pine 3.91.)  Provided you 
have read acces to the files/folders -- and if you didn't Pine couldn't 
at least show them in read-only mode -- then you can download them to 
your PC with whatever file transfer protocol you have available to work 
with (Zmodem, Xmodem, Kermit, etc.).

    Just back out of Pine and locate the directory where Pine keeps the
folders.  Most likely it will be a subdirectory of your home directory,
quite probably called "mail."  The individual folders will be in files of
the same name.  Just download the one you want to your PC and read it with
your favorite editor or file viewer.  This works on a local collection of
folders other than the INBOX proper and is only a reading technique.

    If you can successfully generate what you want in vi, try composing
your message with vi.  Then, when you are in the composer, just read in
the file composed with vi using the Pine ^R command.  Better yet, you can
tell Pine in the configuration that you want to use vi as your editor when
composing messages rather than using Pine's built-in composer.  I can't
guarantee that either of these methods would work, as I haven't had reason
to try them, but they are simple to try out and worth a shot.

I try to send an e-mail message, I get the following error message that 
appears briefly at the bottom of my screen:

"/usr write failed: file system is full"

When this happens, a copy of the e-mail message is copied to my 
"sent-mail" folder but, the e-mail message is not actually sent. I tried 
sending a few test notes to myself and did not receive them.

Also, I recently noticed several pine debug files in my home directory. I 
don't know if these are related to my problem or not.

Can anyone please tell me what the error message means? What is "usr" and 
which file system does it mean is full?

Please e-mail reply if possible.

Thank you,

Willie Sullivan <willie@tyrell.net>

That sounds fine to me.
 
But, it would be polite to check first with your recipients to make
sure that they can actually read the messages!
 
Even if they use PINE (and there are some people out there that
don't), it is not guaranteed that they have a terminal that
displays (or is correctly set up to display) characters in the
upper half of the 8-bit code table.
 
As the saying goes - "be pessimistic in what you send out, and
generous in interpreting what you receive".

Do you know why the remote shell hangs from your Linux system and not from
the BSD system?  Is your IP service provider deliberately filtering out
rsh packets in a misguided effort to provide you with "security"?

You can work around it by specifying the IP port number in the folder
specification, e.g. {server:143}inbox instead of {server}inbox, but it's
better for you to find out why the underlying problem is happening.

You should either get a remote preauthenticated IMAP server, or an
immediate error with the command:
	rsh server /etc/rimapd
If you aren't, something is wrong with the way your system is set up.

Pehaps someone will know what I can do about this. 

I have saved messages in a number of folders.

When I look at an old message in one of these folders, and then use the
"L" option to return to, say, the Inbox folder, PINE will often, but not
always, ask me if I wish to expunge the deleted message in the folder I 
just looked at.  BUT I DIDN'T delete anything there!

That is what I think is the bug.

Of course, I can always hit the "N", but since the default response to the 
"expunge" question is "YES", I always risk losing such a message if I'm 
moving fast.

I have recently installed PINE on a U6000/550 from Unisys and am having a 
MINOR problem:  How can I filter the headers on an incoming message so 
that all the Received-From and X-.... headers do not show?  I have PINE 
on a LYNIX box and it only shows the Date, To, From, and Subject 
headers.  Is this a pine configuration option, a compile option, or a 
SENDMAIL option?  I need to resolve this before I am called in to train 
the University President and his V.P.'s

Thanks!

Pine uses a gethostbyname() call to get the FQDN from the official name
return value in the returned hostent structure.  If gethostbyname() does
not do so on your system, it is because your system is misconfigured.
99.9% of the time, it is because you have an /etc/hosts entry for your
local machine which looks like:
	10.20.30.40	blurdybloop blurdybloop.foo.com
when the correct entry is
	10.20.30.40	blurdybloop.foo.com blurdybloop

The first name in /etc/hosts is the official name; all other names are
nicknames.  It is not good to have the FQDN as a nickname instead of the
official name.

This makes a big -- and misguided -- assumption.  You are assuming that
the MTA will do the fixup.  This is not true on many systems.  Nor is it
really the proper the role of the MTA to generate MUA fields.

For every system in which sendmail has been carefully crafted to override
the MUAs to do exactly what the system manager wants, there are hundreds
in which sendmail's configuration is straight out of the box.  We have to
make Pine do the right thing for the majority of systems.

Another reason is that the Message ID's identify the generating program
and its version.  This is sometimes useful for us in dealing with bug
reports.  Separate headers often get filtered by gateways.

Set on the signature-at-bottom option in Set-up/Config menu (i. e. go to
the main menu, then to press S, then C, then move a cursor at line with
text mentioned above and press X. Then press E. It should work now, if=20
not. try quit pine and start it again.

Hope this helps

Pine will not show the extra headers unless you turn on the
enable-full-header-cmd feature in your .pinerc file (or
/usr/local/lib/pine.conf) and give the 'h' command.  Giving 'h' again will
toggle the full header mode back off...

Nicole, i think pine will tell you that you have mail unless you move 
your read messages out of the inbox, like saved messages.

I would appreciate very much if anyone can make it clear.
In IMAP4 (RFC 1730), if a client send a literal empty string {0}
to an IMAP4 server, the server should response with a command
continuation request response with the token "+". (See Page 6 and
38 in the RFC)
And then what the IMAP4 server expects next? Is it a new command? 
Or is it still the rest of the previous command?

Thanks in advance,

	I can back up a folder by exporting each message to a file in my 
home directory, appending each to the previous, and then ftp'ing that 
from here (my pine account's on a machine in the bowels of the building 
somewhere) onto a diskette -- but the process is tedious, and the result 
messy. Is there a good way to transfer a whole folder intact onto a 
diskette, off that other machine, onto a diskette stuffed into the 
workstation I sit at? LaMail, which comes bundled with the OS/2 package 
(at least the one we have here), is pretty flaky, but it does transfer 
whole folders onto diskette without supervision, in the background, while 
I get something else done; surely pine can do better??

Hello, I have sent a few ascii files as attachments to mail and they 
arrive in MIME format. Is there anyway to disable this. The receiveding 
end does not have MIME capability. I will be sending them Mpack and 
Munpack but what to do in the meantime? Any way to disable MIME in Pine?

Thanx,

Al

The folder is just an ascii text file, usually stored in the subdirectory 
'mail' under your home directory.  Just transfer that file to diskette in 
the same way you were transfering the file you were exporting to.

  e.g., copy mail/<foldername> a:     if attached to your file server.

This has nothing to do with Pine.

I am trying to build pine 3.91 on Solaris 2.4.  The first problem
encountered was that the build command told me to look at a doc file
which didn't exist in the tar file that was on ftp.cac.washington.edu.
Then I peeked in the pine directory, saw makefile.sol, and thus tried
a build sol.  I immediately was concerned when I saw that build was
trying to configure pine as if being compiled on a machine without
an ANSI C compiler when my compiler is ANSI C, but unfortunately I havent
figured out yet what to change to fix that.   Are there other
things with which I should be concerned during the process?  For
instance, the makefile says that it is :
Making c-client library, mtest and imapd
and of course I don't see pine and pico listed there :-( ...

I appreciate the thought, but I have already tried that.  The problem I 
have is a little more subtle than that.  I have had Pine running on a 
lynix box for some time now and the ONLY headers a user sees (with a 
plain vanilla .pinerc file) are the DATE, TO, FROM, and SUBJECT.  My 
Director wishes to see only those headers on all mail.  By this I mean 
that he want me to filter the Reply-to, Received, and all Comment type 
headers.  All he wants is to see those four headers and no others, even 
if they were attached by previous mailers.  I think I will have to look 
at the way that Pine processes the header and delete every line except 
those four and find some way to turn the whole thing on and off so that I 
will still have the headers for debugging.

The headers that I am talking about are present if you use mailx, also.

I notice the same behavior on my system using pine-3.91.  I believe
that Pine doesn't automatically refresh its inbox except at set
time intervals.  You can force the refresh by using the "Next"
command when you are at the last message in the inbox folder index.
You can also use the "^L" command at other points (don't remember
exactly where).  The help system gives more info.

The delete (ascii character DEL, octal 0177, syn control-question mark 
^?) character and the backspace (ascii character BS, octal 010, syn 
control-H ^H) are synonymous in Pico and both do the same things.

The reason that these characters both do the same thing in Pico/Pine is 
that there is no general agreement on keyboard placement, on whether the 
key in the upper-right corner of the keybord should be a backspace key or 
a delete key.  PCs have a backspace key there.  Macs have a delete key 
there.  Unix workstations gallop off in every direction depending on 
vendor, and even (like Hewlett-Packard) by keyboard model.

Usually redefining one's keyboard is a hairy matter, so since backing up 
is a much more common thing to do than deleting forward, the prudent 
course of action is to make both keys do the same thing.  In Pico, you 
can press control-D to delete forward.

For my users, I have just unilaterally decided to set them up initially 
to use DEL (mainly because that's what Emacs wants).  For some other 
sites, the opposite may be true.  I think if you have a heterogeneous 
environment, the decision must be made one way or the other, because 
otherwise you're going to have lots of strange differences between 
different platforms.  In a homogeneous environment, you can just go 
whichever way your vendor went.

(It's unfortunate that both the first and second obvious choices for 
getting help -- control-H and control-? -- are the backspace and delete 
keys.  Programs like Emacs just assume you're going to use control-? for 
backspacing and control-H for help.  Nothing's ever easy these days...)

Let me rephrase... how do I go about setting up pine so that all new 
users use the same global addressbook?  I'd rather not have to tell the 
user how to go into setup/config and manually change the location of the 
global addressbook.

Simply include the file in the body of message.  Don't use the
attachment facility.

After some experimentation I found that although pine will use any
specified 'user-domain' when forming the reply address, it will still
use the local host name for the message-id, and apparently does not 
check to make sure that the part after the '@' is a fully-qualified
domain name.  It *could* append the 'user-domain' after the host name
if the host name does not contain a dot, but does not do so.  The basic
problem is that the MTA is not being given an opportunity to do the
things it knows most about, such as setting the correct reply address
and message-id.  The MUA is trying to do the MTA's job.

A similar design flaw exists in the MH mail system, though it's not as
acute, becaue MH tries to form the reply address but not the
message-id.

What saves the user is that in almost all cases, syntactically-invalid
message-ids will be accepted by receiving software.  I don't believe I
have ever observed email to be bounced or dropped because of an invalid
message-id.  The only likely exception is that if a mail-to-News
gateway preserves the message-id, the gatewayed posting will likely be
dropped by inn sites, unless the gateway takes steps to correct the
syntax in the message-id or generate a new one.  Fortunately most such
gateways just replace the old message-id with a new valid one.

This issue is something to think about, but not worth losing sleep
over.

Is there a way to configure PC-PINE to access this global address book

Ok, I checked and this is what I added to the Setup/Configuration:

I am using Pine 3.91 and BSDI v2.0

I want to avoid the following:
	1. users logging into the mail server.
	2. entering users into the new machine
	3. letting the users know the machine is there.

If the mailing address shows up in the To or Cc header, you can use
procmail's ^TO to catch it.  Lots of details are in my Filtering Mail
FAQ, which is accessible from:

As far as I know, the only two requirements for message id fields
are that:
1. They are unique.
2. To the right of the @-sign, there must be some text that should *look*
   like a domain name.

If Pine chooses to append just the hostname and not the FQDN, then
there is nothing wrong with the generated msgid, as long as (in its
entirity) it is unique (in time and space).
In fact, it doesn't even have to append the hostname, it could append
just any name, as long as it looks like a domain name and as long as
the entire msgid is unique.

Subject: Split Mail Messages



We have just recently moved our campus email server (called mcmail) from
an SGI platform to a SUN 1000 O/S version 2.4. We are running version
8.6.9 of sendmail with PINE 3.89 .

We have come across an oddity. A colleague on the same system saved
approximately 6 of his email messages to a folder and then emailed the
folder to me as an attachment to an email message. I saved the attachment
as a file and then composed a message to myself and read in the file (^R)
.  I then mailed the message.  My message to myself arrived blank and then
all the email messages that had been included in the message arrived right
after it as separate messages in my INBOX. None of the included messages
had been addressed to me but I received them all as separate mail
messages. 

Is this a bug or does a parameter or something need changing? 

Thanks for any information you can give me.
Carolynn

Hi,

I'm running 3.91 on a Sun SPARC. I have nntp-server set in 
/usr/local/lib/pine.conf, and I was wondering if it is possible to unset 
nntp-server for a single user while leaving the global pine.conf 
unchanged, so that News-Collections doesn't appear for that user only. 

TIA,

I'm no expert, but it appears that, since you included your folder as 
part of your message body, that data appears in the INBOX as if it were 
individual messages.  If you had read the data in with an offset or a 
preceding character (e.g., '>'), Pine would have not interpreted the 
header data as comprising individual message headers.

The reason it went okay as a MIME'd attachment is that the headers don't 
look like headers.

Hope that explains it.

And possible choices for viewing the folders on your PC are PC-Pine
for DOS and PS-Pine for Windows, which are available from:

  ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/pcpine

I think that in order to use these to view a folder on your PC you
need to be connected to the Net - does anyone know if that's true?

Thanks,
Nancy

	I am in the process of installing Pine 3.91.  We have had Pine 3.88
for a while so I am familiar with pine and pico which are created in the
installation process.  Also created are imapd and mtest with which I am not
familiar.  I know what imap means and does but the documentation that comes
with Pine 3.91 is not very specific as what to do with imapd and mtest
unless I missed it.  I suspect that imapd is the daemon that accepts imap
connections but how is it activated?  Do I need to install additional
software or is it all included in pine?  Some daemons are activated by simply
typing the name but that does not seem to work here.  Can anyone enlighten
me about how to use imapd and mtest or point me to the place where I might
find that information?

OK, here we go again.  I am under a deadline to open up a PINE mail 
server to some executive types.  I have been madated that the only 
headers that will appear on ANY email message from anywhere are DATE, TO, 
FROM, and SUBJECT.  I have been informed that this is the standard for 
all email systems (????) and that I must comply.  I have a lynix system 
that is running PINE 3.89 that shows only the four headers mentioned.  Is 
this a configuration option that I can turn on and off?  Do I need to 
hack the living daylights out of PINE?  

If you can help, I would appreciate it.  I am running PINE 3.89 on a 
U6000/550 from UNISYS that is a System V Release 4 machine.  I am 
beginning to suspect that my job rides on this one.

If the mailing address shows up in the To or Cc header, you can use
procmail's ^TO to catch it.  Lots of details are in my Filtering Mail
FAQ, which is accessible from:

Good luck,

Hi!

I know, that elm has an autoreply-feature. We all know, that pine is the

Gerry,
I think the reason you haven't had much response to your inquiry is
that we're all confused by your request (at least I am).  Pine's normal
behavior is to display exactly and only the four headers you seem to want
displayed, and what you apparently *do* see displayed on your "Lynix"
(sic) system.  As David indicated, you really have to work to get Pine to
display *full* headers...

So what *exactly* are you seeing on the Unisys system?
Does the Full Headers toggle not work?  What happens when you use the H cmd?
Can you capture a screen to illustrate the problem?
Are you sure somebody didn't stick an "H" in your initial-keystroke-list?

I assume that the requirement is that only the above four headers be
displayed to Pine users --not that someone thinks they should never be
generated, lest they annoy someone who is not using Pine.  I also assume
that we are talking about the headers of the currently displayed message,
not any message headers that might have been included by the sender as
part of the message text...

Ok, here we go again.  The headers that are giving problems are in the 
message that I have included below.  I am seeing with pine all the 
normal internet messages such as Received: from blah by someone (junk, 
junk, junk, junk...)
and things like Message-Id and so on.

These are normal on all email systems I have used on the internet such 
as RICE mail or Bitnote and so on.  I strongly suspect that PINE is not 
generating any of these but instead is unable to supress them in my case.

I am going to bcc this to another account to be sure that what is sent 
out is what I suspect.  Hope this helps as I am in a REAL bind.

PS.  I think it is a simple UNIX problem and not PINE per se.  I am a 
simple mind as far as UNIX is concerned, but either not smart enough or 
not stupid enough to see how to fix this.

By the way, the H toggle does suppress or show one or two headers but 
does not significantly change the situation.

Gerry,
The headers in question are indeed a normal part of all Internet mail
messages... the only issue is whether they get displayed when you view
the message.

So I claim I never see these headers in Pine unless:
 o I turn on Full Header mode, or
 o Someone sends me a message with such headers included.

You claim you *always* see them in Pine on Unisys, but that you *never*
see them in Pine on Linux.

So where do we go from here?  The Pine display code is identical for both
versions.

I wonder if it is possible that the mail delivery agent on the Unisys
machine is adding an errant newline to messages, so that some of the
headers are being treated as part of the message body.  That might also
explain why toggling H only showed a couple of more lines.

I agree that the mailer on the Unisys may be including an errant line.  
There was an earlier problem like that with POP3 clients.  Any ideas?  I 
strongly suspect a blank line BEFORE the actual header (may be just a 
NEWLINE) is the problem.

The question is: Who do I hang? 

Unless my wits have deserted me completly, isn't the first blank line, or 
single newline character, the definition of the end of the header and 
beginning of the body?  If so, I am going to rattle some cages at UNISYS!

    There should be plenty of people on the procmail mailing list who 
can help you with procmail questions.  I follow it and have picked up 
good information there.  To subscribe, send a one-line message to:

As the manager of a gateway, I have had to include code to massage
message id's received from mail into ones acceptable to news. Mostly 
removing spaces, but also removing illegal characters.

There is also a limitation on what characters they may contain.

There are two parts of the message id for a reason. There is the local
side, which a system CAN guarantee is unique locally but cannot
guarantee globally, and the FQDN, which can be guaranteed globally
unique but is not locally unique. Together, the whole is guaranteed
globally unique.

There is no guarantee of uniqueness if the host uses only its local
hostname. There are many sites named "skyking" for example, but only
one "skyking.oce.orst.edu". If both used just "skyking", and both used
the same algorithm for message id's (not uncommon, if they both run the
same news code), they can generate the same message id. Unlikely, but
the RFC doesn't say "probably unique".
