hello everyone!
Just switched from elm to pine because of its mime capabilities I encountered
a problem with netscape. I configured netscape to use the pine mailcaps file
but netscape geves me the following error message:
Ignoring unsupported format code in mailcap file: %{

and this five times. Has anyone a solution?

Best regards

Andreas

Hello:

I am posting this message on behalf of a friend.  Please reply directly
to him at s832816@aix2.uottawa.ca (the default if you "reply" to this
message).

He was wondering if there was any way to request receipt notification
and/or read notification when sending a mail message using Pine.  I have
looked on my Pine but wasn't able to figure out how to do so (it doesn't
seem to be in the rich headers).

Any information would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

Don't you hate when that happens?  The first time that happened to me I 
had to kill the process.  I have since figured out how to get back in.
When you type ctrl-Z it prints a message telling you how to get back in.
Stopped. Type 'fg' to restart PINE.  Try it and see if it works for you

Is there an Timeout interval set for IMAP?

If you are trying to retrieve mail from another system via IMAP, and if
the system is either down or network not responding then you are hosed.
Pine will keep on trying to make an IMAP connection and goes into an
endless loop. Shouldn't 1 min. or so be set as Timeout period for this?

Hello,

is there anybody who knows about the possibility of automatic
mail bouncing, may be triggered by a special dot-file.

an example should explain what I mean:

if someone is on vacation and leaves his machine running, the mailer
should be able to send the mails back to the sender with a short reply why 
the mail was sent back. I know that this is possible on sgi's, but I 
don't know how to enable this behaviour. 

So while I'm writing, I am not very shure, if this question belongs realy
into the pine group. But perhaps somebody of you know an answer.
thanks

btw: I'm working on a Linux box...

You can do it in your .pinerc by changing the personal-name= field to 
whatever name you wish to use.

On many systems, you can change it by using the `chfn' command.  
This will change your full name in /etc/passwd, in your finger
info, and in lots of apps, including Pine.

I'm having a major problem.  I'm trying to install PcPine version 3.91 
for DOS and with a SLIP connection to an internet provider which is 
called Cris (concentric research information service).  The problem 
exists when I go to specify my inbox path.  Cris uses a pop3 mail server, 
so I specify my path like this:  {pop3.cris.com}inbox.  When I do this, 
the system comes back and says Host not found.  I know the domain name 
server is specified and works properly, because I have no problem with 
any of my other slip programs.  At the end of this post, I will include 
the text in my wattcp.cfg file so whoever reads this can confirm that I'm 
set up properly.  Is there a difference between a pop3 and imap server?  
If so, what do I need to do to set up pine since I don't know the imap 
address or if we have one for that matter?  Anyone's help would be welcome.
Thanks in advance

   If you can't do the above (as it happens to me because I run pine
   in a separate window with no shell in it), or anyhow, you can
   do the following from another window :

     kill -CONT pinepid

   where you get pinepid from ps. This sends a "continue" signal and
   is equivalent to the "fg" command (also is not confused by other
   jobs running if any)

Does anyone know of a way to add PGP as a feature to Pine so you don't
have to edit your email off line then reading them into Pine?  I looked
through the pinerc file and the on-line docs and didn't find any help.

This is a great idea.  I agree with the poster who suggested that you
include other protocols such as IMSP, X.500, Kerberos, and NNTP.  Here's
some info about PC Pine for DOS, Windows, and Unix.  I'm also sending
this to comp.mail.pine so folks over there can add other Pine info.
It would be great if you put this on the net somewhere (http or ftp)
so I can add it to my Web pages.

I like to compose some messages ofline and then do an ASCII upload of

together.  Is there any way I can stop it from doing this?  It takes a 
lot of time to go in and separate my paragraphs and it shouldn't be 
necessary.

Also is there a way to tell Pine that the delete key is not the same as 
the backspace key.  In all my other programs the delete key deletes the 
character under the cursor.  In Pine (and Pico) it does the same thing as 
the backspace key and I keep deleting the wrong character.

I don't know the DOS/Windows versions, but, Unix version of pine
already supports POP3 although 3.91 distribution has a bug there
which renders it useless. I think, you have to take the last IMAP
distribution from pine.cac.washington.edu and replace the one that
comes with the pine distribution with it.

How does one get an attached file to one's own computer?

Having Reply-To: be the same as From: is hardly superfluous or
unusual, but I haven't had any problem doing it, either.  Is the
comparison case-sensitive?  I capitalize my site name in my
reply-to:, so maybe that confuses the checking routine and lets
me put the header the way it belongs?

Now if only I could get a Return-Receipt-To: header to show up in
my default headers, with no value, so that I could add one when I
wanted to see where some peice of mail is going astray!

Is there a good way to get pine to let me sometimes add a

the time, so I can't put it in as a customized header.  If I put
it on my standard headers list, with no value set, it doesn't
show up to be edited.  How can I simply edit the headers
directly, like I can in elm or nn or most other apps I use?

Status: O
X-Status: 

I'm a long-time news and email user recently forced to use pine
on one site instead of more traditional mailers like Mail and
elm.  Some of pine's idiosyncacracies are really getting on my
nerves.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

In every standard mail application I've ever used, forwarding a
piece of mail gives me the original mail as included text, with
my .signature on the bottom, where it belongs.  News readers
mostly work the same way, too.  With pine, I can't figure out how
to do this: it keeps wanting to put my .signature *before* the
forwarded text, which is obviously wrong and can occasionally
cause problems, e.g. when my sig-dashes trigger a long-.sig
filter and most of the message is cut off as being an
excessively-long .signature file.

Is it possible to configure pine to forward mail normally?

While I'm at it, is it possible to have pine insert my sig-dashes
so I don't have to have one .sig file for pine and another one
for the rest of the applications in the world?  (Other apps have
this as a configurable option, but the defualt is usually for the
mailer/newsreader to insert the dashes above the contents of the
.signature file.  Now I have to have a .signature for normal apps
and a .sig-with-dashes for pine.)

Subject: Compiling 3.91 under Solaris 2.4

There've been a couple of request about how to compile pine 3.91 under
Solaris 2.4.  I just tried it, since I'm upgrading a SPARC II from
SunOS 4.1.1B (yes, you read that right).

I didn't use gcc, I used Sun's compiler.  Given that, only minor changes
are necessary to make the distribution compile:

In the pine directory, add -DANSI to CFLAGS in makefile.sol:

*** makefile.sol.orig	Wed Oct  5 01:14:50 1994
--- makefile.sol	Mon Jul  3 02:17:06 1995
***************
*** 70,74 ****
  
  # Use these for the Solaris C compiler
! CFLAGS= -DSV4 $(OPTIMIZE) $(PROFILE) $(DEBUG) -DSYSTYPE=\"SOL\"
  # LDCC= /usr/bin/cc
  # If you don't have /usr/bin/cc (our Solaris 2.2 doesn't seem to have it,
--- 70,74 ----
  
  # Use these for the Solaris C compiler

  # LDCC= /usr/bin/cc
  # If you don't have /usr/bin/cc (our Solaris 2.2 doesn't seem to have it,

In pine/osdep, diddle a couple #defines in os-sv4.h:

*** os-sv4.h.orig	Mon Oct 10 17:30:01 1994
--- os-sv4.h	Mon Jul  3 02:22:18 1995
***************
*** 186,192 ****
  
  /*----------------- Are we ANSI? ---------------------------------------*/
! /* #define ANSI          /* this is an ANSI compiler */
  
! #define	const		/* compiler doesn't support const */
  
  /*------ If our compiler doesn't understand type void ------------------*/
--- 186,192 ----
  
  /*----------------- Are we ANSI? ---------------------------------------*/
! #define ANSI          /* this is an ANSI compiler */
  
! /* #define	const		/* compiler doesn't support const */
  
  /*------ If our compiler doesn't understand type void ------------------*/


I still got a zillion compiler warnings, but "build sol" at least generated
runnable executables, and they seem to work.  (pico and pine, at least,
I didn't try anything else.)

Hope this helps someone.

She can ask her Postmaster to add

Her Postmaster can put this alias to include addresses from file

(I'm assuming that her Postmaster knows hwat to do.)

I'm using 3.91, and checking the signature-at-bottom option does
not put my .signature below forwarded mail.  The .signature still
appears before the forwarded mail.

Does anyone have any other suggestions?  

Does anyone know why pine defaults to this odd configuration in
the first place, instead of putting my .signature at the bottom
of my mail?

An emailed response gives me one workaround: pine will format the
forwarded mail properly if I use Reply then change the To: header
after I'm done editing the message.  Not elegant, but at least it
works.

Still hoping this is a configurable option.....

    In this case, what is "normal" is a matter of interpretation, as Pine 
allows you to do it both ways.  From the Main Menu, go into Setup and 
then Config.  Scroll down some, and check the box "signature-at-bottom."

    This I doubt.  I, for one, would not want it.

    As a general remark, I doubt that Pine is all things to all people, 
or even intended to be.  It suits my needs just fine, particularly 
because it does have a fairly generous selection of "power user" features 
(such as using a different editor) which one may turn on or off at will.  
I've been using Pine 3.91 under Unix daily for about six months now, and 
every now and then I still discover a new capability.  When I first 
started using it, I thought it was kind of boneheaded, but I have found 
I can do a lot more with it than I originally thought, epsecially because 
there are some interfaces one can exploit, particularly under Unix.

    Have you tried actually putting in a customized header 
(Return-Receipt-To:) with no value?  I haven't needed to do so myself, 
but I would think it should work, at least in Pine 3.91.  Normally, if 
there is no value assigned to the header, Pine would ignore it for 
outgoing mail and news.  When you want to include it, just go into the 
header, press Ctrl-R for Rich Headers, and put in the address before 
you send.

Try editing your default-composer-hdrs variable.

It would help to know what platform Pine is running on (UNIX? DOS?) and
how you're accessing it (dial-up?), but I'll guess it's on a UNIX box and
you're accessing it by dialing into a shell account. 
 
I do ASCII uploads into Pine fairly often and don't have that problem.  
I suspect it is your telecomm software, not Pine, that is to blame.  Some 
telecomm software ignores lines containing only a CR during an ASCII 
dump.  In some telecomm software this is configurable, so check that 
first.
 
If that doesn't work, the trick is to make your "blank" lines actually
non-blank.  Put a space character or two on each blank line.  This will
still appear to be a blank line to the reader, but your computer will
treat it as a non-blank line.  Most telecomm software will send such
lines unmodified.  If that doesn't work, then put an unobtrusive character
(like a period) on each "blank" line.

POP3 support (using it as if it was IMAP) is in 3.91, but has known bugs
which make it less than completely useful.  This bug is fixed in the IMAP
3.6 toolkit which is used in 3.92.  This POP3 support is not turned on for
DOS.

For 3.92 (not yet released), and for 3.91 if you substitute the IMAP 3.6
toolkit, the matrix is:

                   POP2        POP3       IMAP2     IMAP4     MIME
------------------------------------------------------------------
PC Pine for DOS      no         not yet     yes   not yet      yes
PC Pine for Windows  no         not yet     yes   not yet      yes
Unix Pine            no         yes         yes   not yet      yes

Versions after 3.92 are expected to use the IMAP 4.0 toolkit, which has
POP3 code that works on DOS.  For these versions, the matrix will be:

                   POP2        POP3       IMAP2     IMAP4     MIME
------------------------------------------------------------------
PC Pine for DOS      no         yes         yes       yes      yes
PC Pine for Windows  no         yes         yes       yes      yes
Unix Pine            no         yes         yes       yes      yes

I can not speculate at the present time when we will have "native" POP3
support (that is, using POP3 as an offline client rather than as a
dysfunctional IMAP), but this is expected to be sooner rather than later.

It would be fairly simple to add POP2 support, but nobody has asked for it
and the concensus in the POP community is that POP2 is dead.

I have been reported a couple of problems by pine users on AIX 3.2
(we are using several different architectures at this site and this 
looks specific to the AIX version).
I have no core or pine-debug information yet so I would like to understand
whether similar behaviours are already known before investigating further.

Both problems seem to be related with pico, as they happened when composing
a message:
- A pine with no terminal attached (!) was found consuming all available CPU.
  The stack trace was inside pico.
- In another session pico kept pasting the same buffer over and over until
  it was killed by hand. The text was saved into the postponed messages
  folder, and when restarted pine asked whether the user wanted to resume
  composition. After typing "yes" the program crashed.

Anyone ever notice that in PCPine for Windows, you can select messages 
from the index listing with the mouse, but you can't select folders from 
the folder list?  
Also, is there anyway to keep addressbooks and signatures on the UNIX 
host?  Everything else seems to be able to, but not those (this causes 
some headaches for users migrating to PCPine).

Has anyone ever noticed that some email has a blinking Subject line.  
What I want to know is can this be done using pine?  I've used pico to 
edit several files that have blinking subject lines and as of yet can't 
understand how they do it.

Thanks for any help or replies in advance.

I have a feeling that my questions are probably fairly elementary, but I 
would really appreciate any help.

1)  Is it possible to direct mail from a single address (a list, say from
abc@host) into its own folder without it getting into my inbox?

2) Is there a way I can make a batch file to strip all the headers from 
the messages that are in this folder?


Thank you for your help.

    However it's done -- and I am not sure myself -- I would recommend 
against it.  This much I am aware of, "control" bytes are embedded in 
the text of the subject line which are not part of the printable 7-bit 
US-ASCII character set.  On some users' terminals/PCs/whatever, these 
bytes cause the blinking effect.  For other users, they can just cause 
trouble.  Were I one of the latter users, I would be upset.  It may look 
cute -- unless you are one of the recipients whose display goes cuckoo.

Inflicting blinking text on unsuspecting recipients is a cruel and 
unusual punishment.  It is not a practice that should be encouraged.  
Also, the method of doing it is fairly terminal type specific, and what 
works on one can cause problems on another.

Whilst Pine allows you to read and send e-mail and Usenet News messages 
in very similar ways, the underlying delivery mechanisms are quite different.

E-mail arrives at your machine, and gets delivered into a file owned by 
you, and for only you.  Once messages have arrived they remain sitting in 
this file on disk waiting for you to read them and deal with them.

Usenet News is quite a different kettle of fish.  Here articles are 
delivered to a special machine running "news server" software.  They are 
held in a *shared* directory area -- the same area is available to all 
the users, rather then having separate personal copies for each user.

When somebody wants to read news Pine (or whatever other news reader you 
are using) connects to the server and requests a copy of the article to 
display.  This doesn't get saved to a file of your own on disk unless you 
explicitly give a command to do so.

After a time the news server software "expires" old articles, deleting 
them from its shared directory to make room for new material.

So whereas e-mail "comes to you", Usenet News is more of a "you go out 
and get the article you want to read".  This means that whilst e-mail can 
be redirected -- delivered to a different machine/username -- Usenet News 
cannot.

You *might* be able to get around your problem by connecting to your 
"old" news server computer (assuming you are still allowed access after 
your move) to read News from.

Use the header field   Reply-to:  it is designed for this purpose.
Most mail clients take this field instead of the From:, when you issue a 
reply.

"Reply-to:" is not one of the "standard" headers in Pine (the four yet 
normally see when composing a message.

Some additional ones can be seen and used by using the Ctrl/R (Rich
Header) command with the cursor on any of the header lines.  However, 
again "Reply-to:" is not amongst these.

So what you need to do is add it as a "customised header".  You do this 
(in Pine 3.91) by going to the Main Menu then typing S and C to get to the 
Setup Configuration screen.

Next move down to the "customized-hdrs" variable (quite a way down) and 
then type A (Add Value).  Now enter:

	Reply-to: username@blah.blah.blah

and press Return to accept it.  (Obviously "username@blah.blah.blah" 
should really be the e-mail address you want replies to come back to!)

Now leave the Setup Configuration screen by typing E, which will return 
you to the Main Menu.

Now try sending a message.  With the cursor up on a header line type 
Ctrl/R to see all the headers and there should now be an extra one shown 
as "Reply To:" with a default value of your e-mail address already filled 
in (because you included it in the Setup Configuration screen).

Now send the message and try it out!

Note that this header gets added and set up even without having to do a 
Ctrl/R.  You can just Compose a message and send it *without* having to 
do the Ctrl/R -- all this does is *show* you the extra headers (and let 
you change them if you wish).

Thanks for the info Paul.  Now I know why it's not often you see these 
post with blinking subjects.  I myself would be upset also if it locked 
up my system everytime a post of that nature was sent. Just as I've 
always said it pays to ask questions first before you venture out on you 
own.

Thanks again.

DEC Alpha ancient?  Anyway, you didn't give any details.  Is it
running OpenVMS, or Digital Unix?  We have pine running on our system

We've added a (large) global addressbook to our system.  The result is
that pine creates a large (~ 1Mb) file in the /tmp directory (sample
name a3000559) for each user of pine.

Is there a way to have one such file for all users, instead of each
individtual user?  We're wasting lots of space.  The file doesn't
disappear either if a pine is exited abnormally wasting even more

If you go into setup (from the main menu) and then choose "C" for

We have pine running on our Alpha/VMS system.

I think this is because although you have created the "address book" file 
you either haven't created or updated the "lookup" support file.  This 
lives in the same directory as the address book file, and has the same 
name but with ".lu" appended.  (Try looking for .address* in your login 
directory and you'll see what I mean.)

The look up file provides a sort of index into the address book file for 
quick access.

Pine checks the modification times of address book and associated look up 
files as it starts (or soon after, possibly when you start sending a 
message).

If the look up file doesn't exist or is out of date it then tries to 
create/update it automatically.  However if you don't have write access 
to the directory/file, as is usually the case for a global address book, 
it runs into problems.  So instead it makes a temporary version in the 
/tmp directory which it then uses for that session.

The solution is for the maintainer of the global address book to update 
the look up file after any change.  You can do this by logging into a 
username with write access to the directory and file, and then:

	cd to the directory with the address book
	pine -create_lu addrbookname sort-order
	chmod go+r addrbookname.lu

where "sort-order" is one of "dont-sort", "nickname", "fullname", 
"nickname-with-lists-last" or "fullname-with-lists-last" (the same sort 
orders available in the Setup Configuration screen for your personal 
address book).

REMEMBER to reset the protection of the new/modified look up file (the 
"chmod" command above).  I *always* get caught by this; Pine always 
(re)creates it with no access to "group" or "others",  so people can't 
read it, so you *still* get the temporary versions being created in /tmp.

[I'll e-mail the Pine Team separately asking if they can reuse the 
protection of any existing look up file when updating it in some future 
version of Pine.]

    Pine by itself does not do this.  You need mail filtering software 
which preprocesses the mail before Pine gets hold of it.  On Un*x

take up space here, email me if you are on a Un*x system, and I can 
point you to some instructions about procmail.  It's pretty easy to do.  
I am very glad the capability exists.

Yeah, we use PINE & VSIFAX together....  I have had numerous problems
making Pine work, although most of the problems so far have been
system problems, and have mostly been corrected.  What kind of
problems are you having?

We are using an IBM RS/6000 with AIX UNIX 3.2.0.

Hello,

I know that I can compose a letter from the command line using pine then 
the address directly following it, but is there a way that I can use the 
same quick compose method to post to a newsgroup?  My newsgroup header is 
considered part of the customized-headers field and has to be invoked 
using ^R everytime I want to post.  Is there a quicker way?

Understandable, sorry I forgot to mention a change in another file.
Here it goes, hopefully more succesfull. Note that I am using gcc, 2.3.3, and
may have different organisation of include files that you have. Here is what I
did:

0) This works only for pine, a similar problem exist for imapd.

1) Used the build script
      build CC=gcc sol

2) Edited the file pine/makefile.sol around line 80, by adding -DANSI,
   so it looks like this:
   
   # Use these for the gcc compiler
   # Yep, marc
   CC=	gcc
   CFLAGS=	-DSV4 $(OPTIMIZE) $(PROFILE) $(DEBUG) -DSYSTYPE=\"SOL\" -DANSI

3) Changed around line 194 from

BAD:    /*----------------- Are we ANSI?----------------------------------*/
BAD:    /* #define ANSI          /* this is an ANSI compiler */  
BAD:    #define	const		/* compiler doesn't support const */

    to
/*----------------- Are we ANSI? ---------------------------------------*/
/* Changed ma, using gcc which is ansi and understand const */
/* #define ANSI          /* this is an ANSI compiler */

#ifndef ANSI
#define	const		/* compiler doesn't support const */
#endif

   
4) In pine subdirectory
    make -f makefile.sol


If you want to track the error down, then try in the pine directory:

gcc -E -DSV4   -g -DDEBUG -DSYSTYPE=\"SOL\"  -c  addrbook.c | grep "rename(" 

This is the command issued from makefile.sol. The -E option sends the
preprocessor output to stdout, and grep rename searches for defintions of
rename.
Output is:

extern int      rename(const char *, const char *);
extern int rename(  char *,   char *);

I have had pine crash under AIX 3.2.0 when choosing C to compose a new
message, and also when choosing C to continue composing an interrupted
message.  When it crashes, it squirts reversed question marks and
other bizzarre characters onto the terminal, then hangs.  I have to
kill pine from another terminal...

Al,
At the first hint of anyone sending us any cash, I'll be happy to inquire
about tax exemptions!

As for contributing time, there is obviously plenty still to do, but it
can get awkard to manage a software project with too many fingers in the
pie.  The key is to find tasks that can be done relatively independently.
For example, quite a few people have suggested having a mailbox driver
that compresses/uncompresses the folders.  This would be a completely
new and separate c-client driver, so it could be developed without any
coordination with/by the UW team... but so far there have only been
suggestors, no volunteers to implement.

Even if there were volunteers, there are quality control and completeness
issues as well.  Suppose, for example, someone contributed a compressing
folder driver.  But it only worked on Ultrix.  What should we do?  Include
it in the distribution, even though many people would be disappointed
and/or complain that it didn't work on their platform?  Or spend the time
to generalize it?  Or include it as contributed/unsupported?  Probably the
latter, until it became something that the folks who pay our bills cared
about, but my point is that even though there's lots of work to be done,
and *maybe* lots of willing hands, it's not always easy to put the two
together in a way that actually reduces the work for the core team.

Still, on the relatively rare occasions we have received bug fixes or
minor enhancements from folks, we've been very grateful to get them.

That's a likely cause of problems.  I'm not sure about this specific one
offhand, but I would strongly suggest using IMAP rather that NFS to access
remote mailboxes, especially INBOX!

Could you please, tell me how to reach this cyberpunks ftp site at berkeley.

I also need help about compiling pine in SCO UNIX 3.2v4.2, regarding libcrypt.a
Our system doesn't have libcrypt.a. How could we get one ?

Thanks & regards

X-Status: 

I have a couple accounts on one system and I'd like to be able
to access the mail folders in both these accounts using pine
running on one of the accounts.  When the folder is owned
by the userid that's running the pine process, there's no problem.
But if the folder is owned by another userid, pine is not able
to open the folder, even if it has the same group as the userid
running the process and has 660 permission, e.g.:

-rw-rw----  1 nancym  mcgough  blah blah blah    folder1
-rw-rw----  1 ii      mcgough  blah blah blah    folder2

I'm able to look at both folder1 and folder2 using less or more
but if I'm logged in as nancym and try to open folder2 using pine
I get this message:

	[Not a folder: folder2]

It would be great if the next release of pine would let me open
a folder like this, but if you don't allow that it would be good
to give a more informative error message, e.g. "Not owned by you."

Thanks,
Nancy

Hmm not sure.  But I would almost bet you that if you use SHIFT-backspace
it will delete.

As to the justify problem:

This may not work depending on your setup.. but if we're talking
about UNIX, Upload your file to your directory (outside of pine)

Startup pine, When in the header's area hit ctrl-r, go to
the attachment's field.  Enter the filename and path you uploaded.
Bingo.

Hello:

I have just installed the Popclient. Unfortunately, I cannot use it.
As a result, I wonder if there is FAQ about the pop. If the answer is
negative, would you please answer the following urgent questions:

Q1: How to read an email in spool from the remote server using popclient?
Q2: How to read an email in a file(e.g. mbox) from the remote server using 
    popclient?
Q3: How to use popclient to send an mail from the local machine but using
    the email account in the server? (E.g. I'm using the popclient in 
    machine X and the server is machine Y. Whether or not do I use the
    popclient to send a mail with myname@Y.pku.edu.cn?)

Thanks in advance.

Hi folks:

I think Pine has lot many features than ELM.  I use both PINE 3.91
and ELM.  PINE is more user-friendly compared to ELM.  One can view
all the commands on the menu in PINE. In ELM one needs to take help
from a help list.

But one good feature of ELM is that it works on VI editor.  So, most
of the VI commands can be used.

Thanks.

Premnath, T.

In Pine 3.91 you can set up an "alternate editor" (such as "vi") which you
can flip to (by typing Ctrl/_) whilst editing the message body. 

In fact you can even set a feature variable so that your alternate editor
is invoked automatically as soon as you move the cursor down into the
message text area.

I use Telix to call a BBS that has Pine on a Unix box.  I have Telix

without expanding blank lines with the same results.  I have even tried 
using THREE blank lines between each paragraph but it still justified 
them all together.  The next thing I will try is changing the blank lines 
to 65 spaces.

I only wish I could use elm instead of pine!  From a user's point
of view elm is vastly superior, but it's such a pain in the ass
to get it to compile that on this site I'm stuck with pine.  I've
gotten used to it by now, but it still does enough irritating
things that I'd switch to elm instantly if given the choice.

(My leading gripes: even setting the signature at end variable
won't put my .signature after, rather than before, the text of
forwarded mail, and pine won't insert signature dashes so I have
to have a different .sig for pine than for the rest of the world.
Plus I hate the number of menus and the counterintuitive key
bindings: 'm' has meant compose mail in every mailer I've used
since Mail, but now every time I hit m I end up staring at the
main menu.)

Not to dog on pine too much -- it's better than mush, at least.

Not only that, there is no way to stop invoking alternate editor 
implicitly with pine.conf.fixed, and you can make a shell you editor, 
thus gaining access to a shell from a restricted menu!

I don't think I agree with you on this...

I've just tried adding the following to our "fixed" configuration file:

feature-list=no-enable-alternate-editor-implicitly,
	...any other features you want to fix...

The "no-" prefix indicates these feature-list values are to be forced "off"
(omitting the "no-" forces a value on).  Any feature-list values not
listed in the "fixed" configuration file can be altered by the user;
ones listed cannot.

Doesn't this happen for you?  (We're using Pine 3.91)

Splunge.

Here's what I like about pine:
1) Supports remote mailboxes via IMAP.
2) My wife can use it; doesn't have to learn cryptic VI commands.

Here's what I like about elm:
1) Smaller, less code bloat (makes a difference on some old Sparcs we have
with only 8M of RAM. :(
2) Doesn't include a newsreader (trn IMHO is the best NR out there, the one
builtin to pine is slow and I never use it.)
3) OS/2 port available.

So, for me, if elm directly supported POP or IMAP, I would prefer it, but it
doesn't, so it's basically a tossup.

If you can do without the systemwide pine.conf file, use

	pine -P pinerc.generic -p pinerc.special

would like to design a GUI for it. Or for 3.92 if it is to be released
soon.

Thank in advance.

Hey, Piners.

Please note that it isn't what Dave Miller wrote but what his header 
says.  He's using Pine 3.92!

It must be close.

I don't means any editor not vi and not pico.
I means simple cut text from another xterm and put into pine.
I have no problem when set automatic vi as editor.
But this will slow down the process because I have to quit vi
before sending mail by pine.

BTW: where should I set :se wm=0
It doesn't exist in .pinerc

When will we see hooks in pine to do address lookup via qi/cso servers ?

I can think of one way to do it, like an address book item which

the address of the cso server.

I must admit that in pegasis mail that lookup feature, though tied to
the novell username list, is quite handy

At the university, I use pine 3.91.  When looking at my mail archives
(containing both sent and received mail) there, the messages I received
are labeled with the name of the sender in the index, while the messages I
sent are indicated with "To: ...". 

While reading the archives at home (pine 3.91 on Linux), the messages I 
sent are indicated with my name, instead of "To: ...", as on that system, 
jmwislez@eduserv.rug.ac.be (my university address) is a stranger.  

How can I tell pine that I am both <jmw@wonko> and <jmwislez@eduserv...>, 
to be able to see the recipient in the index instead of my own name ?

Please send any reply to <jmwislez@eduserv.rug.ac.be>, as I do not 
regularly check this newsgroup.

I've been using Pine3.91 on an AIX 3.2.5 system for some time now.  We've
recently upgraded to AIX 4.1, and I'm not sure if that's causing the
following problem or not.

In the past, I've been automatically prompted on a monthly basis as to
whether or not I'd like to move my default-fcc file to a file-mmm-yyy
archive file.  For the past two months, I've not received this prompt.
I've searched the Pine FAQ and the Pine configuration screen, but I can't
find anything that controls this (perhaps I'm missing something obvious).
Does anyone know what might be causing this problem?  Thanks!

If you're referring to wrapping when using vi, that is controlled
by the vi configuration, not the pine configuration.  Most
systems will set up vi with a polite right margin, wide enough
that quoted text won't start wrapping onto the next line.

In any case, the vi variable involved is the wrapmargin, or wm.
It's the margin from the right, so the command

:se wm=1

on an 80-column terminal will wrap lines after column 79.  If you

:se wm=0

then vi will stop auto-wrapping entirely.

You can permanently configure vi by editing your .exrc to include
a line like

set wrapmargin=X

where X is whatever margin you prefer.

case matters. If the addressbook is all lower case, and you enter the
id in upper or mixed case, this happens.

I corrected this by just putting the fully qualified address into the
addressbooks.

After setting the wrapmargin to 8 or so, you will probably want to
reformat a paragraph since wrapmargin works only when the cursor moves
past the selected column.

The following mapping in your .exrc file will allow you to
automatically reformat a paragraph:

                  map ^O {!}fmt^M}j

Give it a try.  Remember the ^M must be entered as ^V^M to get a real
^M into the .exrc file.

Pine does the same thing to me, in a most impresive way.  

I usually run Pine 3.91 in a Terminal window on my NeXTstation, running
NextStep 3.1.  If I copy & paste text into the window running Pine (or
Pico), the pasted text is automatically justified into a single large
paragraph, regardless of any blank lines. 

The wierdest part happens if any following paragraphs are "too close". 
The pasted text "gobbles up" the existing text, and lines of each get
mixed together, and then the whole thing gets justified.  What a mess! 

This doesn't make any sense to me.  Pasting text into a window should have
the exact same results as typing it in, right? 

I've also found another way to reproduce this bug, for those of you who
aren't lucky enough to use NextStep.  Use any(?) IBM-PC vt100 terminal
emulation program, login to your UNIX box, run Pine or Pico, and do an
ASCII upload of a UNIX-format text file.  I.e. text lines separated only
by a single line-feed (0x0a), rather than DOS's normal CR-LF.

That's what I figured, which is why I said it must be getting close.

So, any idea how one becomes a Beta Tester?  I'd be willing to ring it out.

I finally figured out why Pico was justifying everything I ASCII

line.  LF is the same as control J which is the command Pico uses for 
justify.  One I told Telix to strip linefeeds everything worked correctly.

That is basically correct.  By this definition, Pine 3.92 went into Alpha
a day or so after 3.91 was released.

If you support an architecture that we don't have here at UW and have the
resources to make the necessary changes and send us patches fairly
quickly, let me know.  I'm not saying we are any where near ready to send
anything out, but it would be nice to have a list when we need it...

I don't know if it will help you or not, but it actually uses the umask of
the creator to decide what mode to make the new file.  So, you could
replace the chmod  above by something which caused the umask to be 22
instead of 77.

Good idea.  I'll add it in the next version.  Thanks.

Simone,
Sorry I took so long to respond - busy schedule.
Start at the Unix Comp Prompt:
1) Type vacation <enter>
2) If it's your first time to use vacation, the program will display an 
   editing screen (using the default editor - in most cases vi).
3) Make any changes that you want in your auto message text.
4) If you are using vi, type :Q <enter>
5) You will see the following prompt.
   You have a message file in /export/home2/shortcrs/short1/.vacation.msg
   Would You like to see it?
6) Answer Y <Enter> if you would like to review the current message.
7) You will see the contents of the message followed by:
   Would you like to edit it?
8) Answer N <enter> if the message is ok.
9) You will see the following prompt:
   To enable the vacation feature a .forward file is created.
   Would you like to enable the vaction feature?
10)Answer y <enter>

The vacation message is now enabled.  Each person sending you mail gets a 
message back stating the contents of the message file that you created.

To Disable the Vacation Message 
Remove or rename the .forward file.
rm .forward <enter>  or mv .forward .oldforward <enter>
The vaction message is deactivated.

Hope this helps.

To anyone working on the next version of pine, perhaps it could be
"fixed" so that if vi is selected as the default editor, then vi
keystrokes are used =throughout= pine, including in the header/subject
areas.  It just seems rather awkward to keep mentally shifting from one
set of editing keystrokes to another if one wishes to use vi in pine.
Perhaps it is just a minor point, but after editing with vi for a
while, I =always= first press <esc>x to delete instead of <ctrl>d.

Thanks.

Hello:

I've just switched over to PINE from my previous mailer, which was ELM.
Does anyone have any hints on how to convert my lengthy ELM e-mail

Thanks.

First is it possible inside of pine or do you have
to export the message and then find a mime decoder somewhere
else on the system?  If it's possible to decode within pine
what's the command to run on the message?

Hi

Is there a way in Pine to have the ^T option used to select newsgroups
return to the list of groups after subscribing to a group?  Right now, it
puts me back in the folder list each time I subscribe to a group and then 
must retrieve the newsgroup list again.

Thanks
Jim

Someone brought this up quite a while back, but I don't recall seeing an 
answer on it from the good folks on the PINE team:

I would like to be able to define myself as:

joe@xxx.yyy
joe1@yyyy.xxz

etc, so that mail addressed to these addresses gets "+", as well as not 
being prompted for "reply to all recipients?" when one of them was me, 
and the other the sender.

This shouldn't be too had for some coder out there to supply to the pine 
folks (I suppose I could, if my boss lets me have a little free time now 
and then)

Hello pine users!
Working for few weeks with pine some questions about pine's mime
support are still unanswered.

First of all, where gets pine its information about media types?
Mosaic and netscape use mime.types files to determine the content type.
But i couldn't find out how pine does this. I created my personal
.maicaps and .mimetypes file and configured netscape to use it. So now a macintosh
binhex file is indentified by netscape and proper decoded by mcvert.
But pine still refuses to mark a macbinary file as application/applefile when
attaching a macbinary (.bin) file to a mail in pine. 

Second, is there any possibility to force pine to use a special encoding
dependent on the type of attachment?

Many thanks and best regards

Andreas

Dear Jonathan & DearOldDad [how old? - I'm 64.5]:

Thanks for the response.  However, I already knew about this feature of 
PINE. 

The real answer to my question (thanks to another helpful PINE-ist) is: 

figure out a way to download the _list_ of names/addresses [for example, one 
which was included in the BODY of an email message, or one which was set 
up on another system] into a file which you can edit so that the form of 
each line is:

	nickname<TAB>realname<TAB>emailaddress

and then append this file to your .addressbook file.

I did this fairly quickly with a list of 20 or so, altho it took a bit of 
workaround using my favorite DOS editor plus PICO.

The real trick when using computers is to figure out how to get the 
system to do as much of the work as possible.  Retyping email addressses 
is guaranteed to generate new errors.

I can't seem to get Pine to digest a mail bundle.  When I press |, it says 
that this key is not defined on this screen, or something to that effect.  
I've tried it from both the message index and when reading the actual 
message.  Is there something that I'm missing.

Please help!  I don't want to have to go back to Elm!

Btw, please mail your replies.

Try this:

Packet Drivers

Pine needs to be made aware of the PC's  net-
work  configuration  file.   Simply  edit the
file WATTCP.CFG included in the Pine  distri-
bution.   The  file  includes 5 configuration
settings--IP-address,    gateway,    netmask,
nameserver(s)  and domainslist. If you have a
network configuration file  for  NCSA  Telnet
then  WATTCP.CFG is just a pared down version
of the  CONFIG.TEL  file  you  already  made.
Take a look at CONFIG.TEL to find the correct
settings for WATTCP.CFG.  Once the configura-
tion  file is made, the DOS environment vari-
able WATTCP.CFG needs to point  at  it.   For
example:

set WATTCP.CFG=C:\PINE



In addition to  networking  software  issues,  you
might  need  to worry about setting the time zone.
PC-Pine includes the time zone as part of outgoing
email.  There is a generic way for PC applications
to get the time zone, but, because PC-Pine is  one
of  a  very  few  applications which requires this
information, time zone  might  not  be  previously
configured.

The trick is to add an environment  variable,  TZ,
to your PC's AUTOEXEC.BAT file. The format for the
TZ environment variable is as follows:

               ZZZ[+H]H[:MM:SSTTT]


First is the 3-letter code for your standard time,
then  a  "+" or a "-" for direction of offset from
GMT, then the amount of  offset  (hours,  minutes,
seconds)  and  finally  the 3-letter code for your
summer- or daylight savings time.   Everything  in
[] brackets is optional.

    The default time zone is "PST-8PDT" (U.S.  Pacific
Time).  Coincidentally, Microsoft is headquartered
in that time zone.

As an example, people in the Eastern part  of  the
US  should  add  this  line  to their AUTOEXEC.BAT
files:

                   TZ=EST-5EDT

You can pass parameters to Pine when starting it. An example is:

pine -p file  Uses the named file as the personal configuration file 
instaed of ~/pinerc.

pine -P file will override the system configuration.

pine -option=value assign value to the confg option option.

Look and/or do a more or a man on .profile   The first line say 
MAIL=user/mail$<LOGNAME:?>

Then check out the .pirnerc file and the variable personal-name.  That 
should do it for you.

Is there any way to do it automatically?  That is, to add new addresses to 
existing lists without having to type them in again?

    From the Main Menu (provided you are using version 3.91), go into 
Setup / Configuration and enable-unix-pipe-command (or however it is 
exactly worded).  This should allow you to pipe a message.  I don't know 
about a whole folder at once (although a folder is a file in itself).

With the message on-screen type T to 'take address' then follow on-screen 
prompts like give it a nickname, etc.  It will add it to your addressbook.

It's your communications software that's doing this to you.  I have had 
the problem with Telix, but not with Hayes SmartCom.

To anyone knowledgeable about IMAP/POP servers:

I have been using Mac Eudora successfully on POP-equipped machines for a
few years now at various instututions.  I have just moved to Seattle, and
find that the U of Washington does not seem to support POP and uses IMAP
instead. I had thought that POP was standard.

I am seeking advice on a good IMAP client (ideally, a Eudora-esque, or
even an IMAP-Eudora) and any information about IMAP vs. POP.  I have
investigated Mailstrom which seems pretty antiquated (the U distributes v.
1.05), and pine causes me to use up too much time over dialup lines. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated, feel free to email me personally.

That part I know.  I don't want to add them to my addressbook.  I want to 
add them to distribution lists that are already in my addressbook.  I 
want to be able to invoke the "Z" command inside the "T" command.

automatically at the bottom of messages.  Well... I've typed S (for set 
up) the C (for configuration), got to "signature at bottom" I have read and 
*follow* the instructions obtained by pressing help(?)...Used Pico, wrote a 
coouple of lines and an inspiring quote from "Don Quijote" and saved to the 
file "signature", checked (again) the signature at bottom feature and... 
nothing, nothing, nothing!...
Could anubody please help me before I destroy my computer and modem?
Thank you very much!

In your home directory create a file named  .forward

and it it put the line

username@site.name

Where username is your login ID for your new site and where site.name is 
the name of the site where your login ID is.

This can be used for many mail programs.

At my site the above would be accomplished by doing the following at the 
unix command line, while in my home directory:

touch .forward

edit .forward

username@site.name

[then save and close the file.]

There are more complicated ways to do this, such as using procmail.
For information regarding this type

man forward

from the unix prompt.  Or for info on procmail type

man procmail

If anyone has an idea, I would love it.  I have read and read an just 
seem to get deeper.

I dial in from a DOS machine to a unix server (home to school).  I then 
use pine (version 3.89) to read and write.  

I want to be able to dial in, collect my mail, get off and read/reply 
without tying up my phone line or the school's.  

I have read about PPP and SLP but don't know how to tell if we even have 
that.  I have printed the Unix manual pages for mail, mailx, write, 
sendmail, environ and still can't find it.

I have also heard the term SOUP.  I do this on other BBS's using .QWK 
packs.  It has allowed me to writed scripts to dial in at 2am and pick 
up/deliver mail all over.

Thanks

Well, if it comes down to it, it wouldn't be all *that* hard to convert 
pine into another language.  With a little help, a version could easily 
be made.  If anyone wants a french or spanish version, I will write one.

There is a simple way to do this.  Just set your personal name using

    If you are on a Un*x system, your signature file should be named 
precisely ".signature", not "signature".  Note the leading period.  This 
is the default in the Un*x world.  Also, it usually resides in your home 
directory.  However, with Pine, you may go into the configuration and 
give your signature file another name.  Check to make sure everything is 
in synch.

This is the typical linking with curses problem on AIX, just link it with 
termcap instead of curses and find yourself a decent termcap file and 
you're all set.

Hello,

I posted a message the other day regarding converting ELM aliases to PINE
addressbook.

I was also wondering how to format multiple addresses into one alias on
PINE. For example, I maintain a list of about 30 people whom I mail to
reguarly, all located on my old ELM alias called "list1", how do I format
this list into my PINE addressbook??

In ELM, I would simple do the following:

list1 = list1

Thanks to everyone who answered my question about making the pipe command 
work.  Now another question:

When I pipe to "digest", like I was doing with Elm, imagine my surprise when 
the Pine view screen came back with a message that looked like _Elm's_ 
message index!  Well, I dropped to the shell and typed "digest", and it said 
that I should only run it from Elm.

Apparently, there are different programs for digesting with different mail 
readers.  Could you point me to a digester for Pine?

Thanks in advance!  Also, please mail your replies.

Hello:

I am posting this message on behalf of a friend.  Please reply directly
to him at s832816@aix2.uottawa.ca (the default if you "reply" to this
message).

He was wondering if there was any way to request receipt notification
and/or read notification when sending a mail message using Pine.  I have
looked on my Pine but wasn't able to figure out how to do so (it doesn't
seem to be in the rich headers).

Any information would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

I assume you mean 3.91, unless you know something I don't.  The best site 
is http://www.cac.washington.edu:1180/pine/   Lottsa good stuff there.

To be able to use Pine 3.91 (LAN Workplace version) in a public cluster, I
need to completely disable the ability of a user to enter a fake return
address or name.  I have been able to hack a solution on the Mac side by
removing the text fields for a return name and address, the result being
that a user's e-mail has only his or her true e-mail address in the From
field in the header.  Is this possible in Pine?  I have looked at the
release notes, FAQ, and Web site, but with no luck.

Thanks in advance for any advice on this problem.

Hi all!

I use PINE 3.91 for mail and news. Many users asked me if i can 
deactivate the MIME-support, because their news-reader have problems with 
MIME. They always have '=20'-sequences in my messages.

I don't want to take another newsreader, but then i must deactivate MIME. 
Who can i do that??

Help per PMail wanted! (Or Cc of your posting).
         ^^^^^
THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH FOR HELPING ME!

First: I'm sorry, but my english ist very bad!!!!
I don't know if i really understand your question, because it seems a 
very simple problem (->online help). You have to save a file (name: 
.signature) in your home-directory. Or you choose another name and configure 
to the setup. Or use control+R (Read File).

X-Status: 

To be able to use Pine 3.91 (LAN Workplace version) in a public
cluster, I need to completely disable the ability of a user to enter a
fake return address or name.  I have been able to hack a solution on
the Mac side by removing the text fields for a return name and address
in Mail Drop, the result being that a user's e-mail has only his or her
true e-mail address in the From field in the header.  Is this possible
in Pine?  I have looked at the release notes, FAQ, and Web site, but
with no luck.

Thanks in advance for any advice on this problem.

It is not Pine that needs to know about the terminal you are emulating,
but the Unix system you are running Pine on.  Check the value of your TERM
environment variable.  Either ANSI or VT100 emulation should work with
Pine...

Pine encodes and decodes MIME attachments transparently.  If a message
arrives with a MIME atachment, you should be able to just go to the
ViewAttch screen and view/save/pipe/print the attachment(s)...

How can I configure pine to view a MIME attachment with the following 
headers:

  MIME-Version: 1.0
  Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=XXCGW-1064791400XX
  Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary
  ...
  Content-Type: application/octet-stream; name="HEXEDIT.TXT"
  Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
  Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="HEXEDIT.TXT"
 
When I try to view the attached file, I get the following message:

  Don't know how to display attachment format Application/OCTET-STREAM

I assume I need to configure my .mailcap file, but I'm not sure what 
should be added.  I also assume I'll need a "base64" decoding program, 
where can I find one for UNIX?

Pine currently looks at the first few bytes of an attachment to identify a
few common types that it knows about.  The next release of Pine will also

Pine takes care of the BASE64 decoding.  The problem is that whatever
program encoded the attachment apparently couldn't figure out what type of
file it was, so it used the catch-all of Application/OCTET-STREAM.  This
means you will need to save it to a file and view it from outside of Pine.
I suppose you could make a .mailcap entry to do something with
Application/OCTET-STREAM, but be careful that whatever you invoke can deal
with binary data...

Pine is trying to save you a keystroke and got it wrong.  If there is only
one address it assumes you want to create a new simple addressbook entry
instead of adding to a list.  That will be fixed in 3.92.  Here's a
workaround.  First Select the message, then instead of Taking the address
try Apply Take.

Don't you hate when that happens?  The first time that happened to me I 
had to kill the process.  I have since figured out how to get back in.
When you type ctrl-Z it prints a message telling you how to get back in.
Stopped. Type 'fg' to restart PINE.  Try it and see if it works for you

My sysop responded to the following that it's obviously a bug in PINE and
recommending that I create long messages offline and upload them.  I can
and of course will do this, but would be interested in whether you are
working to make the "postponed messages" (or perhaps some other facility)
grab anything that's active when the host is about to go down.  (I'm
spoiled -- APL used to do this 25 years ago!)

I doubt if there's anything you can do about it now, but I just lost an 
hour's careful work on a message which I had in fact "postponed" in PINE a 
couple of times, when the system locked up and then dropped the carrier.

When I logged back on, PINE first asked whether I wanted to continue the 
postponed message, than said there were no messages actually postponed.

That's smoke coming out of my ears.

... Dick
========================================================================
Obviously, I can and will write lengthy messages offline henceforward --
but it's cumbersome.  For one thing, altho it's not a PINE issue, when I
tried downloading mail and using OLX to read/respond, I discovered that
everying had also been wiped out of my PINE Inbox in the process. 

	Does anyone know of a "canned" method for downloading/uploading
	messages?  What I do now is very labor-intensive: 

	Export a copy from PINE to my UNIX directory, use sz... to
	download it to my PC, use DOS EDIT to get it into a DOS format,
	then edit it with a more friendly editor (which however does not
	automatically add "quote" marks to quoted passages), then use
	rz... to upload it to UNIX and finally import it into the PINE
	Compose function to send if by email.

Now you see why I avoided it (to my regret) in the instance reported.

Well, I am looking for the answer to what you are experiencing now.  We 
would like to 'turn OFF' the monthly folder moving option - Is this 
possible?  We are running Version 3.90 Pine on our 4.3a Ultrix machine.

Subject: Using Pine with Sendmail's userdb option

Is it possible to successfully use pine with unix sendmail's userdb 
option?  Specifically, I'm using sendmail 8.6.12.1 compiled with 
Berkeley's USERDB option.  The following is a brief desciption from the 
sendmail FAQ:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
  * How do I rewrite my From: lines to read ``First_Last@My.Domain''?

        There are a couple of ways of doing this.  This describes using
        the "user database" code.  This is still experimental, and was
        intended for a different purpose -- however, it does work
        with a bit of care.  It does require that you have the Berkeley
        "db" package installed (it won't work with DBM).

        First, create your input file.  This should have lines like:

                loginname:mailname      First_Last
                First_Last:maildrop     loginname

        Install it in (say) /etc/userdb.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

I can use this feature successfully using ELM, Mail 5.5, and by using
sendmail directly.  By that I mean my "From:" address is changed in all my
outgoing mail based on the above rule from "loginname" to "First_Last". 
Yet when I use pine, this does not happen.  Does anyone know what I need
to do to get this to work. 

Thanks.

For Pine on AIX 4.1, use the "a32" port and delete the
"include(srandom.dum)" line from pine/osdep/os-a32.ic.  I haven't tested
it extensively, but it seems to work...

You are right...  most of my problems regarding folders, files,
permissions, etc. have been solved, and they aren't PINE's fault.
They were MY fault.  However, PINE does ocassionally crash, squirting
all manner of characters onto the terminal on its way down...

But I have a more important question I would like to pose to you.
It's not anything wrong with PINE, either.

Is there some way to have the system notify users who are in
application programs that they have received mail?  Like the "write"
command?  Can SENDMAIL be configured to do this?  Or am I out of luck
altogether?

Making this more clear, regular mail goes through this mailbox too and I

We are using Pine 3.90 on our Ultrix 4.3a machine.  Is there a way to 
turn OFF the monthly folder moving feature?  Any information would be 
greatly appreciated, as this feature is quite annoying for many of our 
Pine users!

MailDrop 1.1 from Baylor University is really the leading contender
right now, although there's a commercial package called Simeon
that I'd like to know more about.

Mail Drop info:

What I'd really like to see is Eudora for IMAP. No mail package for a
similar context has Eudora's feature set, and any move away from
Eudora seems like a step backwards -- far backwards. Are you listening,
Qualcomm?

	One way to do this would be to edit the .pinerc file of each
	user and modify the following line:

	# Set by Pine; controls beginning-of-month sent-mail pruning.
	last-time-prune-questioned=95.7
                                   ^^^^
	Change this to 99.12 and Pine won't ask the monthly question 
	until Jan. 2000. 
	
	I have done this for several of my users and it works with
	Pine 3.91.

At the % prompt in your unix account, type the following:

Replace in the above the actual address you want the mail be forwarded to.

How come you have configured Pine3.91 in such a way to allow editing of the

Comment out that option in the "osdep/os-xxx.h" file in the pine src kit,
and recompile. Then the option to edit the From: header will be disabled.

I'm trying to run pine from an NFS client (where the password file contains a

It works fine from the YP server. I tried looking through the FAC and didn't

I'm resorting to the newsgroup. 

Has anybody seen this message before? How can I let pine know who I am?

Please e-mail to jgarcia@cse.ucsc.edu, since I don't read this newsgroup 
regularly. Thanks!

Jorge

Yes. Just create a ".forward" file in your account and include in it the
address to which you want to forward your mail.

Here's what I've done to automate downloading mail to my PC for
offline reading.  It's a bit of a Rube Goldberg patchwork, but,
hey, it works.
 
I dial into a Unix machine (local Internet access provider) from
my IBM-like PC.  My communications program (Hayes Smartcom for 
Windows) has a script language, also it had a capture to disk 
function.  On the Unix machine I use Pine 9.1, which has a 
select command plus an aggregate command function (apply the same 
Pine command to a set of selected messages).  
 
Since I subscribe to several listservs, I have set up a script to
select and flag mail from each one and export them from my Pine
Inbox to separate files in my Unix directory.  I then go to the
Unix shell and run a script to open my PC disk capture files and
execute the Unix cat file command; as the exported mail files fly 
by on the screen I capture them to my hard disk.
 
To go in reverse, I compose replys offline using the DOS edit.
When I want to send them, I use the autotype function of Pine, which
copies in my reply files as if I am typing them into Pine (but much
faster, of course).
 
All this may or may not apply to your situation, and you may or may
not want to duplicate it.  If you do and want more info, I would
be glad to assist.
 
Regards,
Phil

So have two configuration files (.pinerc and for instance .mail-list and
for mailing list, start the pine with `-p $HOME/.mail-list' option.

with PROCOMM for windows, version 2.1 or higher -- I think I Have the

Of course they have selected "attached-to-ainsi."

I discovered that it is the line feeds that are the problem.  Pico uses

feed.  If you don't want Pico to justify what you upload you have to not 
send any line feeds.

Hello,

we compiled imapd 3.6 BETA on a sun with solaris 2.4.

It is possible to read the mailbox. But when the mailbox (/var/mail/user)
on the server has to be written to disk after usage the mailbox content
gets garbled.

We believe that the Problem is in the routine
bezerk_write_message in the file c-client/bezerk.c.
We believe that the writev systemcall causes the problem.

We get the following messages:

Jul 11 10:24:23 harry imapd[17064]: Retrying after disk error user=testuser
host=arielle.Informatik.RWTH-Aachen.DE mbx=/var/mail/testuser: Invalid argument

Is this a known problem? Are there bug-fixes, workarounds or patches?

Sincerely,

Guido Bunsen

I have accounts on two systems which offer pine.  On my unix system, pine
works beautifully and always has.  However, pine was recently installed on
my vax system and I'm having problems with the newsreader (same remote
newserver I use from the unix system).  Specifically, it won't let me
purge out the messages I've read with the 'D' key.  I've noticed some
other differences between pines on each system (such as fcc), and I'm
wondering if 'deleting' unwanted posts just isn't an option on the vax, if
I have something set up wrong, or if something is set up wrong system-wide
(a co-worker has the same problem).  My system administrators will not
deal with newsgroup related questions, only mail.  Any ideas?  

Thanks,

I've been developing an IMAP client for the Macintosh called Mulberry. Its currently very close to completion. Its being beta tested by a number of people in the UK, but I'd quite like to have a few international beta testers as well, so if you'd like to test it please email me:

Cyrus Daboo <cd102@phy.cam.ac.uk>

Features include:

-Full drag & drop support for messages - you can drag messages between mailboxes to copy them etc., or drag to the Finder to create a clipping file.

-Can open multiple mailbox windows.

-Mailbox windows are fully configurable - you can choose which information to have displayed (e.g. message size, message sender, subject etc).

-Outgoing mail can be automatically recorded in any mailbox.

Makes sense.  obviously Telix is a DOS program, and left to itself, it 
would conform to DOS conventions and put a CR and LF at the end of 
each line.  I have had similar problems when uploading mail with 
Commo, the com program I use.  I still say uploading and reading into 
the message is much easier, but I guess each one has its merits.

Has anyone built Pine3.91 on Solaris 2.4 ?

There are some problems with the makefile.sol, if anyone has worked around
these I would be very interested in hearing from you.

The origonal makefile.sol was for solaris 2.2 which, in the comments, 
mentions it has /usr/ucb/cc which Solaris 2.4 does not appear to have.

Any help here is greatly appreciated.

Check out http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/cyrus/email/clients-IMAP.html for
a list of IMAP clients.  I've been a big fan of Eudora, but have started
using MailDrop, and while it's not as "featureful" as Eurodra, it seems to
work well enough.

A new entry in the field seems to be a commercial program called Simeon,
which I have no experience with.  They have their own WWW site (pointed to
from the page cited above), but it's pretty useless as far as information
content goes, and is pretty high on my list of "most badly designed WWW
pages I've ever seen" :-)

Are you using a POP mailclient (Eudora?) as well as Pine at the same time?
When you are using Pine to read mail from your inbox, if there's a POP
connection to your mailbox from your POP client, then it will extract mail
from your INBOX prompting Pine to notify you about "Message Shrank"

Hi All!

I'm new to setting up Pine (3.91), and have run into a problem getting it to 
work on my RS/6000 AIX 3 system.

If the INBOX folder is empty when Pine is started, and Compose is selected
from the main menu or the folder list, then Pine hangs in the compose
screen with the cursor positioned on the "To:" field. 

The hang does not occur if the user views any folder index before
attempting to Compose a message, or if the INBOX has at least one message.

This same problem occurs in the executable I built, and in the
pre-compiled one from U.W. (pine-bin.a32).  One hitch here is I'm still on
an older 3.0 something AIX. 

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.  Please reply directly, I'm 
not on this list yet.

    -Wayne Cox     wcox@bob.wittenberg.edu

I have two problems. First the easy one. Postpone does not seem to be 
working, and it's a pain when I have cancel the message if I can't finish 
it for some reason. Do I need to set a flag in the config area or 
something to turn this on?

Second problem.. I use two internet accounts, and for a while, I would 
email a file via Pine's attachment feature from one account to the other 
and then d/l from the other site. Well, what happened was I uqwk'ed my 
mailbox before I separated the attachment. So what I have is a plain 
ascii text file of the message w/ the attachment. Is there anyway I can 
recover the file? I tried just importing the msg, but that didn't work. 
Although it's not anything vital, it would be nice to have it. :)

X-Status: 

This is a strange one.  I've got this Northern Telecom DisplayPhone 
terminal I've been using as a console on a Sun 3/60.  It works fine 
except for pico and rarely pine.

The terminal seems to be getting sent some bogus ESC commands and it's 
flipping into a memory dump mode.  This causes the terminal to start 
spewing quite a bit of info to the Sun.  Of course, pico starts seeing 
this and responds with MORE garbage.  Eventually, the Sun gets sick of 
this crap and hangs the terminal.  Since this is the console, pandemonium 
ensues.  Needless to say, I don't run pico on the console.

I want to make this work.  I think it has something to do with the 
termcap entry for the terminal.  

I think pine behaves itself becauses it accepts the xon-xoff stuff via 
the config settings.  pico doesn't seem to follow this.  Perhaps that's 
the problem?

It's very likely this is some sort of terminal over-run issue. 

Any and all suggestions are welcome, e-mail reponses preferred.

Thanks!

Bill

We had a problem with some wyze-30 terminals that use magic cookies to
emulate stuff like reverse video I think. Anyways, pico tried to do this
on a per character basis instead of per field, and extra spaces wound up
in the strings, causing line wraps and what not.

here are the diffs:

The "Bus Error" is probably coming from sendmail rather than Pine.  You
might try setting "smtp-server" in the Setup/Config screen.  Sometimes
sendmail will work better when invoked that way, or you can use a
different server entirely...

Wolfgang Friebel sent me mail about an available IMAP patch for Elm. It links
against the C-Client code in the PINE distribution, and is available as:

patch only		ftp.ifh.de:/pub/ftp/unix/mail/elm_imap.patch.tar.gz
ELM with patch applied	ftp.ifh.de:/pub/ftp/unix/mail/elm_imap-2.4.24.tar.gz
 

Perhaps this can be incorporated into Elm 2.5?


On a related subject, I have hacked on Elm 2.4pl23 to provide reasonably
secure behavior when run as "relm" instead of "elm". If there's a chance
that these changes could be incorporated into 2.5 (they're really pretty
minor, just adds a global 'restricted' variable and wraps several blocks
with if(!restricted) { ... }) then I'll take the time to make a patch file
and post/mail it.]

When run as "relm" it has the following slightly unconventional behavior:

	* reads global configuration from relmrc instead of elmrc
	* Does NOT create/use a personal elmrc or .elm directory, and thus
	  users running "relm" can't change/save the configuration.
	* Does allow users to save messages to files, most administrators
	  would probably want to disable this- make it a config. option?
	* Change folder is disabled since the command allows shell escapes
	* all pipe/shell and external viewer commands are disabled

I'm sorry, but I don't have the time to clean it up and make patches for a
few people, but I'm willing to put in the time for changes that can be
incorporated in the next release.

Half right.  PINE itself does not handle automatic mail forwarding.
PINE is only the program that you, as a user, run in order to get
access to mail (it's a "user agent" in the jargon).
 
The .forward file is handled by your computer's mail system
(typically "sendmail"), not by PINE.  That's why you won't find
much about it in PINE's documentation.

Check in the default folder for postponed messages (postponed-msgs) to
see if you really have your postponed messages listed in there. If not
you might want to see if you have a file called ".pine-interrupted*"

 +  email a file via Pine's attachment feature from one account to the other 
 +  and then d/l from the other site. Well, what happened was I uqwk'ed my 
 +  mailbox before I separated the attachment. So what I have is a plain 
 +  ascii text file of the message w/ the attachment. Is there anyway I can 
 +  recover the file? I tried just importing the msg, but that didn't work. 
 +  Although it's not anything vital, it would be nice to have it. :)

Check in to see if you still have a copy of the original mail in your
sent-mail folder within the account you sent the mail from.

Go to Edit Configuration dialog box. Click on Emul. Options and change 
the value "Emulation name" from "DEC-VT100" to "vt100".  Some UNIX 
system won't recognize the "DEC-VT100" terminal type.

Hhmmmm ... My guess is you were not in PINE you were in unix, and rm
filename means remove that filename and rm * means remove all files in the
directory.  There's one possible hope for recovery; The rm command does 
not actually delete the file, it removes the link to the file.

Removing a link (or in your case a whole bunch of links) is not really 
the same thing as deleting a file (as in DOS).

Bad news:  Now DOS has an undelete command, but unix doesna have an
unremove command. 

Good news:  Removing a link is not really the same as deleting, there may 
be more than one link to the file(s), and unix will not delete the actual 
file until the last link is removed.

Bad news:  In most cases (and probably in yours) there is only one link 
to a file, so removing this link deletes the file.

I'm gonna cross-post this to a unix comp group, and maybe someone else 
can help you out, 'cause that's the extent of my knowledge, and maybe 
someone else can take this further.  Hope this helps.  G'Day.

 +  Half right.  PINE itself does not handle automatic mail forwarding.

 +  The .forward file is handled by your computer's mail system

How can I set the distribution of messages in Usenet when I'm within Pine?
I have some want ads that I don't want tto end up in Australia.
Can the Pine wizards respond to my address as well as here?
(picky..huh?)

Thank you, virtual lumberjacks.

Hello friends,

I know, AIX 1.2 is really old, but it is running here (maybe for years 
...sniff!). So, is it possible to get Pine running on this old 386 IBM PS/2? 

Thanks in advance 

Ciao

Usenet News articles can be restricted to particular collections of news 
servers by including and setting a header line in your article of the form:

	Distribution: identifier

Note that you can't just pick any old thing for "identifier".  Basically 
it must be something that your (and other, if appropriate) news servers 
understand.  For example most news servers understand not to pass "local" 
articles beyond your own site.  Similarly "world" (the default if the 
header is omitted) go everywhere.  However whether a news server decides 
to pass on your article depends upon it recognising the identifier, and 
being configured appropriately.

So you need to persuade Pine to allow you to include an additional 
"Distribution:" header when you compose a message/article.

This is achieved in the same way as for other headers such as 
"Reply-to:".  Specifically:

*  In Pine 3.91 go to the Setup Configuration screen (S then C from the 
Main Menu).

*  Move down to the "customized-hdrs" variable.

*  Add a new header by typing "A".  As the value enter:
	Distribution:
   and press Return.
   (You can actually set up a default value that will always be used -- 
   unless you change it within the message -- by including it after the 
   ":".  For example,
	Distribution: local
   )

*  Leave the Setup Configuration screen by typing "E".

*  Now when you compose a message you can see this additional header 
(along with some extra standard ones) by placing the cursor on any of the 
usual header fields and type Ctrl/R (Rich Headers).  You can then give or 
modify the value for the "Distribution:" field value.

Note that if you set up a default value for the field you do NOT need to 
type Ctrl/R for the header to be used.  Ctrl/R merely *shows* you the 
headers and allows you to change them.

I would suggest NOT giving "Distribution:" a default value -- leave it 
blank.  This is because it doesn't make much sense for any e-mail 
messages you send, and it would be better to add a value only for 
appropriate Usenet News articles you're posting.

I don't know about that specific combination, but there is a
commercial port of PINE included in the PMDF package, or there
is a free port of PINE by Yehavi Bourvine in Israel, and you can
read my experiences with it and pointers to the package itself
and further information :
 
http://ppewww.ph.gla.ac.uk/%7Eflavell/vms-pine.html
 
I've no reason to suppose it wouldn't build with your
particular platform.  You don't say which TCP/IP you are
using: if it isn't Multinet then you'll also need a free
network library package called NETLIB.

Whenever I send message that include text imported from an ASCII file
(edited by 'pico'), I see it ok on screen but most of the people who
receive such message, get it garbled with '=20' at the end of lines.

Another problem:
Sometimes after running the 'spell' process, attempting to 'perform take
address' on more than 50 addresses, Pine terminates stating there is a bug.
Why does this happen and how can I get back without loosing
what I was working on.

Please reply directly to my account.

I use QuickLink II and the only problem I have is if I get to fast with 
the fingers.  i.e.  I don't wait for it to finish printing to my local 
printer.  Then it doesn't seem to turn the print off.  I have to quit out 
of Pine and go back in.  Also the screen scrolls off into never never land.

Hello All,

I am looking for a nice public domain mail tool for my PC. The current tool 
"Eudora" is OK but it has it's own limitations.

 
I want to be able to do the following things with it on a my PC:
 
 * Should be able to send mail out without any problems.
 
 * Should have aliasing capability including alias for aliases.
 
 * Should be able to insert files in the message area from any of my 
   directories on my PC and be able to edit it while I am composing messages.

 * Should have the ability to beep me when the mail arrives.

 * Should have folders capability.
 
 * Should have multiple signatures appending capability
 
 * Any other fancy features are welcome.
 
Any help in this regards is much appreciated. Also, a direct mail will be
greatly appreciated.

Tuesday, 11 July 1995

Since yesterday I am experienceing an anamoly with Linux-based PINE.  I sent
e-mail from my VAX VMS account at school to my Linux account.  I login
sucessfully into my Linux account, and it reports that I have new mail. 
However, I go into PINE to view the new mail, and I get messages similar to
"Message 0 of 0" within PINE.

My mail is on my Linux account, but PINE will not show it to me.  I know it is
on my Linux account-- somewhere.  I just do not know where else to look.  It
should be in the /var/spool/mail/xxxxx directory (xxxxx = username), but bash
(Bourne-again shell) tell me that xxxxx is not a directory.

How can I get PINE back to normal so that it recognizes my incoming mail?  I
would greatly appreciate whatever help you can provide me, and I thank you in
advance for that help.

Very respectfully,

Martin Cubas (cubasm@hartwick.edu) <=- VAX

/var/spool/mail/xxxxx is usually a file rather than a directory, so you
might double-check that.  Also check the "inbox-path" in the Setup/Config
screen.  If there is a value there, try deleting it...

If you want to attach it as text so that it appears as part of your
message then you can simply hit ^R for Read File when the cursor is in the
"Message Text" field of your outgoing message. Pine will paste the
contents of the file into your message. It will appear as text, as if you
had typed it in. If you want the file to appear as a MIME encoded
attachment, (a coded file which is held separately from the text --
appropriate for GIFs, binaries, LARGE text files, etc.) then move the
cursor up into the header area of the message and enter the file name into
the Attchmnt: line. It's that simple!

Hi,

Is there a way to convert pine aliases to the .mailrc format?  My real
goal is to move my aliases from pine on my unix account to Eudora on my
mac.

I would appreciate a CC by email.

Thanks,

Forgetting about Pine for a moment...

The usual way of reading and sending e-mail messages is to use a mailer 
program.  This lets you read messages that have been delivered to your 
mail file on your computer, and to send messages out (usually directly or 
indirectly using the SMTP protocol).

Usenet News is slightly different in that articles don't get delivered to 
a personal file "just for you".  Instead they are held in a central, 
shared directory.  They then can be accessed directly by a news reading 
program as part of the normal filestore, or by the special news protocol 
"NNTP".

Now for Pine...

Pine is an integrated mailer and news reader program.  It attempts to 
provide a consistent, coherent interface so that whether you are reading, 
sending or replying to e-mail or news articles it "feels" the same.  And 
overall it does a pretty good job; we have many users here who probably 
wouldn't have got into Usenet News if they'd had the hurdle of learning 
yet another program whilst also battling the newsgroups themselves.

So, if you're asking "can I send Usenet News articles using a mail 
program" then the answer is "Yes".  Pine will let you read and post 
articles using the NNTP protocol, assuming you have access to a news 
server that allows you to both read and post articles.

However in some cases people only have access to news servers that allow 
them to _read_ news (not post their own articles).  For example, it may 
be a limited service available to people not working at a particular 
establishment.

If this is your case, then the question becomes "can I send an e-mail 
message somewhere to get it magically converted into an article in a 
newsgroup?"  The answer is again yes... you will need to send the message 
to a Mail-to-News gateway computer.  Typically a newsgroup with name

	comp-sys-blah@news.gateway.machine

Note the change of the "."s to "-"s.

The nitty gritty is where such machines are.  I know there are some 
publiclly useable ones....  but their addresses elude my memory at 
present.  Perhaps someone else can remember?  (Wasn't one run by DEC?)

It's a two-stage process...

First (using Pine 3.91) you need to enable an extra command for diaplying 
the full headers.  You do this by going into the Setup Configuration 
screen (S then C from the Main Menu).  Now move down to 
"enable-full-header-cmd" and make sure it is crossed.  Leave the Setup 
Configuration Screen by typing E (Exit).

Now when you're reading a message an extra command is available to you.  
The "H" command will now display the message with full headers.  Another 
"H" hides them again.

This is because your message text includes one or both of these:

	*  At least one character with an ASCII code out of the "usual"
	   range (32 through 126).
	*  At least one Very Long (several hundred?) characters long.

When either of these is true the message text is encoded using "Quoted 
Printable" encoding, a part of the MIME specification.

When triggered Quoted Printable protects certain characters.  For example,
	*  "Funny" characters are sent as "=XX", where "XX" is their ASCII
	   character code expressed in hexadecimal.
	*  Spaces at ends of lines or wrapped lines get protected ("=20").
	*  Certain control characters normally accepted (eg, Tab) get
	   protected (Tab becomes "=09").

If the recipient is using a MIME-aware mailer then the Quoted Printable 
encoding is automagically undone before the message text is displayed in 
its original glory.  However if the recipient isn't using a MIME-aware 
mailer they get to see all the "=XX" stuff.

One solution is for the sender to make sure they don't trigger Quoted 
Printable encoding when they send the message.  Another solution is for 
the recipient to move to a modern MIME-aware mailer.  :-)

Hi,

I've just been trying to install Pine 3.91 on a cluster of DEC Alphas running
OSF/1, and I can't quite get it to work right. Here is the situation: Several 
workstations are connected to a serverto which incoming mail is delivered. 
Users $HOME directories are NFS-mounted from the server, but the incoming
mailbox /var/spool/mail/$USER is local to each machine.

Now when Pine starts up on any machine I want it to look in the INBOX on the
server for that person. This means using imapd. I've tried installing imapd
on the server and even on the client, but when you start Pine connection from 
one of the client machines I get the message 'connection refused'. 

Anybody got any idea about this? The server definitely knows about the client
because they are NFS-sharing disks :-) The Pine technical notes say something
about using rimap, but I can't follow this at all. I am using a pine.conf.fixed
file on each machine to tell it where to look for the INBOX. Could the syntax 
of this be causing problems? (if I use a clients pine.conf.fixed on the server,
then the server refuses connection to it's own INBOX!) 

In short has anyone set up a Unix cluster in this way? How have you done it?!!
I'd be very (very) grateful for your ideas.

If it's a mailer then it should not have any problems with mails, right?

"alias" and "group alias".
Most mailers do that now.

That's an "editor" issue.
Granted, a mailer might have an "internal editor", but why reinvent the wheel?

> * Should have the ability to beep me when the mail arrives.

This depends on how mail arrives on your PC.
It should thus be bound to the program which receives the mail (MTA).
The mailer should not be used for that.  Otherwise you'd have to keep the
mailer running all the time - not good as the mailer probably does a lot more
than just check the mailbox and thus requires a lot more RAM than a simply
utility.

> * Should have folders capability.

You mean "save a mail to a file"?
Have you ever seen a mailer who doesn't have this?

> * Should have multiple signatures appending capability

Now, this isn't something a mailer is for.  Use a script to do that!
Better yet - don't use a signature at all.

I think this is a general request about a mailer so I have set
"Followup-To: comp.mail.misc".
I'm sure both ELM and PINE will have all the capabilities you want.
Just install a UNIXish system (eg LINUX) on your PC and you can install both
and select the better one.
I also left out "zmail" from the newsgroups list as I dunno whether it applies.

Also you may need to configue you .pinerc file in you home directory as below:
localsignature=~/.signature
remotesignature = ~/.signature

Has anyone installed Pine on a UNISYS box. Could you provide me with some compiler falgs, etc hat might help.  PICO compiles fine, but Pine blows up.

Thanks for the info,

Ummm...... Pine doesn't have "localsignature" and "remotesignature" 
variables to configure, at least not in a standard release of Pine 3.91.  
Are you thinking of Elm?

For Pine, there is one variable, called "signature-file", which specifies
the name of the file to be used as a signature.  On UNIX this defaults to
a file called ".signature" in your home directory.

Howdy folks,

I someone could give me some direction, I would greatly appreciate it.
I am presently setting up a Unixware machine that for now is a 
standalone machine.  However, since I dislike mail and mailx, I want
to have pine running.  I found that I had to link /usr/ucblib/sendmail to
/usr/lib/sendmail and set the domainname.  However the mail never gets
sent.  Typing in a user name in the "to:" field expands to
user@machinename.domainname.  But upon attempting to a message to another
user on the machine, it is returned because it cannot find the host.

Does anybody out there have this done?  Perhaps I need to set a few
things in the sendmail.cf file.

Thanks for all your help in advance.

Has support for VMSMail transport been removed from the latest (free)
version of Pine?  I'm still running v3.89 (if it ain't broke...), and I
didn't even bother with Netlib--you can tell Pine to call VMS Mail to send
outbound messages.  There are a few drawbacks -- you can't use IMAP or POP
servers, you can't read news, and you can't speak properly to LISTPROC due
to a problem with headers, but it lets me read and send mail without any
trouble at all.  I've heard that it's a bit slower this way, but I haven't
noticed any problems.  If all you need is inbound-outbound mail, just set it
up to run with VMS mail and avoid the headaches.

For reference, I'm running Pine VMS Pine 3.89beta under VMS 5.5 on a 7-node
cluster with UCX on 6 nodes and a third-party TCPIP package on the seventh. 
We're also running PMDF, but the PMDF version of Pine is not installed.

I use PINE on a UNIX system (world.std.com). I would like to 
download a selected PINE mail folder (e.g. to-reply-later) to 
my DOS pc and then convert the folder to a dbase file. 

Presently I must use Delrina's "Internet Messenger" to direct 
dial (rather than telnet) world.std.com, then "Internet 
Messenger" downloads the messages to my pc and stores them in 
dbase III compatible files. Hence the conversion of mail 
folders to dbase files is technically possible. 

How can I convert a PINE mail folder to a dbase file without 
using "Internet Messenger" ?

If thought that was bad, then you should have seen their most un-"Macintosh" 
like program Mac ECSMail which is the fore-runner to this Simeon. I tested 
for my old University the Mac Beta 2.x version of ESCMail and it was a very 
sad copy of the MS Windows based IMAP client program. I have not tried 
testing Simeon though I do still hope for the best...... However, my 
current University denies a Macintosh version exists, so I'll have to 
wait and see. 

I currently use Mail Drop, which is very good though still lacks the 
multiple mailbox feature.

Just select DEC-VT100 and do the followings..

You can change the emulation name in Options:Configuration:Emul. 
Options:Emulation Name. For example, you can rename DEC-VT100 to "vt100" 
or whatever. By doing this, when EWAN connect to remote machine, it'll 
tell remote machine that it is using "vt100" emulation instead of the 
default name "DEC-VT100".

It works fine for me now.

Hi,

I've compiled up Pine on an SGI Indy under Irix 5.3, and also under
SunOS4.1.3 OK.   I'm working on pine 3.91.

However, our mail spool is on the Sun, and when exported to the SGI
machine the Indy pine hangs on opening the spool, presumably a problem
with locking the file.

Is this a known problem with Pine, or just generic with Sun/SGI mounts?

Comments/fixes (maybe some option on the SGI fstab entry for the
mail spool mount?) welcome.

I guess the answer is I should be using IMAP :)

Cheers,
Tim

the mac 2.x was as you say, a rotten (and never working) cheap port
of a windows interface, and i'm glad it was never really released..
it was so far from "the right thing" its not funny.

the new simeon interface is much better; in fact the entire metaphor
was borrowed straight from the mac finder (the hierarchical list view).  
it is a much nicer system and much more consistent.  there were a few
complaints early on from some windows folk who thought it looked too much 
like a mac interface mind you. :-)

caveat: i designed the interface

I've also had problems with dec-vt100.  On my version of Ewan (1.052) 
the Options:Configuration:Emulation choices are:

  DEC-VT100
  DEC-VT52
  ANSI

Does anyone know how to deal with this or have suggestions for a better

Did you add imap to /etc/services and /etc/inetd.conf then restart inetd
on the server?  A very basic test to see if imapd is properly configured
is to telnet to the IMAP port (143) on the server.  If you get a one-line
banner, it is working...

I'vbe been struggling with the same problem, and I have a couple of 
questions about what you say here.

First, in the second cireteria for triggering the MIME translation 
routine It seems you left our a word...  "at least one Very Long..."  
what?  I think you mean a very long *line* but I'm not sure...

Also, I have a question about the which characters will trigger the MIME 
translation routines.  You seem to be saying that any character code less 
than ASCII 32 will trigger it, but aren't newline characters ASCII 13, 
and tab characters 9?  If these characters trigger "Quoted Printable" 
wouldn't every message that is more than one line long be translated this 
way?

Thanks for you help,

Mike MacKenzie

It's still there.  I composed that reply "on the hoof" and had
forgotten this possibility - sorry.  As a matter of fact, I got all
kinds of strange results when I tried it, but as Yehavi recommended
the other method, I built the software with the Multinet option and
made no attempt to find the cause of the problems with VMSMail
"foreign protocol" method of operation.

Thanks for pointing out my oversight (which would, I suppose, have
become clear if the questioner had read my html page and started to
install the package.  Fortunately, fetching an unwanted copy of
some free software isn't _too_ harmful  ;-)
And for posting your experiences.  I do recommend running the current
version, there are some nice enhancements, but I should mention that
if and when you decide to make the transition yourself, you will need
to make some manual adjustments in your configuration.  Again this is
mentioned in my web file.

We just finished a workshop here and the participants
want a way of posting mail to an address on this machine
(tioga.upb.pitt.edu) that broadcasts the mail to all the
participants. I created a mailing list for my uses in
contacting people, but how can that be used to redirect
mail to 24 addresses or so?

Thx in advance

Pine is great!

Someday, it would be even greater if filename completion (i.e., ESC-ESC)
were added for Saving to or Reading from a file.

In case I'm not making myself clear... I'm talking about the standard sort
of Unix shell feature where you where wanting to do
	rm ~/temp_stuff/document.v50a
you could use automatic completion to specify the sub-directory temp_stuff and 
then again to specify document.v50a by typing enough characters to identify
the string you meant and pressing ESC-ESC.

Hi,

I'm on a high noise to signal list, and have invoked the digest option.  
I'd like to extract the one or two sections of the long digest message 
and save, but haven't been able to accomplish this yet.

I use Pine with a Unix shell account.  I'm aware of the ctrl-k for 
cutting, and the other basic commands, but can't seem to save to a 
different file after finding the section of the digest article that I want.

BTW, is there a command for jumping to the end of an article while 
reading Pine?  I guess the actual text processing is done via Pico, 
but I haven't been able to find anything better than jumping one 
screen up or back.

Thanks for any help,

Alan

Assuming that when you say "I created a mailing list for my users" you're 
talking about a list entry in Pine's address book...

The answer is "you probably can't".  The reason is that Pine's address
book "list" feature should be thought of more as a "personal distribution
list" rather than a "mailing list".

In particular if this is defined in your personal address book then it is 
only you who can use it (via its nickname) when composing a message.

You can set up a "global address book" which is in effect a centrally 
held read-only address book that can be used by people on the same 
machine running Pine.  Indeed this _may_ be what you're after doing.

However if you are hoping for a way of your users sending a message to a 
"special" e-mail address and then have this remailed out to the list 
members automatically then Pine does not (cannot) do this.

This is because Pine is a Mail User Agent (MUA).  This is a fancy name 
for saying it lets you read through messages that have *already* been 
delivered into your mailbox file.  The thing that actually delivers the 
messages there is called a Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) and is usually a 
system program such as "sendmail".

It is the task of the MTA to decide what to do with an arriving message: 
whether it is simply to be delivered into the user's mailbox, or 
processed in some other way (eg, remailed to a list of people).  This is 
typically achieved by using the MTA's redirection facility ("sendmail" 
uses a file called ".forward" in your home directory) to send the 
arriving message through special software to process/recognise the 
message and handle.redistribute it appropriately.

An example of a software package to do this analysis is "procmail".

So the sequence becomes:

	User sends message to special username
	MTA prepares to deliver to special username, buts spots redirection
	Message is redirected into (eg) procmail for handling
	Procmail remails the message to a list of people

Note that this is fine if the list of people is to be centrally 
maintained by a human (they'll need to modify/update the procmail control 
file for the special username).

If you're after something that can handle a list and allow people to 
subscribe or unsubscribe from the list (semi-)automatically by sending 
e-mailed commands then you need to be looking at running some list 
serving software instead of using procmail.  Examples include "listserv" 
and "majordomo".

Hope this helps a bit.

Yup... it should have read:

I was trying to be a little vague as I'v never quite ascertained which 
control characters (ASCII codes less than 32) are "acceptable" (ie, don't 
trigger Quoted Printable) in isolation.

More specifically:

*  You're safe with ASCII characters 32-126

*  You *might* be safe (I don't know: experiment! :-) with ASCII character 
   127 (it's unusual, but not an 8th bit set character code)

*  You *are* safe with certain (all?) characters with ASCII codes less 
   than 32.

So the presence of a Tab (ASCII code 9 (decimal)) does not trigger Quoted 
Printable, for example.

However, *once triggered* by some other condition Quoted Printable *does* 
then protect these usually-acceptable characters.  So if a message is 
encoded in Quoted Printable because, say, an 8th bit set character is 
present, then Tabs *do* get Quoted.

I find it very strange that an "acceptable" character suddenly is deemed 
"unacceptable" because of the presence of some other character elsewhere.

Whether this anomaly lies in the specification of Quoted Printable within 
MIME, or within Pine's implementation of it I don't know.  (I suspect the 
former, as the Pine Team are pretty hot on sticking to specifications as 
a rule -- anyone "in the know" care to comment?)

Yes, I agree....  Completion is there for folder names (press Tab to 
complete a name, providing you have the appropriate feature turned on in 
the Setup Configuration screen).  However it doesn't seem to work for 
filenames (saving, including text, attaching files).

Is this one for the Pine Team to consider?

Whenever I send message that include text imported from an ASCII file
(edited by 'pico'), I see it ok on screen but most of the people who
receive such message, get it garbled with '=20' at the end of lines.

Another problem:
Sometimes after running the 'spell' process, attempting to 'perform take
address' on more than 50 addresses, Pine terminates stating there is a bug.
Why does this happen and how can I get back without loosing
what I was working on.

Please reply directly to my account.

hello,
	I have just downloaded a copy of pine 3.91 and a couple of points 
	come up after reading the tech notes. Perhaps someone could answer 
	these or point me in the direction of the FAQ.

1.	Can pine be used for posting to usenet newsgroups

	the tech notes seem to suggest that it can open netnews folders in 
	read only mode. Or is it that it can only read the posted articles 
	but when you reply it creates a new article. Perhaps someone can 
	elucidate further.

2.	How does Imap work the tech notes do not seem to fully explain how 
	you communicate with it. How does your incoming mail get from 
	sendmail or whatever is used to receive it to imap. Or does imap 
	simply read your unix mailbox when requied and pass these to the 
	pine client.

TIA

best wishes

Tim

Yes, providing you have access to an NNTP server (news server) that you 
are allowed to post articles to without having to supply it with any 
authentication information (username and password).

Pine can use either the IMAP or NNTP protocols to read Usenet News 
articles.  The former only works if your IMAP server has access to the 
filestore holding the Usenet News files and has been properly configured.

The simplest way is to use NNTP.

Start Pine and, at the Main Menu, go into the Setup Configuration screen 
(by typing "S" then "C").  Now move down to the "nntp-server" variable 
and use the Add (A) command to set its value to the full IP name of your 
news server.  This often looks something like "news.blah.blah.blah".  
Leave the Setup Configuration screen using Exit (E), and try doing a List 
Folders (L).  You should see a "News-collection" appears.

Move the cursor down to this and subscribe to some newsgroups using the 
Subscribe (A) command.

Note that using NNTP in this way to read news keeps the list of 
subscribed newsgroups and read articles (usually in a file called 
".newsrc" for UNIX) on the computer you're running Pine on.  The 
advantage of reading Usenet News via IMAP is that the IMAP server itself 
maintains the ".newsrc" file, so you get to see the same lists of 
subscribed newsgroups and read articles no matter which machine you are 
reading from.

Sendmail delivers arriving messages into your usualy mailbox entirely 
normally.  The IMAP daemon then gives you access to this mailbox (and any 
other mail folders you create).  There is no direct communication between 
sendmail and the IMAP daemon.

You can find more information, and the FAQ, about Pine at the Pine 
Information Centre on the World-Wide Web:

I find it confusing that in sending a binary (say /bin/echo) to myself,
pine encodes it as Application/octet-stream; yet when I get the message, 
it claims to know nothing about such a format!!! - I can't decode it!

Please, also, could some dear pine user send me a copy of their mailcap file.

Thanks indeedy.

Is there any freeware or shareware that can convert mail format from
MS-MAIL or from Pegasus Mail to Eudora mail format automatically ?

Please help me where can I find it.

Thank's.

Pine offers a very useful collection of commands referred to as 
"aggregate commands".  Before you can use any of them you need to go to 
the Setup Configuration screen and select the 
"enable-aggregate-command-set" feature.

Having done this you will have the following new command available when 
in the Index of your messages:

	;  Select - Selects messages according to a criterion.
		    (Can narrow (AND) or widen (OR) the list of selected
		    messages by using Select again followed by Narrow or
		    Widen respectively.)
	Z  Zoom   - Restrict the index to just the selected messages; other
		    messages are hidden.  Another Z will restore the full list
	A  Apply  - Applies a command to all the selected messages.

Thus to print all your messages:

	;	Select
	A	All messages
	A	Apply
	Y	Print command

This feature can also be used when reading Usenet News to "catch-up" in a
newsgroup by selecting all the articles then applying a delete to them: 

	;AAD

One good application that I'm aware of is called MailDrop.  I believe
the current version is 1.1.  I don't recall where I got it from (some
FTP site out there), but it shouldn't be too hard to find.  It works
fairly well.  The only problem I had was entering my password.  For some
reason it didn't like mine, but it would accept everyone else's.  I
finally found out that I was a little too anal about adding non-alphanum
characters and MailDrop didn't want to work with a space in my password.
Unlike PINE and the same password on a UNIX system which did work.

Richard,
	Your address file is an ascii text file and can be edited with 
vi, pico or even exported to a word processsing program and then 
re-imported.  If you have a list also in ascii, you could edit it to 
match the addressbook's style and then retrieve it into your address file 
as additional text.  You will want to look at the current address file 
format first.  Hope this helps.
Colleen

Assuming you are using the UNIX version of Pine...

Simply use your favourite editor to create a file called ".signature" in 
your home directory.  Put in this file any text you want included at the 
end of each message you send.  General advice is to keep it 4 lines long 
or less.

a single file useable as a pine directory.

The FAQ is strangely quiet on converting from other mail systems.

I just wanted to mention one of the easiest ways to do this, if you are
the sys. mgr. or know the sys. mgr.  Sendmail also has a central aliases
file that can be used for this.  You can just put an entry in the aliases
file that looks like:

listname:  user1, user2, ...

and it will get redistributed.

Pine will encode if there are any characters with the 8th bit set, any
null characters, or any lines of 1000 characters or more.  It doesn't
encode because of a character in the range 1-127.  The long line limit
comes from a limit in the SMTP spec.  Also, you can't send 8 bit
characters over standard SMTP, so that's where that comes from.  (ESMTP
will be supported in 3.92.) Like Mike says, once the decision to encode
has been made, then more characters get encoded.  The rules for what gets
encoded all come from RFC1521.  (In 3.92 we'll eliminate trailing spaces
from lines of composed text so that will get rid of the annoying =20's at
the ends of lines.)  We're pretty much encoding only when required, except
for attachments, which we always encode for robustness.

Whenever I send message that include text imported from an ASCII file
(edited by 'pico'), I see it ok on screen but most of the people who
receive such message, get it garbled with '=20' at the end of lines.

Another problem:
Sometimes after running the 'spell' process, attempting to 'perform take
address' on more than 50 addresses, Pine terminates stating there is a bug.
Why does this happen and how can I get back without loosing
what I was working on.

Please reply directly to my account.

Has anyone else tried the version Yehavi has out there now? 
I got pine_3_91_beta_5.zip but Alan's web pages discusses beta_3...

So far have been unable to get it to work. It works through the 
pico compile fine but chokes on vms_mail.c

VAX 6000-420, VAX/VMS V6.1, MultiNet V3.4A, DECC$COMPILER C V4.0-000

Basically, what I did was copy 

    [.pine3_91.c-client]ctype.h to sys$library:ctype.h
and
    [.contrib.vms]vmsbuild.com to [.pine3_91]vmsbuild.com
then 
    @vmsbuild.com multinet

It dies with this as the last message


    %VCG-I-SUMMARY, Completed with 1 error(s), 19 warning(s), and
                    26 informational messages.
                    At line number 2392 in [.PINE3_91.C-CLIENT]VMS_

And this error.

              if(strcmp(stream->mailbox, "INBOX") == NULL)
            .....^

    may not be compared for equality or inequality.
        At line number 1406 in [.PINE3_91.C-CLIENT]VMS_MAIL.C;1.

Any ideas here?

Did I overlook discussion on this or is this a new error?

I and my co-workers are coming off of a CMS system where, if anyone is familiar
with it, we have something called a "names file" which is where nicknames are
stored, email address, and a name, much like the .addressbook for pine.

We are wondering now if there exists such a program that will translate our	old crummy names file to the lean and mean pine addressbook format.

Here is an excerpt of part in the names file:

:nick.MJM      :userid.U29263   :node.uicvm     
               :name.Michael Maggio             

And this would be translated to:

MJM<tab>Maggio, Michael<tab>u29263@uicvm

I am sure if we were spared the expense of retyping 150 names we can simply
edit the hostname if they're outside our domain...

If anyone has information, either email me or post back to the group.

Thank you very much in advance!

Sam,
Decoding is not the problem... Pine can decode anything it encodes (or
presumably any Base-64 MIME message): Just use the Save command in
the View Attachment screen.

But decoding is different than *displaying* (or in the case of an
executable being sent, "automatically invoking").  Pine does not have any
idea how to *display* an application/octet-stream object, and most
mailcaps don't define that type since it is a catch-all, and as such the
type doesn't convey anything about what should be done with it.

So there are a couple of distinct pieces to MIME: one is robust transport
of non-ascii data, which is handled by the encoding, and the other is
labelling data so that the recipient can (sometimes) automate the handling
of the data object, e.g. starting up "xv" to display a GIF file.  You
should always be able to Save an attachment and get the same byte stream
the originator sent, but if the attachment is not specifically labelled
(and the current version of Pine is very limited in its labelling ability)
then you'll have to save the attachment and manually invoke the
appropriate viewer.  In the case of an executable object, it's often a
good idea to make the invocation manual anyway...

    Try invoking Pine as:   pine -l -Il,i

My communications software lets me set up this keystroke sequence on 
a "hot key."  (With some software packages you may have to specify a 
<return>, usually encoded as something like ^M, at the end of the 
invocation sequence.)  In the above, -l tells Pine to expand the folder 
lists, and -Il,i is the initial keystroke list to be executed 
automatically from the Main Menu.  It is actually quite flexible.

I have a copy of Pine 3.91 installed on an RS6000 590 under AIX 3.2.5.
I have tried everything to get pine to run utilizing function keys as
in pine -k.  When I do so, using vt100 terminal emulation, function
keys F5 and above do not work.  I have modified the termcap in 
/etc/termcap and put a copy in /usr/local/lib just in case pine was 
looking there.  I've modified the termcap file and have the function 
keys in vt100 emulation working perfectly in other programs.  The 
TERMCAP and TERM environment variables have been set correctly in the
.profile, but no luck.  Lastly, even if I set the TERMCAP to null or to
a bogus file name (like /fred), pine seems to find some terminal 
emulation to use.

We are so close, but not quite there and it is driving us nuts!

If anyone has a clue, please send me email at mikean@iquest.net.

Another approach is to hit ^J^T and use the curses based directory
browser to select the file. Beware though, currently Pine only has
support for a few types of media types (gif, jpg, PostScript, tiff,
...) but doesn't have the ability to add others (e.g. .rgb files). The
next release of Pine should fix this however.

There are man pages that came with procmail for constructing recipies
try "man procmailex" for some.

    Here is a response I made to someone else on the same thing.  It's 
pretty frequently asked.  You can easily find out whether you have 
procmail.  Just enter:  procmail -v        If you have it on your system, 
procmail with answer back with some version information.  (I believe 
version 3.10 or 3.11 is the latest.)  Procmail is actually very powerful, 
and I do not begin to use all its capabilities.  However, just setting it 
up to direct incoming mail this way and that into separate folders I 
found to be quite simple.

    The instructions are not such that I can just pop them into an email. 
There's a little more to it than that.  First, you have to have available
software which will do the filtering! -- and there is more than one such
beast.  Probably your best bet is to get Nancy McGough's Mail Filtering
FAQ: 

URL= 
http://www/cis/ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/mail/filtering-faq/faq.html

URL= ftp://ftp.halcyon.com/pub/ii/internet/filtering_mail_faq.txt

URL= ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/mail/filtering-faq

or send email to:
    mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu
with message:
    send usenet/news.answers/mail/filtering-faq

There are fairly complete instructions in the FAQ for setting up simple
mail filtering.  I used the instructions for procmail and had no problems
at all.  If you have procmail on your system and choose to use it, the man
pages may also be of some help, although they are a little more obscure: 

    man procmail
    man procmailrc
    man procmailex  <---- useful
    man procmailsc  (more of theoretical interest).

Does anyone offer a commercially supported IMAP v4 server?  We would
like to start using IMAP, and have client support on the way, but need
a vendor for the server.  And before anyone mentions the UWash or CMU
servers, I am aware of their existance, but need someone to support
the code for both practical and political reasons.

HI,
I wonder if someone could help me.

I've been using Pine 3.91 (on a shell acount) now for a while 
but I haven't been able to configure it for/turn on the MIME option. 
I live in Sweden and when writing in swedish some characters of the 
"Latin1 codepage" (ASCII codes 142, 143 & 153) aren't always transferred 
correctly. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I've been told 
that there should not be any problem in the transfer (i.e. all characters 
will come out as they should on the other end) if both sender and receiver 
has the MIME handling option turned on in their mail software. 

People I have corresponded with tell me that the MIME encoding headers
that should be present in the header of a message are not there.

So, how do I turn on the MIME option in Pine?

I've been checking on-line help in Pine as well as the Pine site at 
http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine but I can't find (identify) the relevant 
information.

Can someone tell me what to do, please?

Also, how do I set Pine to use the ISO-8859-1 instead of US-ASCII. In Setup-
Config I've typed in iso-8859-1 on hte fourth screen at "Character set", but
in the headers of my messages it still says US-ASCII. What do I do wrong?


/Peter

Just obtained a new printer for my system here and need to find out what I 
have to to to configure pine to recognize it and utilize it.  I'm using Pine 
under LINUX (naturally....what else IS there).  Haven't had a printer here 
since LONNNNGGGG before I started using LINUX so I haven't worried too much 
about it.

Anyway, now I got one.  It's a Hewlett Packard DeskJet 540.  I've tried 
using all three options in the print setup part of the Pine configuration 
with no luck.  Of the three option, only one of them comes close.  What *IT* 
does is print the first three lines of the message header in a tab-stepped 
format across the page and then nothing else.

Anybody have any knowledge or experience using this printer with Pine?

We just took delivery of a pair of RS/6000 model 250 machines.
We installed IMAP as indicated in the Pine Technical Notes and
as we have already done with an RS/6000 model 25T in February
and an N40 3 weeks ago. In all cases, we sent a kill -HUP 
message to inetd and when that produced no results we rebooted.

On the model 250, clients receive a "cannot connect to port 143" 
message. However, when we start inetd as root (a second copy)
IMAP begins accepting connections.

All four machines reply with 3250 to an oslevel command.

The new machines are intended to be used as IMAP servers. There
will be no logins except for staff. Would it make sense to put
IMAP in /etc/rc/local?

Suggestions are welcome.
Thank you

This is a bug in imap-3.6.BETA (and imap-4.ALPHA) which was fixed just
before I went on vacation (and I just got back).  I apologize for the
problem, but that's why we call them BETA and ALPHA.

Normally, the BETA version does not have such bad bugs (the ALPHA version
is much more likely).  This is the first bad bug of this magnitude in over
a year.

The bug was caused by an attempt to handle certain systems which report
over quota or disk full conditions by doing partial writes instead of
returning an error from the write.  My Unix box always returns an error
(and the man page documents this), so I was unaware that some Unix systems
do the other thing until recently.

Once again, it's all fixed now, so please get new sources.

Subject: help needed with imapd 3.6BETA on Solaris 2.4

Hello,

we compiled imapd 3.6 BETA on a sun with solaris 2.4.

It is possible to read the mailbox. But when the mailbox (/var/mail/user)
on the server has to be written to disk after usage the mailbox content
gets garbled.

We believe that the Problem is in the routine
bezerk_write_message in the file c-client/bezerk.c.
We believe that the writev systemcall causes the problem.

We get the following messages:

Jul 11 10:24:23 harry imapd[17064]: Retrying after disk error user=testuser
host=arielle.Informatik.RWTH-Aachen.DE mbx=/var/mail/testuser: Invalid argument

Is this a known problem? Are there bug-fixes, workarounds or patches?

Sincerely,

Guido Bunsen

This is a suggestion, not gospel, so it may not work (but I think it 
probably will)...

The Pine and IMAP daemon programs make use of a library of subroutines 
for dealing with access to mailboxes in various formats.  Collectively 
this suite of subroutines is called the "C-Client" code, and is included 
with the Pine distribution kit (after building Pine look in the directory 
pointed to by the symbolic link "c-client" in the main Pine kit directory).

Anyway, the Pine team have provided a set of utilities that use the 
c-client code to convert or copy between different mailbox formats.  
Indeed some of these tools don't even need direct access to the mailbox 
file, but can work over IMAP.

You can get them using anonymous ftp:

	ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap-utils.tar.Z

(Remember to use binary mode when transferring the file!)

I have this mysterious problem with PINE 3.91, I am the system
administrator at my company, and some times when I am checking the system
processes I find some running with no NAME, I go to the owner of the
process to check it up I find out he is running PINE !! 
What should I do about that ?

Or even easier ...

goto setup / config and edit the option initial-keystroke-list:

initial-keystroke-list = i

This displays the index of the default mail folder whenever you start 
pine.

Steve,
The syntax of your inbox-path variable is incorrect.

Instead of:

 inbox-path=netcom.netcom.com inbox

It should be something like:

 inbox-path={netcom.netcom.com}inbox

hello-

I am using pine on a vms system and in my pine.pinerc have set up:

default-fcc="SENT"

so every message  I sent out gets saved in SENT folder. however when
I view this folder every message says: To: ME etc...
so in order to determine which message i sent to a particular person
I would have to read every message in the SENT folder, isn't there
a way around this? why would it save it as To: ME?

thanks very much

joel

We continue to have a problems when using the Pine software for various 
users. They keep receiving the following message:

       Bug in Pine detected "rec'd abort signal"
       exiting Pine
       attempting to save debug file to /usr/garnet/pine crash

We then hit any key to continue.
When we try to use Pine for this user again it cannot open their INBOX.
It locks them up in our computer and we then have to kill the process 
using the root directory command.
Any solutions on how to correct this problem?

Any ideas on this?  Does anyone have a SCO Unix binary that I could get
a copy of?

Steve,
The "technicality" appears to be that Netcom has chosen not to run an IMAP
daemon.  (Pegaus and Eudora use POP, Pine uses IMAP).  If Netcom claims
there is a *technical* reason for not running an imapd alongside their
popd, I'd be interested in hearing it.

Sorry to bother you folks with such a newbie type problem, but
this has been considerable trouble for us.

We would like to be able to print locally, using the Y command
to print.  Since a lot of our folks are still using dumb terminals
with printer attached to the serial port in the back, I've written
a little shell script that: 1) passes a code to the terminal re-
directing all input to the (printer) serial port, then, 2) "cat"s
the input (cat $1  in unix), and then 3) echos a code which then
restores the terminal screen for input (and therefore ends transparent
print mode).

This works fine as a shell script, but when I set it up in printer
setup, Pine seems to be adding unprintable characters before each
line,l nicely  screwing up the printer.  I know these characters are
generated by Pine, because if I export the document, then apply my
shell script, it goes nicely to the printer.  So  the characters are
produced by the Y function, print.

Can anyone tell me what those characters are and how to remove them?
I have the feeling that this is a real comman problem and that many
others have had the same problem.  So what's the solution?

With many thanks in advance for your time and trouble.

Best,
Robert Salasin

Dear Netters:

	How do you read news from Pine ?  I need to do this as some newsgroup
I want is not accessible to my university account.  However I have an account
from a public provider which does offer such group.  Is there a way to 
configure pine so that it extract news from this public provider and pump it
to my university account ?  I don't want to use the public provider because
their phone line is always busy.

Thanks in advance,

No matter how I start the pine it opens the Program Manager 
when I Exit/Quit pine. (I always run with the Program Manager

of course)).

What can change so that Pine doesn't do that, and why is it that
pine does it ??

Pine 3.91, as distributed, _always_ uses MIME.  Any occurance of a
character with an ASCII value of 128 or above will trigger MIME
Quoted-Printable encoding.  Pine will only label a message as ISO-8859-1
if it includes characters outside of 7bit US-ASCII.

Some possible sources of your problem could be that your terminal is not
capable of sending the extended characters, the Mail Transport on your
system is stripping the encpoding somehow, or you have a hacked version of
Pine that has Quoted-Printable encoding disabled...

I like and use Mail Drop, and the author, Carl Bell, is very receptive to
comments and bug reports.

See 
	http://ackmo.baylor.edu/files/Mail_Drop/info.html
and/or
	ftp://ackmo.baylor.edu./pub/bell/Mail_Drop

I think the password problem is due to the imapd, it takes one argument for
the password command, and unfortunately, a space makes it think there is two.
Maybe pine (are you running it as a imap client, or as /var/spool/mail
reader?) passes the arguments properly (within quotes?) to handle spaces. 
Popper and pop3d also show the same behavior, so you may need to adjust
your passwords to omit spaces when/if you are using imap and/or pop.

Nope, nobody has cause PC Pine needs IMAP daemon and Netcom has only the POP
daemon. Now I know as much about what daemon is as I know how many angels can
dance on the head of a pin (half the number of daemons that can - arf arf!), but
for whatever reason, Netcom chooses not to have the IMAP. 

Hey, who says they can't? Must be a reason for it, and I kind of believe that
the service here is pretty good, so I will do Unix and QVTNet.

  I thought I read in this group a while ago a reply to someone in a sim-

article!  Please e-mail me as I don't read the news as much as I used to,

We want to convert to pine. We have it installed and it's working 
beautifully. The problem is that the ones that used emacs's RMAIL tool 
need to stop the mail from going to that file (now, when pine is working, 
the mail goes to RMAIL *and* the pine files).

This problem probably seems trivial to someone out there...

This is a file into which you can put system-wide settings which then are 
used, and cannot be over-ridden, by users.  The standard place for this 
file is "/usr/local/lib/pine.conf.fixed" on UNIX versions of Pine.

Depending on whether you are just trying to limit *posting* news articles 
or also *reading* news articles you will need to have either one or two 
settings present in the fixed configuration file:

nntp-server
-----------
This variable can set up to point to an NNTP (News) server.  By setting 
it a user can both read and (if the news server permits it) post News 
articles.  If you want to stop people posting you will need to force this 
to be an empty value.

news-collections
----------------
It is also possible to specify an NNTP server in the list of news
collections.  (Indeed it is also possible to read News over IMAP if the
IMAP server provides the service.) This is done by having a collection
defined along these lines:
	News {news.blah.blah.blah/nntp}[]	...for NNTP protocol
or	News *[]				...for IMAP protocol
Thus you will have to force this variable to be an empty value too if you 
want to prevent news *reading* (this variable does not enable posting).


Note that the values in the "fixed" configuration file are system-wide.  
Or, more accurately, referenced by all copies of Pine compiled to use 
that particular file for fixed settings.  This means if you want some 
instances of Pine to be fully configurable by users, and some to be 
restricted so they can read and/or post News then you will need to 
compile up separate versions of Pine (each using a different file for the 
"fixed" settings) and use one version for each class of people 
(remembering to prevent access to the other version, of course!).

Your question is actually mixing up to quite different underlying types 
of message: e-mail and Usenet News.  These work and are handled in 
different ways "down below", but are presented to you the user in as 
similar a way as possible.

Here's an attempt to answer...


E-mail
------
When e-mail messages arrive they are delivered to (written into) a file 
that is personal to you; no-one else (normally!) has access to it.  Each 
e-mail message has some status information (called the "header") saved 
along with the actual text itself.  For example, with one of the most 
common UNIX mailbox formats (the "Berkeley" format) whether or not a 
message has been read, marked for deletion, etc is recorded in a header 
line called "Status:".

E-mail messages stay in your mail folder until:
	*  You mark them for deletion ("Status:" becomes "D"), and
	*  You expunge your mailbox (all "Status: D" messages get removed)

The normal situation for e-mail is *not* to delete them until you have 
"finished with them", and expunge them soon after.


Usenet News
-----------
Usenet News articles are *not* delivered to a personal file just for 
you.  Typically there are several hundred megabytes of News arriving 
daily, so you *really* wouldn't want copies of all that arriving and 
being held separately for each user!

Instead articles are held centrally on a server computer.  These are then 
accessed by mail reading programs in some way, often using the "NNTP" 
protocol.

News reading programs -- be it Pine, Tin, etc -- keep a file (often called
".newsrc" on UNIX) listing the newsgroups you have subscribed to.  This
allows them to show you just these groups without all the other
"uninteresting" newsgroups listed as well.  Naturally you can subsequently
add to or remove groups from this list. 

The .newsrc file also lists, for each subscribed group, the numbers of 
the articles that you have seen/finished with.  This lets the news 
reading program show only the other, new, articles and hide those you 
have already read and finished with.  You can override this if you wish 
to see the complete list again.

The format of the .newsrc file is very limiting: an article's identifying 
number is either listed in it (it's read and finished with) or not.  So 
it can only record these two states.

Conventional news readers work with these two states.  They mark an
article as "seen" (add it to the list of read articles in the .newsrc
file) as soon as you have read it.  This happens whether or not you want 
to keep the article around to refer to a little later.

Pine attempts to adopt an approach more akin to e-mail.  Specifically it 
keeps articles listed until you *explicitly* say you have finished with 
them by using the "D" command to "Delete" them (but see the note below on 
article lifetimes).  Only this actually records the article as "finished 
with" by adding its identifying number to your .newsrc file.  When you 
subsequently read the newsgroup in Pine the deleted articles will not be 
listed.

Remember, however, that Usenet News is a *shared* collection of articles 
held on a server machine.  It wouldn't make sense to allow you, for 
example, to actually *delete* an article on the server as someone else 
may still want to read it.  So you "deleting" a Usenet News article 
merely updates your .newsrc file and doesn't affect the news server in 
any way.

This means that in Pine, just as with a conventional news reader, you can
see the full list of available articles (including those you have
"deleted").  You do this by using the "&" (Unexclude) command.

Indeed, in keeping with this the "X" command (usually "eXpunge") is renamed 
"eXclude" to try and indicate that its effect it reversible.  Thus an "X" 
simply *excludes* deleted News articles from the list; you can get them 
back with an "&" command.

The normal way of reading news with Pine is:
	*  Read an article
	*  If you have finished with the article delete it by typing "D",
	   otherwise just move on to another article (the one you were
	   reading will remain in the list)

Some people are surprised when an article they have read but not deleted 
is shown as New again when they next read News using Pine.

Recall that the .newsrc file can only hold two states for each article: 
	*  finished with
	*  not finished with
However Pine uses three states, in keeping with the e-mail paradigm:
	*  finished with (recorded in the .newsrc file)
	*  new (unseen) article
	*  old article (seen but not deleted)

Obviously it is not possible to keep these three states recorded in a 
.newsrc file that can only handle two!  So by default Pine marks all 
undeleted (new and old) articles as New when the newsgroup is next read.  

However Pine also offers a feature that can be turned on that attempts to 
"guess" which "not finished with" articles are new and which are old 
(seen).  You enable this in the Setup Configuration screen by setting the 
"news-approximates-new-status" feature.

What this does is look for the deleted article with the greatest 
identifying number.  It then *assumes* that all undeleted articles with 
smaller identifying numbers have already been read (because they were 
around when you deleted the one with the higher number) and lists them as 
"seen".  Articles with higher numbers are then *assumed* to be new, and 
marked as such with an "N" status.

This works pretty well, but gets confused if you skip articles but delete 
later ones (unseen articles erroneously get marked as seen), or you read 
articles after the last deleted one (seen articles get marked as new).

However on the whole it works pretty well, certainly enough to be very 
useful and worth turning on.


Article Lifetimes
-----------------
A final note about article lifetimes.  Don't assume that just because you 
don't delete a News article it will remain available.  Remember that the 
news server doesn't know whether or not you have "finished with" 
(deleted) an article.  After a certain period of time depending on how it 
is configured the news server will delete articles that have been around 
for a while.

So if you definitely want to keep a copy of an article either print it 
out or save it to another folder (just as if it was an ordinary e-mail 
message).

Hope this helps... (must go and rest my fingers now! :-)

That is an error in the program.
Change the "NULL" to "0",
  eg: if(strcmp(stream->mailbox, "INBOX") == 0)

Hope that solves your problem !

Does anyone know if it is possible to turn of the "feature" of Pine where
it writes your "From" address as "user@host" instead of just "user" as
most mail programs do? 

The reason I ask is because I'm trying to use Sendmail and its UserDB
option to alter the from address for all the users of my machine.  The
UserDB option works fine with every other mail program (such as elm) since
they write their "From" lines as "From: user".  However, pine has a
'feature' of writing the from line as "From: user@host" and the Sendmail
UserDB will not process from lines with the "@host" already appended. 

Is there any simple way to turn this 'feature' off (besides hacking up 
the code)?

I have tried compiling pine with the ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM option, and 
setting my personal "From" line to "From: user", but even this less than 
ideal solution doesn't work.  (Pine still adds the "@host").

Thanks.

The easiest thing to do is to add a "Reply-To:" line in your "Customized 
Headers".  If you truly want to change the "From:" line, you can add a 
"From: email@address" in you Customized Headers.  However, this will only 
over-ride you true "From" address if you rebuild pine with the Flag set 
to allow users to change their "From" line.  By default, this is not 
allowed.  (The flag is ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM and is in 
pine3.91/pine/osdep/os-xxx.h).

I have been dragged kicking and screaming into the world of Pine, because 
Elm is combining messages.  I cannot for the life of me figure out how to 
get Pine to save outgoing messages in the same folder that incoming 
messages get saved to, that is a different folder for each person/mailing 
list to whom/which I send mail.  For instance, I am on the CIRCPLUS 
mailing list, and whenever I send mail to the list from Elm the mail gets 
saved in the file ~/mail/circplus.  Mail to joeblow@nowhere.net goes into 
~/mail/joeblow.  Can Pine do this?  How?

I am using Pine by telnet from a PC. I can't send ^^ or ^_ (and I've tried
using alt-keypad-number-number-number ... doesn't work with this telnet

Is there anything I can do to change the keys for functions in Pine?

  One way I found and am using is to set up aliases and set default fcc=20
in them (according to the the name). But this requires sending mail=20
primarily to the same users.

    As a polite suggestion, please do not do this!  People who come up 
with cute blinking or colored text in their messages imbed special 
control characters.  The only problem is that there is no standard for 
these things, and different terminals and PCs react differently to them.  
What may look cute or eye-catching to one recipient may cause another 
recipient's terminal to go crazy!

    There is a quick-and-dirty workaround by hand.  When you prepare an 
outgoing email or newsgroup posting, put the cursor into the header, on 
the line Fcc: .  Press Ctrl-K to erase what is there and type in the name 
of the folder you want to save the message to.  When you send the 
message, Pine will cheerfully save the message in the folder you 
specified.  I do this all the time.  (By the way, if you clear the Fcc: 
line and put nothing in it, Pine will not save the outgoing message at 
all.)

You can write a small program in dBASE to import the data from the
folders, and store that data into the dBASE file.  You would need to
find out exactly what structure is used in the dBASE file(s) you are
wanting to add records.

Pine does not filter; therefore, contact the person's ISP "postmaster":

		postmaster@offender.net

and make a complaint. 

Worked for me when an AOL a/h threatened to kill me next time he saw me on my
bike. Scary.

I know from user problem reports that the escapes can lock up certain
non-vt terminals, leaving the user with no choice but to turn off the
terminal and avoid reading the message again.  Nice stuff.

Is there a way I can decode Mac BinHex files with Pine on either Solaris 2.4
or Linux?  I have a problem with users sending me mail with Eudora, and they 
alway choose MacBinHex instead of Mime like I tell them to.  

Thank you,

I administrate a et of Unix minis which use sendmail to communicate 
emails between machines.  I believe it is possible to run some sort of 
POP daemon on my major relay host, and enable mailers such as Pegasus and 
Eudora.  Alternatively, I have just read in a note here that PINE users 
IMAP.  
Question:  What's the best USENET source for assistance on setup and 
configuration of these systems?  

Also, is there an agreed "source" for freeware POP or IMAP daemons?  I 
need to compile for System V R4.  Thanks,

The obscure error message ("Append not valid for file") means "You tried
to save a message into a file which is not a valid mail folder file.  All
of the known formats of folder files have been checked, and it is none of
these, so Pine doesn't know how to save a message to that file.  Either
save to a different file, or fix whatever is broken in that file."

This error message will be corrected to something more intelligible in
Pine 3.92.

There is a standalone hexbin/binhex utility for dos or unix.  If you need 
it, I've attached the dos versions to this message.

Save the message run it through hexbin.

Have you tried setting VERBOSE=on and then looking at the LOGFILE?

Subject: rimapd problems with HPUX

I have recently converted to Pine running on my Linux based laptop, but 
my incoming mail arrives at an HPUX workstation.  I have two questions:

1) How should I configure Pine so that my outgoing mail comes from a 
different host (the usernames are the same)?  Can I just change that in 
the Composer or should I set up the smtp server to be the desired machine.

2) I have installed imapd on my HPUX machine and it works well.  I have 
also made the appropriate link to /etc/rimapd.  This does not work so 
well.  From my Linux command line, I can type "rsh _host_ exec 
/etc/rimapd" and it starts something successfully.  I have setup rimap 
servers on other machines with no trouble!  What is different?

Thanks,

    Perhaps I just don't understand your question, then.  It works for me 
just fine.  When I save an outgoing mail in a specific folder, it always 
shows up in the index as  To: whomever-I-sent-it-to .

I'm still evaluating this product, but I have an IMAP2bis server from the folks
at ESys corp in Canada.  They took over what used to be ECSMail and are in the
process of releasing the commercial version (sort of like Qualcomm and Eudora,
I guess).  You can reach them at sales@esys.ca   They will give you the source
for their server or they sell the binaries precompiled for different platforms
with support.

There is another company called Siren Software that sells a commercial version
of an IMAP2 or IMAP2bis server that I am looking at.

  Is there anyone working on a OS/2 port of Pine? There isn't any mention of
one in the sourcecode.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

After a couple of comments, I've updated Pinesign to a new version.  This 
new version adds the ability to choose whether your ascii signature (ie 
$HOME/.signature) is added.  Some mail servers get confused by extra 
text, so the ability to make sure nothing extra is added was requested.

Basically, if you want to sign the message both digitally and asciilly 
(is that a word :-), just press return twice after you exit your composing 
editor.  Otherwise, make the selections you want specific to the type of 
message you are sending.

# PINESIGN v2.0
# Written by:  Robert A. Hayden <hayden@krypton.mankato.msus.edu>

# PINESIGN is a simple program that will allow you to automatically sign 
# your email and news messages composed with the Pine 3.89 mail reader.  It 
# may also work with other mail and news programs, but it has not been 
# tested.

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONFIGURING PINE
# 
# You need to define the following options in Pine.  This can be done 
# either via the SETUP options in the main menu of Pine, or via editing 
# the .pinerc. 
#
# 	A)	signature-file=" "  (an empty space)
#	B)	enable-alternate-editor-cmd
#	C)	enable-alternate-editor-implicitly (optional but recommended)
#	D) 	signature-at-bottom
#	E)	editor=<exact path to this script>

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONFIGURING PINESIGN
#
# The PGP program must be in your path, and the PGPPATH environment 
# variable must be defined.  See the PGP documentation for details.
#
# Double check that the first line of this program points to sh. 
#
# Edit the SIGPATH and PINEEDITOR variables to point at your signature 
# (if any) and the editor you wish to use for your Pine mail.  Default 
# signature will be the file .signature in your $HOME directory.  
# Default editor is pico -z -t.

SIGPATH=$HOME/.signature-pine
PINEEDITOR='pico -z -t'

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING PINESIGN
#
# When you compose a message, you will compose your message as normal.  
#
# When you exit your editor (control-X in Pico), you will receive a prompt 
# asking if you wish to add your signature file to the message.  If you 
# respond with y, Y or just press return, your text signature file (often 
# $HOME/.signature) will be appended to your message.  If you type  
# anything else, your message will not have your signature added.
#
# Next, you will be prompted as to whether you wish to PGP sign your
# message.  If you answer with y, Y or return, you will be prompted for your
# PGP passphrase and then dumped back to the address/subject section of
# Pine.  If you type anything else, your message will not be signed.  
#
# If you selected it to be added, your .signature file will be appended 
# AFTER your digital signature. 
#
# If you have not defined your alternate editor to be run implicitly, you 
# will need to start it manually.  If you do not run the alternate editor,
# your .signature file will not be appended and you will also have to do
# that manually.  It is highly recommended that your define your alternate
# editor to run implicitly. 

### DO NOT EDIT ANYTHING BELOW THIS LINE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING ###

Under our old version of pine, 3.05a, we were able to send attachments
(nothing fancy, just text files) from our RS/6000s (aix 3.2.5) to our
VAXex and Suns and TIs.  We upgraded to pine 3.91, which is really nifty,
but I digress.  Now when we send attachments to our Vaxes, Suns or Tis, the 
receiving machines cannot display the attachment.  The following message 
appears in the mail message:
 
This message is in MIME format.  The first part should be readable text,
while the remaining parts are likely unreadable without MIME-aware tools. 

Furthermore, if the message is forwarded from the receiving non-aix 
machine back to an aix machine, the above message still appears in the 
forwarded mail message, and the attachment cannot be viewed by the aix 
machine any more.

Does anybody know why the other machines see the message as MIME 
formated?  Is the new version sticking some 
super-secret-magic-decoder-ring-type thing in the message?  (neato!)
I don't see any pinerc settings dealing with MIME except where you 
specify an image-viewer.  Didn't see any compile time options relating to 
this either.  Any pearls of wisdom?

Thanks

Jackie,
3.05 is so ancient I had to think for awhile about what it did...  I
believe way-back-then (Summer '92) we didn't yet MIME-encode text
attachments.  The reason we changed to encode all attachments (including
text) was to ensure the integrity of the attached file.  In Internet mail
transport, there can be subtle corruptions of text files which can
sometimes matter (e.g. stripping trailing blanks, tab expansion, escaping
"From " lines, etc), and we felt that anything *attached* should be
delivered without any corruption, even if many times folks aren't so picky
about text files.  That was, after all, a key goal of MIME...

There are two approaches to dealing with this (neither one ideal for folks
who are accustomed to the old behavior):

 o Fix your receiving mailers to be MIME-capable.  (MIME is almost four
   years old now, so it's well past time to do that!)

 o If you want to send text that is *not* MIME-encoded, *include* it in
   the message via ^R, rather than *attaching* the text file.

I suspect the reason the forwarded version of the message doesn't decode
is that it is missing the MIME-Version header, which is essential.
Teaching the recipient mailers to be MIME-aware (e.g. installing the
Metamail package) would also solve this.  There are also stand-alone MIME
encoders/decoders, such as mpack/munpack from CMU...

I had previously used Foxpro to do that with mail log files on a VM/CMS
machine running RICE mail. The program was straightforward since RICE has
a marker line with the number of lines in each message.

Upon moving to a UNIX system, saving messages to a file using the simple
Unix "mail"  left no reasonable marker line to do the same. However, since
my message above, I discovered that Pine does not strip a marker line
between messages saved to a folder. The marker line doesn't have the total
number of lines of the message, so I'll start from there. 

If someone has already written a dbase prg for this, I'd appreciate it.
Presently, I use Foxpro and Access. 

Regards, James Reese

Thank you all for your answers. And the winner is ...

... hit <ESC> twice, then the character!

(i.e. <ESC> <ESC> _ or <ESC> <ESC> ^ )

The second was to reconfigure the telnet program, which isn't feasible
(campus network).

Pine reads mail once it has been delivered.

To redirect mail into different folders you need to intercept the actualyl 
delivery process itself.  This is not done by Pine, but your system's 
mail delivery program.  For example on a lot of UNIX systems this is 
called "sendmail".

Typically you will have to set up a redirection file (often called 
".forward", which lives in your home directory) to send arriving messages 
through a program that will look at the content and decide what to do 
with it (eg, where to file it).

An example of such a program is the "procmail" package.  If not already 
on your computers it can be obtained via anonymous ftp from a number of 
archive sites.

Well, you didn't say which part of PGP you wish to use.  If you just want 
to digitally sign your messages, that's easy.  I even have a script 
available that mostly-automates it (PineSign 2.1).  Write if you want a 
copy. (Note, it's only works on UNIX).

If you want encryption, that gets a lot more hairy.  I've seen some noble 
attempts and near-automated encrypting, but never found anything that 
worked well for me.  I basically encrypt stuff in file space if I need to 
do that, and use Pine for signing only.

Alt.security.pgp added to newsgroups line.

 when I type ls -a -l at the prompt, one of the files listed is:

Then, when I type pico laaa001ca to see what it is, I get a message 
saying  [File has long line]. Then [ Read 539 lines, Long lines wrapped ]
But the text itself is gibberish, full of @, and some ^N ^V etc.
However, it does start off with:

Can anybody tell me what this file is doing?
Thanks,

I had the problem a few weeks ago, but I got the answere, that pine is 
not able to do that. Trz 'vacation' at your system prompt or use elm for 
automatically messaging.

Hello Everyone --

I posted this question a few weeks ago and was told to check the pine 
archives. I have, and couldn't find it.  

I would like to disable the keyboard lock feature of pine. Does anyone 
know how this is done?


Thank you in advance,

Here's the dbase file structure of Delrina's Internet Messenger (IM). IM
logs onto my UNIX account, reads the INBOX and PINE's read-messages
folder, and downloads them to dbase files. However, IM can only direct
dial the UNIX machine, and does not work with my PPP connection. What I
wind up doing is going online via PPP Telnet to the Unix, invoke PINE,
then once a day direct dial using IM to download the PINE folders to dbase
files. 

Since I can write only elementary dbase code, it's beyond me to write a
program which can duplicate what IM does. What would be nice is to have a
prg which could convert the PINE folders after they have been downloaded
to a pc.

Suggestions? James Reese

	Please note that elm itself does not send "vacation notices".  The
elm distribution comes with a routine called "autoreply".  However,
that routine has a security hole and the author has advised against the
use of "autoreply".  

	As you said, the vacation program will produce the desired
results sans security problems.

I found the solution to my own problem, with cues from people who
answered me here and by mail.  I just set "fcc-name-rule" to

Two choices...

Either,

*  Turn it off in the systemwide "fixed configuration" file.

For UNIX systems this defaults to living in
/usr/local/lib/pine.conf.fixed.  Simply set the "feature-list" variable to
include "disable-keyboard-lock-cmd".  We also disable the Update command:

feature-list=disable-keyboard-lock-cmd,
        disable-update-cmd,

Values in the fixed configuration file can't be overriden by users.  (But 
remember to make the file readable by users! :-)

Or,

*  Modify the source code and recompile.

There's a file for your operating system in the pine/osdep/ directory.  
It's called "os-xxx.h", where "xxx" is the code you use when you say 
"build xxx" to compile Pine.  Look in there and uncomment the "#define 
NO_KEYBOARD_LOCK" line.

   We would like to be able to print locally, using the Y command
   to print.  Since a lot of our folks are still using dumb terminals
   with printer attached to the serial port in the back, I've written
   a little shell script that: 1) passes a code to the terminal re-
   directing all input to the (printer) serial port, then, 2) "cat"s
   the input (cat $1  in unix), and then 3) echos a code which then
   restores the terminal screen for input (and therefore ends transparent
   print mode).

This is the basic approach taken by Pine's attached-to-ansi printer
configuration option.  Since you're not using that, I assume that you
require different escape codes.  I further assume you're invoking Pine's
printer option 3: Personally selected print command.

   This works fine as a shell script, but when I set it up in printer
   setup, Pine seems to be adding unprintable characters before each
   line,l nicely  screwing up the printer.  I know these characters are
   generated by Pine, because if I export the document, then apply my
   shell script, it goes nicely to the printer.  So  the characters are
   produced by the Y function, print.

I use a personally selected print command too, without problems.
Perhaps the problem is not Pine's after all.

Can your script handle input from stdin?  I.e. what happens when $1 is
undefined?  Does it work to 'cat myfile | myscript'?

Try the Unix command,

No, this is a bug, er, limitation, in Mail Drop.  What Mail Drop is supposed
to do is use the IMAP "literal" feature when sending a password that contains
"funny" characters, which should include space.  This will be fixed in the
next version.

You Didn't say which version of Pine you are using.  In version
3.91 there is a variable called "fcc-name-rule".  Setting this to
"by-recipient" should do what you want.  It is accessible from the
"Setup Configuration" screen.  Go to M)ain, S)etup, C)onfig.  The
online help says the following:

To get incoming messages saved by "sender" you need to set the
variable "saved-msg-name-rule" to "by-sender".

Hope this helps.

I've got a Sun at home and I connect to the net via ppp.  My provider has a
popper running and I get my mail using Eudora on a Macintosh.  I'd like to
consider some alternatives.  I'd like to use the Sun as a mail host or
something.  I'd prefer to have the Sun grab and hold the mail.  It's not
attached to the net constantly so I can't just use it as a direct SMTP
address.

Right now, the providers Sun holds my mail and delivers it to me via a pop
mail service.  Can I access that with the Sun or is there some better way
to do it?  I've seen the sendmail docs and I'd really rather not attempt
this without some suggestions!

Thanks,

Hi everybody,

I'm using PINE 3.91 on a SPARCstation SLC (Solaris 2.4) and have the 
following problem:

When I attach a binary file the receiving end (Using Sun Mailtool) gets 
the attachment as a plain file, no name of type given. The attachment can 
be saved and (if the receiver knows how) processed.

Does anybody have a clue what I did wrong?

Greeting from (very hot at this time) Hamburg,
 Michael Joswig

Get procmail and the filtering FAQ. I know that you can use this to send
automatic replies, but I'm not certain how one would bounce the mail back
to the sender. I assume the reason is that you don't want to read it. 
However, consider using procmail to shuffle all such messages into a
folder (which you needn't read) and to send back an automatic reply to the
sender saying that all mail from that address is being automatically saved
but ignored AND one to postmater@jerk's.site saying that you have received
another email message from soandso even though you have asked that the
person not send any more mail.

'_always_ uses MIME' is in most cases very fine!

But some sites don't have the MIME-support. 

In this cases it would be good, to get a warning
   ( ----   a new feature   ------- in PINE),
if a character with an ASCII value of 128 or above is typed.

1) on REPLY it is possible to make the warning depending on the
   mail-header(was it a Mail with MIME-support?)

2) depending on the addressbook, putting an address from an
   incomming mail to the addressbook (MIMEFLAG=yes, if the
   Mail was with MIME-support)

Many users know nothing about ASCII values!!!
   Users simply write/read/print mail.

PINE is very good for E-Mail-beginners.

There's no way to tell what the problem is from this information.

How do you know the email didn't get through? Unsuccessful mail usually
results in some sort of error message or bounced mail, which contains
information about what went wrong. Read the failure message and see if
that helps. 

How do you know the email address to which you are trying to send is
valid? Merely responding to the message doesn't always work, since some
email software is incorrectly configured (I recently had the problem of
getting email from a friend at an Air Force base to which I couldn't reply
- his sysop had set up the software so the return address was incorrect). 

If you post a copy of the error message you got (feel free to change the 
email address to x's if you prefer) I'll see if it makes sense to me.

Hi Mike,

...maybe not the best way, but why do you not simply go to your folder 
which the message is in (saved-messages or whatever) an F(orward) it to 
yourself. If you remove your signature, the line 'forwarded message' and 
a little bit of header it will just look like before. 
I know it's not the best, but maybe the easiest way.
BTW if I hear one more ... "Multimedia" I am going to blow him up !

yours,

    Several years ago, when I worked at a US Army installation, I had 
what sounds like a similar problem.  I could send an email from my 
CompuServe account to my Army account, but could not send from my Army 
account back to CompuServe.  It turned out that the difficulty was that 
the software on the Army computer could not resolve the @compuserve.com 
address correctly into the appropriate numeric domain address simply 
because @compuserve.com was not loaded into the address tables.  I do 
not know that this is your case, but you might check with your system 
administrator whether your system can successfully resolve a P.R.C. 
written address into the correct numeric domain address.

Hi

I am trying to understand the structure of Pine Folder Files so as to 
convert from VMS mail to Pine using an awk program that was posted 
earlier.  The program didn't work for me (perhaps reflecting just my own 
ignorance of Pine, Unix, and lots of other things).  In playing around 
trying to do manually what I thought the program was to do (just to 
understand it), some strange things seem to happen.

To illustrate, I used Pico to create the following file and put it in the 
mail directory.

>From clark@io.uwinnipeg.ca
>Subject: test
>Status: RO
>This is  the content of the file.

When I enter Pine and select the test folder, however, what I see is this 
entire thing as the body of the message.  OSF, Pico, or Pine seems to 
have added its own header information, as shown by the following file 
extracted from Pine.

Can anyone explain what is happening here?  Does Pine have information 
about the folders that does not appear as regular text in the folder files?

Take care

1st question:

I need to setup pine to look at a subset of my news list.  When I put a
value into the nntp-server, the news-collections gets filled in with the
nntp name.  I added the subset news group in the [ ] space and when I
restart pine, it says that it is empty, but I know it is not.

2nd question:

I want to find out if you can change the character that Pine uses to precede
each line of text when replying to a message?

Thanks for any assistance.

I don't think that Mailtool is MIME compliant.

Sorry if this has been discussed before, but it isn't in the FAQ:  How 
does one get PINE to compile on Silicon Graphics IRIX systems?  We're 
running System 5 on a 4-processor Onyx machine.  I tried "build sgi" and 
it worked with lots of warnings, until it spat out:

sr/lib64/libtermlib.so.
ld64: FATAL 9: I/O error (-lsun): No such file or directory
cc ERROR:  /usr/lib64/cmplrs/ld64 returned non-zero status 1
*** Error code 1 (bu21)

make: fatal error.


Can anyone tell me what's wrong or how to compile for SGI?  Thanks!

The answer to your question is that you did not write a mail folder file.
Since it was not recognized as a mail folder file, it was treated as raw
data.  The additional header information was pseudo-header, generated from
the attributes of the file.

The Unix mbox format of mail folders requires the date in ctime() format
to appear in the "From " line.  You must have an RFC-822 format Date:,
From:, and To: line.  Note that the format of the Date: in the RFC-822
header is in a different format (not ctime()) from the "From " header
line.  Furthermore, a blank line (completely empty, not even a space) must
separate the RFC-822 header from the body.  So, in your example:
	From clark@io.uwinnipeg.ca
	Subject: test
	Status: RO
	This is  the content of the file.
you should do
	From clark@io.uwinnipeg.ca Wed Jul 19 00:49:33 1995
	Date: Wed, 19 Jul 1995 00:49:33 -0500
	From: clark@io.uwinnipeg.ca
	Subject: test
	To: clark@io.uwinnipeg.ca
	Status: RO

	This is  the content of the file.

At a minimum, you should read RFC-822.  This will not discuss the details
of the internal mbox "From " header (this is a UNIXism and not in RFC-822)
but basically a "From " header is the word "From", a space, a source email
address, and the date in ctime() format.  Do not confuse "From " with the
From: header in RFC-822!

Subject: Compiling Pine/IMAP for an ICL DRS6000 ?

Help! 
At present I run Pine on several HP9000 servers under HP-UX. This was no 
problem as the binaries are freely available.

Unfortunately, I have been asked to set up Pine on an ICL DRS6000 running 
SVR4. I cannot find any compiled code for Pine/IMAP for this 
machine/operating system and when I try to download the source 
pine.3.91.tar.Z I cannot unpack it ( even on my HP9000, where the tar -xvf 
command tells me the tar directory is corrupt ). 

If anyone has any ideas on either running Pine on the ICL or unpacking the 
pine source tar file so I can compile it myself then I would be very 
grateful.

Cheers

Hmm, I've received some MIME-encoded Tools and know that mailtool can 
handle them. There are two lines right before the encoded part telling 
which encoding is used and which name the encoded part has.
I've looked (using vi) in the mailfile and can't see these lines. So I 
really think this is an error in my pine.

still clueless,

What, specifically, did you try?  You should be able to use something like
"*{server/nntp}[comp.*]" to limit the collection to the comp hierarchy...

We are using PC-Pine 3.91 with a SCO UNIX system as server running imapd and
MMDF. 

Wery often it happens that when we will save an e-mail to a folder on the SCO
from the PC-Pine we get the message the folder isn't a correct MMDF folder. 

If we then edit the folder it appears that the ^A^A^A^A before and after
alle or most of the mails in the folder is missing. We then must put in
the ^A^A^A^A by hand if we want to be able to save to that folder from
PC-Pine again. That can be a very big job, if there are very many e-mails
in the folder.

With the SCO-UNIX version of Pine 3.91 we never have that problem.

Is there a fix to SCO imapd or something that solves the problem ? 

Thanks in advance for any help

No idea.  Is the pine.crash file telling you anything especially 
interesting?  You might also build with -g, and go do a stack trace on 
the core file.  Also, are you using sendmail or MMDF?

This second part is actually a file locking problem, most likely.  The
previous instance did not have a chance to remove the locking file for the
mailbox, and the new instance detects the lock file, but can't find a
process to alert that it's taking it.  Pine's solution is to wait
patiently for five minutes for the process to respond, and then remove the
lock file and go on with its life.  The lock file is
/usr/spool/mail/username.lock, which you can remove yourself.  Or just
wait for five minutes until it gives up.

Try the compiled binaries available on ftp.celestial.com (there are two

Or even after editing a file called .signature does not help, try to edit 
the file ".pinerc" in your home directory, there should be two line 
"localsignature" and "remotesignature", set these two line to 
"localsignature=~/.signature" and "remotesignature=~/.signature"

	You are confusing pine with elm.....

	(I could use a line from the movie.....  :-) :-) )

	There is no localsignature or remotesignature parameter in the
pinerc.

Linux comes with a utility called popclient type 'man popclient' 
without the quotes of course.

I use popclient and it puts the mail in my system mailbox.  I
have the .pinerc configured to send to smtp.kaiwan.com 
instead of sendmail and can therefore send mail to anyone
who is not on my system.

pine seems to take the return address (for reply) from the from: 
field of the message. This field is likely to be stuffed by pine
when a mail is sent. The problem is have this

my system (host name agni ) is a node on the mail server (ncore.soft.net)
which is on the internet. agni is not publicly listed, while ncore.soft.net is
So the true address for my system is <user>@ncore.soft.net!agni, while the fully
qualified host name is agni.ncore.soft.net (which is not listed).
When pine generates ( or is it sendmail ?) the from: field it puts the fully qualified
host name e.g raman@agni.ncore.soft.net

How do i ask pine to make it raman@ncore.soft.net!agni ?

Alternatively there is a from field in the beginning of the header, which is
correctly inserted by sendmail. Cant pine use this instead ?
or shouldn't it use the Return-Path: field ?

This will only be true, if charters in the included file have only
ASCII values below 128!!! See the remark of 'David L Miller',in an
article 'Re: help with MIME in Pine' in newsgroup comp.mail.pine.

We run pine successfully on various versions of ICL's DRS/NX, on both
DRS3000 and DRS6000 systems.  If you let me know what you need (V6 vs
V7 etc), I can let you have binaries, or give you the current
distribution

	If you are using pine 3.9X, then look in the configuration.....

	Here is the "help"

        OPTION: User-Domain
 
This value specifies the domain part (right-hand side) of your return
address on outgoing email and is also used as the default domain for email
composed to a local user.  If unset, Unix Pine will obtain the domain from
the system.  Often this value will be set for your whole site by the
system administrator. 
 
If you set this, see also the "quell-user-lookup-in-passwd-file" feature.

	BTW, if you are using "!" addressing for hosts that are connected via
a LAN then you are in serious need of help with your configuration.

	In your makefile.sol add -Dconst= to the CFLAGS.  Also, insure
that you don't have /usr/ucb/lib in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Hallo!

  I've found an interesting bug in pine 3.91. I am running it on HP
9000/720 using hp-UX 8.05. When I specify multiple Folder-collections, the
one before last is an anonymous IMAP collection and the last is empty
(nothing, "" without quotes), then I can find strange thing having pressed
L (List folders). I see the news collection specified as second from end
and then I see non expanded (although I have selected expanded view of
folders) collection with name looking like garbled name of the previos one
(the server name begins with the path information from the previous one
and continue with some garbage). This does not happen if I remove the last
<emty value> folder collection. But I like to have it there because
sometimes I need to add a new collection AFTER the last written there and
this is not possible with the Add command.

               Regards V. S.

P. S.  I think pine is a great program and I am thankful to all from the
development team.

Yes, sorry: I should have said *plain* text (or limited the context of the

Note that it would be a violation of Internet standards to send NON-plain

Hi!

In the Folder Index of some of my mail folders (left behind the Flag 'N'

Who can tell me what the '+' means? I read the Online help but I did not

THX for helping me...

I don't see quite the same behavior, but a NULL folder collection does
seem to have some quirks.  But, Pine 3.92 will have an option to add to
the end of a list, so your work-around will no longer be needed...

I have Yehavi's version of the VMS port running on our VAX systems under 
VMS V6.1.  I built Pine with NETLIB and everything in general is working 
fine.  

However, there are some things we want to get working that I don't have
the background or knowledge to do.  It has been YEARS since I had to do
anything like this (but am having a ball trying).  I have many questions
but will stick to the first 2 or 3 that I have been asked to try and
solve. 

(1) As documented by Yehavi, the "default-fcc" field must be set to "" in 
the configuration field.  We hope someone has or that Yehavi eventually 
will get this functionality in the VMS port.  Anyone done this?

(2) I asked Yehavi about this question, but perhaps this is a better forum
to ask:  I would like for files like .addressbook, .addressbook_lu, and
.signature to live somewhere other than SYS$LOGIN.  I tried modifying
[.PINE]OS.H to redirect df_mail_directory, df_signature_file, and
df_addressbook, but had no success.

(3) When in a newsgroup (such as this one), I delete posts I have read or
are no longer interested in.  But, they always reappear when I go back
into the newsgroup Index (even a few days later).  I understand that Pine
handles news in the mail paradigm where the post is not really deleted,
but is supposed to be "marked" somehow in the .newsrc file so these
deleted posts don't show up in the Index.  However, this does not appear
to be working. 

Any help will be appreciated.

When pine encounters a unencoded text attachment it happily displays
it. When an encoded text attachment is encountered, the attached text
must be viewed using the view attachment command. 

It just happens that one of the mail systems we use includes
signatures as attachments. Because of pine's behaviour I see the
signature without having to resort to view attachment. Unfortunately
because of the text encoding I cannot duplicate the behaviour.

I also don't think that reading a text file in offers the same benefit
as being able to attach a text file. If text files are read in (using
^R) then the recipient has the burden of breaking the attachments into
parts. If files are attachments then the mail reader handles the
segmentation. Now the people without MIME aware clients are going to
lose somewhere, but because I have read in the text, the people with
MIME aware clients lose as well.

So, it would be nice to be able to have unencoded text attachments.

read the README:

In that case, sendmail should not be run as a stand-alone network
listener, but it should be registered in the inetd configuration file.
For example:

    smtp    stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/etc/tcpd /usr/lib/sendmail -bs

You will still need to run one sendmail background process to handle
queued-up outgoing mail. A command like:

    /usr/lib/sendmail -q15m

Hi,
	I'm trying to get Pine v3.91 working and all seems well except for 
the fact that I can't receive mail! What do I need to do to correct this?
	I'm a single user from the home using DIP to access the I-net via
a SLIP acct. Currently running Sendmail 8.6.9 and kernel 1.3.11.
	Sorry that I'm duplicating the 1st msg, since you can't email a 
response.
				TIA,
				Wayne

The '+' means that the message was sent explicitly to you ie; it was no Cc 
to other e-mail addresses or even Blind Carbon Copied to other users.

Is there a program or a way to convert saved mailbox between
Pegasus Mail, Eudora, and mbox format?

We have people changing mail clients every once in a while whenever
a better server or mail reader comes up. (First they had to use
unix elm, then used Mac Popmail, then used Pegasus for netware,
and then now wants to use Eudora).

They'd like to keep their archived messages and read them from
the new mail clients.

Other than individually sending each saved message to a new mail server,
or saving into regular ascii format, are there any mail format
converters?

I don't care which platform (DOS/MSWin, MacOS, unix) it runs, as long
as it does what we want: A stand-alone application that converts
one format/folder to another.

Hi,

Has anyone had any experience with the following problem:

I've got tcp_wrappers_7.1 installed on a SysVr4 Unix machine that is 
running an old version of sendmail (4 or 5 - I am upgrading!) and the 
latest Pine/Imap Mail Utility.

Currently, sendmail runs as a daemon: sendmail -bd -q30m

I want to monitor the acitivity on port 25, so I entered the following 
line in inetd.conf:

smtp stream tcp nowait root /usr/local/etc/tcpd /usr/local/sbin/sendmail.wrap

The program sendmail.wrap does some local things and then executes 
sendmail as: sendmail -bs

So far, so good.
Now, if I telnet to port 25, I get the following recorded in syslog
<22>Jul 21 11:16:35 1995 PAMCO_UX sendmail.wrap[3108]: connect from PAMCO_UX

This is good - as well, internal mail mworks fine as well (within the 
same host).

PROBLEM:
My PC-Pine has stopped working. It connects (from a PC) to its mail files on
Unix via IMAP and that works fine but when it tries to send a message back
it fails. I don't get any record of it connecting to port 25 and I can't
send mail.

Thanks for any help!

Pine misses some messages which Mail can find.  For example, using the
same mailbox which contains 488 messages, Pine sees 483 messages while
Mail sees them all as shown below in (2)&(3).  The last lines of 
messages #483 and first lines of message #484 are

However, if the lines are displayed in octal, null characters are
proceeded "From....." in #484 as shown below(1).  The presence of 
null characters may be the cause for Pine not seeing anything after
that.

VT100 emulation does work with Unix.  When I get my `%' prompt after 
logging in I type: setenv TERM vt100.  I've been doing this for several 
years with no problems.

Good luck.

Go to Setup, Configure, then supply the name of the nntp sserver, which 
is probably somethin like news.xxx.toronto.edu.

Hello, I am new to this newsgroup so it is possible someone

Can I configure Pine to use ispell instead of spell??
I am using  UNIX pine version 3.89.

I have just started using pine as my newsreader when I am online.  I like 
the feel of it, especially since it is my mail reader as well.  I was 
wondering though if it is possible to have Pine tell you how many 
messages are unread in a newsgroup, at least which ones have unread 
articles.

Thanks

Hi Raman,

Got Setup (from Main-menu) and choose config. There is an entry
called "customized-hdrs" Add "Reply-To: raman@ncore.soft.net!agni" or
whatever you need. That's all !!

Ciao,

To all who try to work out tricks, what about the easy way?
I have 8-10 files I use as sigs, depending on who/where I'm writing.
I just read the the appropriate file w/ ^R.

Is that too easy?  :-)

hi. i've just recently got my account, and pine.
i've had experience with netscape and mosiac and ftp but have not 
used pine. so. i'm trying to do this.  i'm calling from my house 
into George Mason University and then accessing pine there.  how do 
you save a message for instance onto my hard drive at home.  also 
when i ftp to nevada.edu for instance and get a file, how do i 
specify it so that it goes to my hard drive or if it goes to my 
folder, how do i specify it to go to a different folder besides 
incoming to let's say, "guitarIN"
 
well thanx.

Hi

I have modified the vmsmail.awk program file that was posted to this group
several weeks ago.  It converts VMS mail files to a format understood by
Pine (and I guess other Unix mail programs).  The changes that I remember
making were:  (a) using /pattern/ to identify <Ctrl>L ($1== didn't seem to
work for me), (b) modifying the From conversion to take into consideration
extra information in this field by including an index variable in the
field identifier (e.g., inclusion of auxiliary name field, hundredths of
seconds in time field), and (c) getting rid of the IN% and quotes from the
name. 

To use the program,
	1. EXTRACT this file as mail.awk or somesuch and edit out all put the 
program lines
	2. "EXTRACT /ALL oldmail.mai" in the Vax mail program; note number 
of messages to check conversion
	3. copy oldmail.mai from Vax to Unix (I used ftp)
	4. type "awk -f mail.awk oldmail.mai > ~/mail/oldmail"
	5. enter Pine and select the oldmail folder.  Index should show 
same number of messages as original, or approximately so.  Should see 
correct date, sender, and subject information.

I've seen a few errors in converting 100s of messages, but nothing major 
that I noticed.  If I've overlooked serious problem or way to improve 
program, I would appreciate hearing about it.  Thanks to the anonymous 
person who first wrote the awk program.

Take care
Jim

Hi

I have users who dialin to my system and uses pine3.89 to read mail.  
Recently, I am having users who encounter the error "Folder invalidated 
error (consult expert)".  I discover that this is due to a hidden 
character in the first position of the user's inbox file.  I uses vi 
editor to delete off this hidden character and the problem is solved.  

How did such hidden (invisible) character get into the user's inbox 
which pine is not able to read ?

Appreciate if reply be mail to me.



Thank you.

Have a nice day.

You don't want to.

The address in this header should be the same as in the Return-Path:
header, since this is where the Return-Path: comes from. 

But, this is a bogus address. If sendmail is creating it, then
senmail is wrong.

Are you trying to get mail to agni, or just to nice.ncore.soft.net?
How is mail supposed to get from nice to agni if the former? UUCP?

If so, you want agni!root@ncore.soft.net. Or maybe root%agni@ncore...
You do NOT want that abomination root@a!b.

It's said Pine has special function like this: the user can create

Is this true? or how can i configure my pine system to do this?

You'll note that VMS Mail itself uses the technique of sending a copy
of the mail to the sender.  They don't try to create a file copy
directly.  I just followed their example, and configured PINE with
a Bcc: to send a copy to myself.

I can only agree with you that it doesn't seem to work.  However,
we were already happy users of the (Madison?) NEWSRDR on VMS,
and saw no advantage in moving to PINE as our newsrdr.  Our interest
in PINE for VMS was specifically in handling incoming MIME-format mail;
but it also has the advantage of working as a mail _client_ that can
run on VMS and read remote mail folders on, for example, unix systems.

Hello People,

   Is there anyone out there that has figured out a nice and easy way to filter
the mail coming in ?  I'm currently subscribed to a number of mailing lists,
and the mails for these I manually route into folders today.  I also posted
here a while ago asking if anyone had figured out a nice and easy way to use
PGP with Pine, this really only applies to outgoing mails.

Cheers,

By default, Pine and mtest first try to open a pre-authenticated rimap
connection to the server.  It sounds like rsh is timing out, then you get
the port 143 connection.  To skip rsh and go straight to port 143, specify
":143" after the host name, e.g. {imapserver:143}INBOX

It there any way to automatically send the username and password in the

Any help would be appreciated.

We have retrieved pine from the internet, and successfully compiled the program

Our problem is this:  We are unable to make the function keys work, and  our

The function keys work in various curses applications,
but are not working in Pine.  

Ex:  TERMINFO Function key 01 = \E[19~   Pine gets the escape and the left
bracket, but the rest is sent to the screen.

Any suggestions or assistance would be greatly appreciated.

You can't have an mbox format folder open simultaneously read/write by
multiple users.

What happens is that when Pine detects that the folder's size has changed,
but that the new size is either smaller than before, or is larger but the
new data doesn't immediately begin with a start-of-message header.  That
means that something other than that particular Pine process or sendmail
rewrote the folder.  Pine has no idea what that other program (even
another Pine) did; it no longer knows where the messages are.

Pine is supposed to have locking to prevent this from happening (this is
why that locking is there!!), although this locking may have been diabled
and/or sabotaged by NFS at your local site.

> Is there something special to do for a shared rw mailbox?

The only way is to use an alternate format which permits multiple
simultaneous access, such as tenex or mh.  Read the Pine Technical notes
for more details on tenex format.  In tenex format, you can do all
read/write operations *except* for expunging deleting messages (expunge
requires exclusive access).

> I *do not*
> want to use IMAP.  I am running UNIX.

IMAP won't help you in this case anyway, unless NFS if between you and the
disk where the folder resides.  If so, then you *must* use IMAP (or log
onto the system which has that disk) since tenex format access will *NOT*
work well over NFS.  Contrary to popular belief, NFS does not fully
implement Unix filesystem semantics.  Multiple sharing with NFS involved
doesn't work.

> Is there a way to rescan the inbox?

Unfortunately, the only way is what you've already discovered; quit and
restart Pine.  That's pretty much the same as what any command to "rescan
the inbox" would have to do.

"BinHex" is a binary-to-text encoding for Apple Macintosh files.  So your 
easiest route is to save the attachment to a file, take it to an Apple 
Macintosh and feed it to an unpacking program such as "StuffIt Expander".

There are also deBinHexers available for DOS and UNIX, but you may well 
find that the deBinHex'd file is a compressed archive (eg, a StuffIt 
archive) that needs further processing.  StuffIt Expander will do it all.

Before Pine prompts you to enter a username and password it first tries 
to use the "rsh" mechanism to fire up the /etc/rimapd program.  If 
successful a pre-authenticated session is started (validated because of 
the rsh used to start it up).

So on the IMAP server machine simply make /etc/rimapd a symbolic link 
pointing at the real IMAP daemon program.

Obviously you'll also need to be able to rsh to the host, so may need to 
set up a .rhosts file (per user) or a global hosts.equiv file to allow 
rsh type access to the server machine.

Hi,

On a machine I have recently installed Pine on (3.89, BTW), I cannot
see how to make Pine print directly into the spool queue - it only
seems to print the message again to the terminal.

The configuration is:

	Linux 1.2.11, Pine 3.89, smail 3.28

I'm sure this is a simple question, to which the answer is totally
obvious, but I'm not sure where to look.  Can you help ?

Jonathan

Thank you very much for the information.  I'll see if I can find a Mac, 
or a Unix 'deBinHex'er.

There is no need to convert from mbox to Eudora, as the mbox is a plain
text file readable by Eudora and viceversa; I'm not familiar with Pegasus
file structure, but you may want to try MailConvert (available at your
nearest info-mac).

Yes, this was exactly the case. We don't use rsh because of security.
It wasn't documented that you could use the port number in the specification
for a remote folder or that it would take longer if you weren't using rsh.
Specifying the port made the password prompt come up immediately.
Thanks alot; this is much more bearable.

I am receiving mail from somebody with elm 109.14 on hpux 9.01, which seems
always to include a header 'Content-Type: Message/rfc822'. If this header
is present and the first line of the body of that mail is NOT BLANK, when
PINE reads that mail it shows up as having attachments 1 and 1.1. When you 
go to view the attachments they are both blank. If I edit the folder and 
delete the header mentioned above or add a blank line in the top of the 
body, it can be seen again.

Is it HP elm or pine at fault?
Any help is appreciated, as we want to roll out PINE and can't unless
it can read this format of mail.

Hi, 

I had a similar problem.  I tried to bring up a file from my PC but 
couldn't get it to come up with Kermit.  Then, I clicked on "Settings" at 
the top of the page and under Binery Transfers noticed I didn't have 
Kermit checked.  I checked off Kermit and it worked.

Maybe that will help.

Bonie,
	You can use BCC's if you enable "Rich Headers" while you are composing
outgoing mail.  Control-R will do it if you're in the header portion of the
compose view.  If this doesn't work, make sure "enable-full-header-cmd" is set
in the setup menu.  Sorry to repeat if your question has already been
answered...

Hi,

I am wondering if there is any way in Pine 3.91 to send blind carbon copies?
I'm going to be putting out a newsletter and want to know the best way to 
handle sending copies of the same material to several people.

It will be printed on software in my PC, so will have to upload it and 
attach it to the mail form I guess.  So.. if I do that will some people 
not be able to read it because of MIME??

Thank you for any suggestions you can give me.

Bonie

Is anyone working on a port of Pine for the Power Macintosh? After browsing

working on the port? Or is everyone just happy with Eudora?

Dear PINE-mavens,

I installed the imapd binary in /usr/local/etc/imapd, added 
the following to /etc/services
imap            143/tcp         #mail transfer
and the following to /etc/inetd.conf
imap    stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/local/etc/imapd    imapd
then I refreshed the inetd daemon with a kill -1
I then try to connect from another machine using pine
(with mail collection set to {myserver.luc.ac.be}INBOX)
and I keep getting this stupid message
[[CLOSED] IMAP connection broken (server response)]
What am I doing wrong? I've tried installing the server this way both on 
an RS/6000 using AIX 3.2.5 and on a DEC Alpha 3000 model 800 under OSF 
2.1. Same result in both instances...

Your Email to martin@luc.ac.be will be greatly appreciated!

Sincerely,

Jan Martin --- martin@luc.ac.be --- http://www.luc.ac.be/~martin/

It sound like the same problem that occurred here today. (Unix-Pine 3.91)
The mail included another mail as body, which started with
'Content-Type: Message/rfc822'

Pine aborted immediately when I tried to read this message.
It was probably trying to decode the included mail as well.

A MIME-bug?

It's a feature!  Many people think that it's useful to show who the
message is to when it's from you, and the "To:" in the index is the clue
that it's from you.

Hi Bonnie

Thank you for your message. Finally I got it, but without Kermit. If you 
are interested how, let me know.

Greetings.

I have an HP running HP-UX 9.03. I have pulled down the sources for
pine3.91. I know that there is a binary executable for HP-UX 9.X
available -- but our problem is that we need to recompile pine to
insure that it does have any trojan horse/back doors in it for
security reasons.

I can't seem to compile this on HP-UX because there is no -ltermcap
to be found, and no -ltermlib either.

Does anyone have an ideas as to how to get this to compile ?

thanks in advance

It looks like Elm is at fault in this case.  The sample you sent should
have been labeled with a Content-Type of Text/Plain instead of
Message/rfc822.  For the latter to be valid, the body of the message
(after the blank line) would have to start with a new set of headers...

The "+" means that *your* address appears in the "To", "Cc", or "Bcc"
fields.  This is so you can tell which mail is addressed to you, and which
is from a list.

  "Bcc" is always in the header, you just have to do a ^R ("rich
headers"), to see the other lines.  If you always want to see it, you can
include it in your "standard" header lines, there is an
appropriately-named setup option for this, one before or one after the
"Custom Headers" option.  READ the help on this option - you need to list
*all* your default headers, not just the extra ones.

Well, the only reasons I can think of for using BCC in this case are 1)
You don't want all the recipients to know who all the other recepients
are.  2)  You don't want any e-mail replies inadvertantly being sent to a
gazillion folx.

It's quite likely - not everybody speaks MIME.

Hi,

We're trying to compile Pine under DOS but are coming up with
lots of compilation glitches under Visual C++. Clearly the working
DOS executable was compiled with something else; what was it?

Also, if you have the diffs for a working DOS compilation with Visual
C++ and wouldn't mind sharing, we'd be interested. We're also going
to do this for windows, if anyone has a Visual C++ setup for that.

In case you're wondering, we need to modify Pine to do Something 
Special and so can't just use the stock binaries. Thanks in advance.

Benny,

If you´re running a Netware server you can use MERCURY.NLM
to work as an SMTP gateway for Pegasus. It also comes with a
POP3 server (MERCURYP.NLM).
Eudora users can connect to the POP-Server and get their mail from
it. Outgoing mail goes from Eudora to the MERCURY SMTP-Server
for forwarding into outer space.
MERCURY is available from:

ftp://risc.ua.edu/pub/network/pegasus/merc121.zip

I you have any questions, please mail me.

Frank

I would be interested in such a thing also (kind of imap-based biff).
I have heard that PC-Pine 3.92 has a feature that if iconified polls the 
server and changes the icon if new mail is detected. So maybe we have to 
wait for 3.92.

  I don't think Pine will ever be ported to the Mac... but the developers
from CAC could probably give a final opinion concerning this subject ;-)

  To answer immediately your last question, yes Eudora can be satisfying for
a personnal use. It's a very nice and powerful program (I'm not talking about
the commercial version, but the freeware release), but it's a POP client, and
thus it's not really well suited for some special mail reading environment.
Personnaly I don't use Eudora at work, because you have no control on the
security of your mail. If you don't care about security problems than Eudora
could be good enough for you. An other "problem" with POP (rather than with
Eudora itself) is that one cannot just pick up the "desired" parts of a
multipart MIME message, you have to retrieve all the message, even if it
contains twice the same information (a part in TIFF an other in GIF for
example), but this will only be a limitation in the future applications of
email. 

  What else to say ? Eudora is handling multiple users accesses to multiple
mailboxes, but it's a bit messy if you want to access your mail using several
clients (for example a domestic client connecting through a PPP or SLIP
server, and some other clients in your office). 

  The choice has not to be made between Eudora and "something else", but
between IMAP and POP3. On the Washington Pine FTP server you can find a text
document that explains the differences between POP and IMAP paradigms. 

  Several IMAP clients are available for the Macintosh, namely Mail Drop,
Mailstrom and Iride (for the free softwares), and there are also commercial
programs. IMHO, Mail Drop, written by Carl BELL from Baylor, is the most
stable of all and sounds really promising. Release 1.1 does not provide
multiple mailbox access, but this should be possible in version 1.2 that
should be published at the end of the summer (according to Carl himself). You
can find all the IMAP clients in the public domain on Sumex's Info-Mac server
and its mirrors (look under comm/tcp/mail). 

  Hope this helps...

Sure.  Bcc: is supported.  Use the custom headers option to
create one routinely, or turn on full-headers to create one manually.
Oh, you want to do it via the addressbook?  Well, I think you need to
define a listname that includes all of the recipients to which you want
to send blind, and specify that listname on your bcc: header.  I guess
you'll need one recipient (even if it's only yourself) in the "To:"
field though.

Depends what you are trying to achieve.  Simplest is to produce your
material in a monospaced font, save it as plain text, and Read that
into your mail.  That will reach any email user, MIME-capable or not,
but format-wise it's totally boring.
 
If you create nicely WYSIWYG formatted text in some proprietary format
and ATTACH it to your mail, then the only recipients who can read it
are those who can decode the MIME _and_ have a copy of the proprietary
word-processing software.
 
There are a number of intermediate possibilities.  So, as I say,
it depends on what you want to achieve (and on how much you know about
the computing/software environment available to your recipients).

With starting a new version of the Pine (3.91) I started having an odd problem.
The "Compose" menu shows double-lines in its header, and the cursor does not
move properly, so I cannot do either compose or forward.
Is there any config options I should take care of? 

Thanks in advance,
-Ellen

I've fixed the problem. Apparently, when Pine was updated i was in the 
middle of using it and got a core dump. After doing some experiments, 
I've killed an old term window, running pine, and started a new one. The 
problem disappeared. Also, it's possible that you can just type the 
commands "tabs" in another window to correct the problem.

Thanks,
-Ellen

Hi all. Is there any way to modify how Pine paints text to the screen, if 
the is the term?

I have a unix-based account, VT100 emulation, and use ProTerm 3.1 --
but I can't capture anything to my buffer, which I'm told is due to some 
feature of Pine. I don't have that problem with Elm, but would like to 
stay with Pine.

Any ideas?

Perhaps someone has a solution for this:

When printing(Y) from PC-PINE-WINDOWS(3.91), I would like to have control 
over the fontsize (on a HP-Laser Jet). 

My print goes to the standard Windows printer, but I can't figure out 
how to control the fontsize (from Pine or Windows/Printer or ?)

Hi Rick,

if you want to edit these files start pico with the explicit path (AND 
the dot) like "pico ~/.signature".

These files are called "hidden", that's why you can't see them in your 
directory listing (Perhaps there is an Option to turn this off/on)

Ciao,
 Michael Joswig

    I wonder if it's your communications software.  I use Pine 3.91 under 
Un*x, VT100 emulation, with ProComm Plus v2 / DOS, and screen capture 
works beautifully for me.  No pain, no strain.  Maybe you just need to 
tweak some setting in ProTerm (which I am not familiar with).

It's a bit more complicated than that.

The first thing you need to do is to have some sort of window manager (at
the very least, a terminal emulator that imitates something like a VT100)
and make all of Pine's cursor positioning codes run under it.  mtest is
build using Symantec C, which provides a console window.  That'd be quite
nice; unfortunately it is a "glass teletype" (no cursor positioning).

You also need to consider memory management.  The native Mac way is like
no other system; although you can use malloc() you're really supposed to
use double-indirect pointers to permit memory shuffling.  To the Mac's
credit, there's no stupid 640K limitation like there is on DOS.

Next, you need to consider how local file management should be done.  The
routines in c-client use the Unix compatibility library in Symantec C,
which is barely adequate for the limited use it is put to (.newsrc,
.mailboxlist, and tmpfile()) by c-client.  To have local folders, you need
to write a suitable driver in c-client, and you're hampered if you use the
Unix compatibility library by the lack of things like ftruncate().  The
best thing is probably to use native Mac system calls.

A related problem is that some very basic operations (like translate a
directory number to its name) can't be done on the Mac; "don't do it that
way" is the usual answer from the Mac hackers.  Apparently they don't want
you to port programs from other operating systems to the Mac (well, gee,
they *do* say that rather explicitly in "Inside Macintosh"...).

I got as far as porting c-client, and seeing to it that the OS-indepedent
parts of Pico compile on the Mac.  At that point, I ran into a wall that
could only be bested by learning a lot more about native Mac system calls
than I had time to expend.  [I did, however, learn enough to write the
MacTCP support code.]

A Mac expert is looking into a Pine port, but there's no definite word on
its feasibility yet.

    Ummm, just how is it you are doing this?  When you say you suspend 
with ^Z, I presume you are on some flavor of Un*x.  ^Z puts a running 
process in the background.  Are you returning pine to the foreground with 
the 'fg' command, or are you starting up additional copies of pine?  I am 
no Un*x guru, but it is conceivable that if you start up too many copies 
of the same process, something could be tripping over something else.  (I 
do know from experience that having multiple copies of pine running can 
cause a folder, such as the INBOX, to go read-only.)

Pine tries to /usr/ucb/rsh the mailserver (with the command
/etc/rimapd). If that fails, pine connects to the imap-port insted.
(thus requiering a username and password).

Set up your account, so you can login without a password
(fx. a .rhosts - file in your homedirectory on the mailserver).
Then pine's try with rsh will succeed and you won't have to enter
username/password.

A killfile is a command that makes the newsreader ignore certain subjects

Is there an easy way to display a PostScript mail message from within
Pine?  More precisely, I receive a message in which the body is a
PostScript file.  I invoke View on it, then | (Pipe), and I enter

	tail +2 | ghostview

as the pipe command.  If I use less instead of ghostview, the PostScript
source looks okay -- the blank line separating the mail headers from the
body is stripped.  But ghostview only produces a blank page.

Suggestions would be most appreciated.

Hi,

I'm new here, we're not (yet?) using Pine, but are looking at it.
I've run into a problem that *must* be well known, but I saw
nothing about it in the FAQ.  It occurs when the mail contains
either MIME-encoded or 8 bit ISO-Latin characters.  The problem
occurs on the PC version(s).

If a letter is sent containing 'foreign' (accented) characters,
on the DOS version, they are converted correctly using the
code page so that they display correctly on the screen.

However, on the Windows version, the characters are also converted
to the code page, however, since windows uses the ISO-Latin character
set, the conversion should *not* be done.

What can I do?


Thanks

-Pete

Hi Rick,

ghostview expects the name of the file you want to process.

Try  "ghostview -" instead, that should work (It does on Unix, check your 
version which switch to use to read from stdin.

Hi Everyone,

Today, I received a request to provide the computer users at our
facility with a *very* simple "news" program.  This "news" program
will provide information such as the lunch menu in the cafeteria,
training classes scheduled, notices about software changes, etc.

We're running on a UNIX platform, and my initial thought was to allow
the users to use PINE.  From what *I* can see, PINE is very simple to
use, and we could set up (additional) local newsgroups for the new
information that needs to be posted.

Some information, like the dinner menu, should expire quickly.  Other
postings, such as software changes should linger around for a while.
Again, this looks like a perfect task for newsgroups.

I was told, however, that PINE is too hard for some computer users.
Some of the users will be people with absolutely no computer
experience.  I really think that the newsgroup mechanism would work
wonderfully, but I need to find a "simpler" interface.

I thought many folks here have probably evaluated several news readers
and might be able to answer:

	Are there any *very* simply news readers out there for UNIX?

Thanks!
Paul

Hi,

I am in need of bounce-to-newsgroup support in Pine.  I found a post from
David Miller in the archives saying that it isn't supported (obviously).
But looking at the code, it seems like all that would have to happen is for
pine/reply.c:bounce() to set up the extra parameters and call
pine/send.c:pine_send() instead of pine/send.c:pine_simple_send().
Or, pine/reply.c:bounce() could create the METAENV structure and call
pine/send.c:news_poster().

Now, I'll be the first to admit that I haven't tried to set up the extra
parameters, and doing so may prove difficult, but I hear people all the time
looking for a method of posting to a moderated newsgroup, and this is the
way to do it.  I'll let everyone know how it goes; comments welcome.

Regards,

David

Pine is by far the simplest of the half dozen or so unix news readers
I've tried. Others have more features, but are definitely harder for
new users to use. ( There are some very easy GUI oriented Mac newsreaders, 
and maybe the same for MS-Windows, but most of them don't seem to handle
high volume as well as  telnet-ing to a unix host. )

But maybe you should reconsider the idea of using newsgroups for 
this info - maybe a gopher or web server would be a better way. 
They might require more maintenance for the staff, but would, I
think, be easier for the users to navigate, and there are several 
clients for unix, mac and ms-dos/windows to choose from. You can
even construct some interactive services, and you can gateway 
just about anything. ( TIME magazine may be trying to sell you
on the idea of interactive shopping on the WorldWideWeb, but really
and practically, most folks NOW are using it as a electronic bulletin
board, whether for internal use or for their customers or both. )

I have never used pine but someone told me that `slrn' is easier to use than
pine is.  Quite a few people have told me that they think it has the best
user interface of any unix newsreader (tin, trn, nn, ...).  Of course it is
much more powerful than pine.  It is available from space.mit.edu in
pub/davis/slrn.  Here is a list of features:

  * True referenced-based threading
  * Draws a colored thread tree using line drawing characters
  * Multiple server support
  * Multiple windows
     - Header summary window showing threads
     - Article window
  * Customizable 
     - Keybindings
     - Colors
         For example, the default colors, say, using a color xterm such as
	 rxvt, shows the top status bar in blue on white, the author's name
	 in the header summary window as magenta on white, the thread tree
	 as red lines connecting subject titles, the window status lines
	 appear as yellow on blue, the article headers in the article window
	 are cyan on white, the quoted text appears as red on white, and
	 the body of the article appears as blue on white.
     - Server -> newsrc mappings
  * Smart screen updating
  * Online help which is also customizable
  * Automatic reconnect if server drops connection
  * Fast on slow modem connections.  It does not read the whole active file
     like many other newsreaders.
  * Compile with TERM support under Linux

So far I've modified pine/send.c:pine_send() to show me what is contained
in the paramters that are sent to pine_send() but not pine_simple_send().
>From the .pine-debug file:

pine_send === editor_title = COMPOSE MESSAGE
pine_send === fcc_arg = NULL
pine_send === reply_list = 0
pine_send === ref_list = NULL

I guess I can't go wrong simulating this in pine/reply.c:bounce(), eh?

I think PINE is the easiest newsreader for UNIX by far, once someone 
(like you) has set up the config file (which isn't hard for someone like 
you.)

Yes - you are quite right.  But you have answered my question by pointing
me at the 'setup' screen.  Thankyou.

Can the same 'config' options get me out of second problem - namely that
all mail sent from Pine on that machine has the 'From <user>' bit right,
but the 'ReplyTo:' always comes out as <user>@localhost rather than the
machine's real name.

I have always found tin and rn very unintuitive to use.  In particular 
the way that articles "disappear" as soon as you have looked at them.  In 
fact the newsreader has simply hidden them because you have looked at 
them.  I much prefer Pine's paradigm of getting you to actually Delete 
them to hide them.

I still find Tin tricky the odd time I use it.  Sometimes "q" seems to 
take me out a menu level, and sometimes it dumps me out of the program 
(when I was expecting to go up a level instead).

We're finding here that whilst our Technocrats seem to have a preference 
for Tin (and slagging of Pine), many new users are finding Pine just 
great for newsreading.  I'm fairly sure that we have people now using 
Usenet News because of Pine, but wouldn't be if they'd had the hurdle of 
Yet Another Program to learn.

If Pine's interface really is a problem (and I don't see why it should be 
if they're familiar with using it for e-mail) then you may have to be 
looking at an alternative technology.

For example, we use World-Wide Web browsers with some home written CGI 
scripts to provide a nice friendly browsing/inserting mechanism for Small 
Ads and Login News/Notices.  However this works better for "one way" 
announcements, rather than the two-way chains of discussions News is so 
much better at.  It's a thought...

I am trying to use Pine 3.89 as a news reader with limited 
success. I defined the nntp-server and news-collections 
variables in .pinerc. I created .newsrc with entries for each 
news group I am interested in. Each news group now shows up in 
my folder list and is accessible. My problem is when I specify 
e(X)punge, I receive the message:

   "[eXclude of deleted news not implemented yet.]"

This leads me to believe that I have either missed something in 
pinerc or 3.89 was still not ready for primetime.

Similarly, I am unable to access the list of all newsgroups 
using the (A)dd command. I receive the error:

   "[News subscribe and selection screen not ready yet!]"

Your help is greatly appreciated.

I don't think news is even the best approach.  Gopher explicitly presents
everything in menus.  It is possible to setup scripts that use the gopher
client to open a particular part of the server.  I have written simple
scripts name "help" and "policy" that do this kind of thing.

Well it didn't work like I expected - it dumped me into the composer.
It probably wiped out the headers too.  Back to option 2.

It's not actually PINE doing the job.  It's your systems mailer daemon.
Forwarding mail is pretty simple though...

Create a file in your directory called ".forward".  In that file, type on
the first line the address you want your mail forwarded to.

(Sample: user@inter.net)

Hope this helps....

Subject: {Q}Problem with Pine spell check
Date: 28 Jul 1995 12:21:17 GMT
Message-Id: <3vaknt$5iu@fox.friends.edu>
Status: O
X-Status: 

I have recently been asked to start administrating our internet server so
I will appologize "up-front" for being semi UNIX ignorant.<g>

We are having a problem with the spell check feature within Pine (Pico).
Pine and Pico seem to work just fine but when you ask for it spell check, 
it just refreshes the screen and says that it is done.  Now we all know
that the spell checker ALWAYS finds something that it thinks is misspelled.
With that in mind I even purposely misspelled many words and it passed them
right up.  I guess my question is if there is a config. file that points to
a data base of words or maybe a switch somewhere that isn't set right.
Any words of wisdom is appreciated.  Thanks...

   So on the IMAP server machine simply make /etc/rimapd a symbolic link

   Obviously you'll also need to be able to rsh to the host, so may need to

Hmm.  After creating the symlink (I already had rsh authentication),
PC-Pine still doesn't preauthenticate me.  Does anyone have additional
suggestions?

I'd say that either Pine or Lynx (with the `news:' URL) are the
easiest.  How about if you create a Web page with a list of
the newsgroups linked using the `news:' URL and then give people
a choice of using either Pine of Lynx to participate in the 
newsgroups?

   I am in need of bounce-to-newsgroup support in Pine.  I found a post from
   David Miller in the archives saying that it isn't supported (obviously).
   But looking at the code, it seems like all that would have to happen is for
   pine/reply.c:bounce() to set up the extra parameters and call
   pine/send.c:pine_send() instead of pine/send.c:pine_simple_send().
   Or, pine/reply.c:bounce() could create the METAENV structure and call
   pine/send.c:news_poster().

   Now, I'll be the first to admit that I haven't tried to set up the extra
   parameters, and doing so may prove difficult, but I hear people all the time
   looking for a method of posting to a moderated newsgroup, and this is the
   way to do it.

I must be misunderstanding something here.  Shouldn't your news software
by taking care of moderated groups, so that posting normally (by pine or
any other means) will have the effect of reaching the moderators?

Your emails still come from leandro, but when replying the right address

Subject: Bug for Pine 3.91, with a bad "personal-name" changing return address

The
personal-name
 in setup configuration threw me off.

My login ID @ this host is m012499, and my email alias is Robert.McDowell

I had "personal-name" set to Robert W. McDowell, M.D.

PINE took this  and made a line:

>From    : Robert W. McDowell, M.D. <"Robert.W. McDowell, M.D."@vtmednet.org>

Many mailers took this as the reply address instead of the "From" line at 
the very top of the message.

Thus a lot of people would try to reply, and would have their mail 
refused by my host.

Thanks!

PC-Pine doesn't use pre-authentication, since it is so easy to forge you

I've seen a message sent from a "SUPERUSER" that appeared to send a

Anybody have any ideas???

What type of system are you using?  Some Linux systems use ispell rather
than the traditional spell program and the command syntax is incompatible.
The Linux port of Pine has not been updated to take that into account...

I was wondering if anyone could help me.  I recently purchased Procomm

print when I type in "Y", "Y".  I simply get a response that says "printing 
complete" from Pine, but I don't get anything from the printer.  The printer 
itself works perfectly with other applications and somehow it works part 
of the time.  I've tried everything in the printer setup of Procomm but 
nothing seems to have a long lasting effect.  Please Help!!!!!!

:I think PINE is the easiest newsreader for UNIX by far, once someone 
:(like you) has set up the config file (which isn't hard for someone like 
:you.)

Actually, trn is the easiest: you never hit but space, and an 8-command
cheat sheet is more than adequate.  Nonetheless, you still have to give
them a start-up file.  Most of the problems with sophisticated packages
like trn, X windows, vi, emacs, and a host of similar things is that
without super simple config files, computer users without a programming
background will be lost.  The right 30 minute tutorial by the appropriate
guru sitting down and making your world better as YOU defined better will
make all the difference.

Try the latest version of Netscape (from www.mcom.com), it contains
a newsreader, much better than pine (but not too god).

I talked our "guru" into reconfiguring trn to use "pico -t" as the 
default editor for trn.  Made using trn a breeze for people coming from 
pine.  And, in turn, made my support job one heck of a lot easier.  But I 
have asked him to set up an evaluation copy of slrn - gotta see if there 
can be anything easier than trn. :)

Hi!

I set up xv as an image-viewer. My xv is capable of viewing postscript files.
Still I can't view postscript file in attachment even if I put ghostview 
into the image-viewer line in pine configuration.
If I try to view a postscript file in attachment it says
[Don't know how to display attachment format Application/POSTSCRIPT].

How to fix it?

Any help will be appreciated very much.

pine -create_lu addrbook fullname

PC Pine 3.91 returns the error: addrbook: Can't create temporary file

I don't have any idea where it is trying to create a temp file because I
have write access everywhere.  Is this a bug or am I missing something?

BTW: On the side, what does the .lu file index exactly?

How can I exclude a given country from a posting of an article.  I
sometimes use pine to post the news directly and sometimes I use Pine
through a remailer such as news.demon.co.uk

Also is this excluding reliable?       How does it actually happen?     Do
I control it by excluding a country or including the countries I want it to
go to?

I would appreciate any help you could provide on this, through either above
scenerio, to me by return email.  Thanks.

IMHO, TIN is easier for a beginner, or a non-unix savy user, but the TIN 
defaults of deleteing stuff you have read (acually it doesn't delete, it 
just doesn't show it) etc are not good, but any TIN user should go thru 
the M menu and reset the defaults to your preference for sorting 
threading etc etc etc, ... TIN can also do thing PINE can't like make 
.kill files etc. ... Don't forget that also in TIN you can press h for 
help at anytime and get a much more detailed list of available options 
than you see at the bottom of the screen ...  Only my 895 cents worth ... 
G'Day. ... Hope this helps ...

your sig file should (MUST) be named .signature, not signature.  The (.) 
is important.  Alternatively, and IMHO a better way, name it sig and ^R 
it in when you want it.  G'Day.

Hoo boy.  This post is with slrn set up to use pico -t as the editor.  
Been fiddling with a test group for what seems forever.  This should 
work.  It may even identify me as me.  slrn feels a bit awkward after 
trn, but it is faaaaast.  Not having to grab all of the threading info 
until asked probably lessens the load on the server.  While I was at it, 
I set up 2 aliases - one for work in good old black and white, and one 
for home in living 16 colour.  Hmmm.  It also posts faster than trn.  But 
changing the editor from vi to pico is what kept me from just tossing 
it.  And learning the new key combinations will be great for avoiding 
repetitive motion syndrome :)  Now, all I need to know is why the -create 
flag didn't work properly ... I'm sure there is more than one whole 
newsgroup on that server ...

Hi everyone,

Anybody who can help me find some CAPI (Computer Aided Personal
Interviewing) programs/binaries on the net that can be read using
mail viewers like PINE, ELM, PEGASUS, etc. What I'm  looking
for precisely is something which has an AutoMailBack feature, ie
when I send people a self-completion questionnaire by e-mail upon
opening their mail one is prompted to fill in the questionnaire,
complete with skip patterns and at the end prompted to type a  
character(s) which will activate AutoMailBack and the completed
questionnaire is sent back to me. I'm not sure if anybody has
been down this path before but I reckon there must be someone or
people out there who might help.

Positive suggestions, contributions from gurus and enthusiasts
alike are most welcome.

Thank you

Peli

is there any way to use an external filter either from the compose
screen or with mail that has been received (without first exporting
the text)? this is relevant eg for reversing the direction of
hebrew text i just wrote backwards, or reversing the direction
of received hebrew text before printing it.
of course, it can all be done offline or outside the pine program,
but it would be very convenient to access filters from within
pine.

info about my parameters:
one of the service providers i use might have an "old-growth"
option that includes being able to use a pipe. i'm not sure,
and i don't understand what choosing an "old-growth" option
in .pinerc would do.
all the unix pine programs that i use are three point something.

    IF you are on a Unix system (which it looks like you might be), and 
IF you have not specified otherwise in your configuration with the 
signature-file variable, then your signature file must be in your home 
directory and named exactly .signature with a mandatory leading period.

The pipe command will allow you to cause a received message to be used
as standard input of a program like a filter.

For composing messages, you can use an alternate editor.  Look
for one that will allow you to define a macro that accomplishes what
you want to do.

Hi!

I am using Eudora for Windows 1.4.4 at home and PINE 3.91 on my mainframe 
account. When being at home I read my mail on the mainframe account using the
POP3 protocol. How do I configure PINE that mail, read using Eudora is no
longer listed as new? What I do not want is to delete the mail on the server
(i.e. mainframe account).

Thanks for your help,

		Marcus

We've been moving people from our ageing VAX Allin1 system to UNIX with 
pine, and, although most are pleased with the relative ease of using pine, a 
couple of things have been noticed that allin1 does better. I would be 
interested in knowing if there's an easier way of doing these and, if 
not, I wonder if future versions of pine will provide an easier way. They 
are:

1 - Many, many addresses in the To: or Cc: fields of an allin1 messages 
are wrapped down to the bottom of the message. I know that one can use 
Bcc: to hide this list, but many here would prefer that the addresses 
appear somewhere, but not right at the top where they must be waded 
through. Doesn't bother me, but there are many...

2 - I receive a list of attachments, and I can save each attachment 
individually to a directory, but I cannot save attachments to a mail 
folder like I can other messages. In allin1 this is accomplished through 
the FT [file text] option, and a number of people have become used to it. 
Shouldn't "save to mail folder"  be an option as well as "save to disk"?

Just curious...

Hi, all.  sorry for the beginning question, but I've checked the
documentation without much luck...

I'd like to bind some keys in pine 3.91.  specifically, I'd like to
use control-w as delete-backward-word.  how would I do that?

many thanks!

Put the multiple users in the bcc: (activate rich headers with ^R in the 
header portion of the compose screen) and put yourself on the To: line.

My news software (tin and inn) do get the posts to the moderator's mail,
but I need something for the moderators to get the mail approved and posted.
Maybe you can suggest a program other than pine?

Subject: Sorting Mail using Procmail
Message-Id: <DCKAy9.IH1@ennews.eas.asu.edu>
Date: Mon, 31 Jul 1995 03:56:32 GMT
Status: O
X-Status: 

I am trying to sort mail into different folders using procmail. I have set
up the .forward file and the .procmailrc correctly (I think). The .procmailrc
looks like this:

MAILDIR=$HOME/mail

#Directory for storing procmail log and rc files
PMDIR=$HOME/.procmail
LOGFILE=$PMDIR/log

:0:
* ^Subject:.*test
IN.testing

Even though I created the folder IN.testing in the "Incoming Message Folders",
any mail with "test" in the subject goes into a folder called IN.testing in
the Folder-Collection (mail/[]). As a result I cannot step thru all new
mail using the TAB key. Any ideas as to what I am doing wrong?

TIA,
Nischal.

     You need to create your incoming message folders in a different 
directory than your folder collection. Try something like:

MAILDIR=$HOME/Mail
-or-
MAILDIR=$HOME/Incoming

    Then set that up in your incoming-folders variable in your .pinerc
file.

Good Luck...

    From the Main Menu, go into Setup and Config.  There is a field 
user-domain which you can adjust for From: (in fact, I adjust mine 
slightly).  Reply-To: is an optional added header (a screen or two 
further down) which you have to put in by hand, anyway, and you can 
make it read anything you want.
