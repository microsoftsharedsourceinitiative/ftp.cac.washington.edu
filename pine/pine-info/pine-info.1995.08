	I was just wondering, How can i move my cursor word by word when 
composing a mail message? I think the editor that pine uses is pico im 
not sure ( It resembles it a whole lot)
	Im tired of looking like a fool try to get from part of a sentece 
to the next, tapping that button like a madman.
	Incedently in case anyone else wants to know..

	to get to the end of the sentence tpye
		ctrl-e
	to get to the beggining of the sentence type 
		ctrl-a
much like most editors

							thanks

Hmm,

do you have a directory /mail and do you have write permissions on it?

try "touch /mail/tryit" if you get the same error again you either have to create /mail and 
check  your permission or check your config.

BTW on UNIX mail is kept in /var/spool/mail or /var/mail, I've never seen /mail?

Ciao,
 Michael J

Thanks to Timothy Cheney, but part of the problem here is
that the pipe command doesn't seem to be recognized,
because it is part of an "old-growth" config option according
to the man page, but i don't see it as an option in the
standard .pinerc, so i'm kind of lost here. or, maybe i haven't
used the pipe at the right place? maybe that helps define
where i am lost?
thanks, gideon

I was wondering if this is 'normal', an extension added to 
UltiMail, or if Pine simply does not support multipart messages.

If the last, will Pine (4.00?) support it?

Pine interprets the .mailcap file itself and does not use metamail.  Pine
does honor the MAILCAPS environment variable to specify a new path.

Your ULTIMAIL correspondant can set the size of message to a LARGE number 
like 10 Mb, and then it won't get split.

You can use Ctrl-SPACE to move forward a word. I don't know how to go
backwards though.

this is a followup to the question about how to use an external filter
in PINE. it has been suggested that using a pipe symbol could
handle incoming messages. however,
i have tried this with three different internet service providers
that i use, with these results:

Provider A: PINE 3.91 -- both in the index to Inbox, and when
   looking at the message text itself, i get the same result
   when i type in the pipe: i get
   Command "|" not defined for this screen ...
Provider B: PINE 3.89 -- exactly the same as with provider A
Provider C: PINE 3.07 -- again i get a refusal, but the message is
   Piping message into UNIX command not implemented yet

So, i submit, there is more to this story than meets the eye
when one just looks at the manpage. does anyone know what might
be going on?
thanks, gideon

How can I send out a control cancel, or delete
on a message posted to a newsgroup with
PINE?

I have tried though TIN, but it is incompatible 
when initially posted through PINE.

Does anyone know how to configure Pine so that the Setup
option is disabled so users cant go fiddling with all the 
settings.  I know that you have a pine.conf.fixed file in
/usr/local/lib to set defaults that cant be overridden, but 
it would be nice to disable this setup option altogether.
Some of our computer users are kind of prone to mucking
around.
Any help would be appreciated.

I have the same kind of setup here at work. I know there is an option under
 the special/switches menu called "Leave mail on sever" - this should stop
 Eudora from deleting the mail as it retrieves it.

  In pine 3.91 (provider A) go to the main menu, then to the Set up
screen, then to the Config screen, find the line with the text
`enable-unix-pipe-cmd' and set it on (using the key X). If this is not
possible, then your provider disabled it and ask him to allow this command
for you.  In every case, having enabled it you can use the pipe command.

Hope this helps,  V. S.

We are in the process of transitioning from cc:mail to POP and imap.  Other
than using the Link to SMTP from cc:Mail I do not think cc:Mail can use
either the POP or Imap protocols directly.  What we have done for our
transition is set up a SMTP gateway into the POP server so that users can
mail cc:Mail messages and POP messages easily.  But it still does not let
cc:Mail directly use either POP or imap.

   I have Linux set up on my machine and I connect to my ISP using a SLIP

message stating that the connection was refused.  I have no problems 
sending mail out using SMTP, but I'm not allowed to check my mailbox.
   This initially appears to be a problem with the username and password, 
but I've tried a few things around this.  My username and password on the 
Linux machine are the same as on my provider, but that doesn't help.

   If anyone has any ideas or suggestions, I'd appreciate them.

We use Pine to connect to a remote server that runs the IMAP daemon.  This
works by putting the address of the remote server in the inbox field.  I can
send you a sample config if you want.

There are two icons in the Pine distribution (at least in my one ;-)

BTW I'm using a shelltool on my Sun with one of these icons. Isn't there an equivalent on HP?

You can add "disable-config-cmd" to the feature-list in pine.conf.fixed to
turn off the Setup/Config screen for all users....

Can one change the default location of pine.conf.fixed in the same way as 
pine.conf with a command line option of -P? I can't seem to make it look 
anywhere but /usr/local/lib/pine.conf.fixed. The -P works fine for 
changing /usr/local/lib/pine.conf but it will still look for 
pine.conf.fixed in /usr/local/lib even though pine.conf has been changed 
with the -P option. Version 3.91 HP-UX 9.01.

No, the location of pine.conf.fixed is not changeable from the command
line, since that would defeat the purpose of it! ;)

I don't know offhand if any of the following are shareware or freeware, 
so please don't quote me on that part, but...I'm assuming a 2400 baud 
modem with the above setup, since I don't think he'll be able to connect 
at any higher a speed.  A vt100 communications software package like 
MS-Kermit, QuickLink, ProComm, or ComIT should work just fine for him.  I 
was on the same setup, with a 2400 baud modem, for three years, 
connecting to our Unix server here using MSKermit.  If he tries this 
arrangement or something similar, and is having problems, feel free to 
e-mail me off-list and I'll see if I can troubleshoot for you...

I can't seem to post messages that I want posted on some newsgroups at 
the same time

Could anybody tell me the way I should configure the address of the 
newsgroup so that it does reach the destination and doesn't end up in my 
mailbox again.
Thanks in advance,

thanks to a czech angel, whose name i do not have handy at the moment,
i've found out that the way to get piping, at least in recent PINE,
is either to go to Setup in main menu, and then to config,
or, if that doesn't give you the appropriate options, then
there is a place (there was in my case)
in .pinerc to ask for it.
thanks to everyone who tried to assist with this!

Many of our users find pine to be a fine product, but many more people in
the world don't use it. So we have problems with binary attachments not
being decodable by recipients. Can we send them a stand-alone MIME 
decoder, or how do we tell pine to use uuencoding instead of MIME?

If your HP-UX is using Vue, try editing your X resources:

	Vuewm*pine*iconImage: filename.bmp

That way when you start up pine as follows:

	xterm -e pine &

It should pick up the resource name of pine and use the above resource.

HI..

I'm wondering if there is a way to add symbols in the text when composing 
in Pine.  (ie:  Copyright a circle with a "c" in it.)

Thanks.

same accent (alt-130) Pico responds "unknown command".  Any assistance=20

I have experienced the same 30+ second delay running PINE on
IBM RS/6000 Workstation.. I've built the executable over and over
trying to tune and optimizing it...

Interesting enough, these workstation are all NFS mounting their
home and applications directories for a single superserver, if I 
perform a POP or IMAP to a standalone system, it only takes 5
seconds... go figure...

Workstation are all running AIX v3.2.5 and standalone is running
the latest and greatest AIX v4.1

Actually, you can put your incoming mail folders wherever you wish.
The trick is that you have to specify the inboxes using path names
relative to your login directory.  Here's a sample section from a
.pinerc:

# List of incoming msg folders besides INBOX, e.g. ={host2}inbox, {host3}inbox
# Syntax: optnl-label {optnl-imap-host-name}folder-path
incoming-folders="netinstruct" mail/IN.netinstruct,
	"crust-l" mail/IN.crust-l,
	"mar-facil-l" mail/IN.mar-facil-l

My apologies of I missed this in dicussions about 3.92 functionality, but 
will Pine fix/enhance the operation of ^C/N options for sending and 
printing?  Specifically, when printing (Y) option ^C would cancel and N 
would prompt for a different destination/printer command.  For sending, 
^C would offer cancel *message* (with confirm), while N would simply 
cancel the send.

Right now it seems that the duplicate functionality of ^C and N in these 
(and other?) operations could be eliminated and operation enhanced if 
changed.

Message-Id: <3vqm15$9i4$1@mhade.production.compuserve.com>

  I am having a problem compiling PINE on a Uniys SVR4 system.
  IMAP and PICO compile fine.  PICO runs great.  As soon as
  PINE starts to comile I get an error from make.  
  The error is as follows:
      ***  Error 1   (bu21)
  The compiling stops there.  If i try to compile some of the files
  manually no object files are created.
  If anyone has any ideas I would be grateful.
        Thanks   DaveM.

To Whom it May Concern:

	Sorry to bother you with this but I asked at the Help Desk and I 
would like to see if you have an alternative answer to this question.  
The problem is:  whenever I send an e-mail message outside of Canada, the 
other party doesn't get it.  For example, I sent about 8 messages to a 
friend in the U.K. and he only received one.  I have no problems sending 
messages within
Canada though.  I know the addresses are correct because I don't get it 
rejected by the U of A after I send it.  Hopefully you can give me a 
solution to this problem.  Thankyou for  your time.

Sonja, the problem appears to be at the receiving end (lsi-logic.co.uk).  
Currently, the site looks to be down.  I've sent you e-mail under

Hi!! Hi!!!

Windows 95 is almost here and is there any plan that someone will port 
the PC-PINE to Win32 api???  or is it possible to write a gateway to 
MAPI so Win95's exchange client can retrieve IMAP mail directly into 
private exchange folder???? (Well, it's certainly Great for Bill)

and does it hard to write a IMAP daemon for Window NT???

Has anybody experienced this same problem...

that if you want to suppress fcc, then specify "" at the 'default-fcc' 
field and Pine (supposedly) won't write an fcc.  It seems to me that Pine 
creates a "" folder and stil fcc's when it shouldn't.

I have a text file with a long list of email addresses.
Is there any way to put this file at the To: section of the header?
I tried to cut/paste the addresses from the text file into to To: section 
of the header, but the addresses overflowed into the Attchmnt: and 
Subject: sections of the header.

I really don't want to retype all these addresses into my address book.

Your server system is almost certainly set up so that the command:
	rsh imapserver /etc/rimapd
(where "imapserver" is the name of your IMAP server) hangs instead of
returning an immediate rejection (e.g. "Permission denied").

This is often caused by TCP wrappers and or gateway filters, and is
exacerbated by a bug in rsh which causes TCP or IP level rejections to be
ignored.

To work around this, specify the port number explicitly in the mailbox
name:
	{imapserver:143}inbox
This will cancel the rsh attempt.

I have been experimenting with the anon.penet.fi anonymous mailer for 
posting to usenet

I've been able to sucessfully post to alt.test and misc.test.  


But....

In order to post to an existing thread (without breaking the thread) I 
need to be able to add an Xref: header to my message before it goes off 
to penet.

How can I add a header (not defined when I use CRTL-r while in the header)?

The problem is that if you specify "" in the Setup/Config screen, Pine
quotes it and uses it, i.e. if you look in your .pinerc file, you will see

	default-fcc=""""

To actually set an empty value in the Setup/Config screen, press 'a' to
Add, then immediately press RETURN.

Pine 3.92 will look for the special case of "" and treat it as a NULL
entry...

Hi Simeon,

goto Setup/Config and Add to "customized-hdrs" your Xref, that should work.

When using pico with MS-Terminal or kermit I find that I can't exit pico. 
It's keeps telling me unknown command.  

However, when I use pico from withine Pine to compose a message I have no
problem.  Any ideas?

Well, I'm posting this from a 286 at 14.4 (57.6 line speed), so I have to
disagree about not being able to connect above 2400b.  For the record, I'm
using vt100 and Procomm/dos 2.01, but almost anything will work.  I've
also used telemate 4.20, which is excellent -- particularly if you want to
stay away from expensive commercial products. 

To answer the question about downloading mail:  It can be done, but it's
not easy to set up from scratch.  First, you have to make sure that uqwk
(available at ftp.gte.com) is installed on the host unix machine, and then
you need a dos program that can read your downloaded mail and news.  I use
yarn (available at ftp.coast.net/simtel/msdos/offline) and I strongly
recommend it.  Yarn works with whatever text editor you happen to choose,
and it also has built-in hooks for the pgp encryption program, if that's
important.  Also, I've found the olmenu script (available via ftp at
america.net/pub/users/kgrisham) to be invaluable for setting things up on
the unix end. 

Hope this helps.

   I am using PINE on vms. For some time I've been having difficulty send

the message b4 sending it out. The server recquires any command be on the
first line. 
   Is any of this true? Is there anything I can do about it?

>and does it hard to write a IMAP daemon for Window NT???  

I would greatly appreciate anyone who can solve this problem for me.
I am using Windows NT for everything (but mail) and like it very much.
But, I have not been able to find any IMAP Daemons that will run on NT.
Thus, if I want to use Pine, which I like very much, we have to install
a Unix box just for this purpose. Microsoft does not yet support 
Internet mail on NT (???). But, you can get a DOS Daemon (the name 
escapes me) that requires a dedicated box to run. I don't want this 
either. I just want to use PC Pine to access an IMAP Daemon running on
our NT Gateway box... If anyone has found a solution to this problem
please clue me in...

Thanks,

One option you have for this problem is to have sendmail take care of 
this quirk of pine.  (I got the following info on comp.mail.sendmail from 
Bjart Kvarme).

In your /etc/sendmail.cf file, add the following line before the 
rulesets.  (I put mine right after the line saying "Kdequote dequote" and 
before the "Special Macros" section"):


# Define our userdb file for pine rewrites
Kuserdb btree -o /etc/userdb.db



Then, add the following ruleset #1.  (I put mine right after Ruleset 0):



##################################################
### Ruleset 1, rewrite sender header & envelope ##
##################################################
#Thanks to Bjart Kvarme <bjart.kvarme@usit.uio.no>
S1
R$- < @ $=w . > $*      $: $1 < @ $2 . > $3 ?? $1       username@localhost ?
R$+ ?? $+               $: $1 ?? $(userdb $2 : mailname $: @ $)
R$+ ?? @                $@ $1                           Not found
R$+ ?? $+               $>3 $2                          Found, rewrite

#NOTE      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#	   Use Tab Characters  Use Tab Characters in these regions
# to make three columns (the line with "mailname" only has 2 columns).

This is how mine is set up and it works great without having to alter 
pine's code.

Also, if you have a "SLIP" or "PPP" connection, another good thing to do 
in the /etc/sendmail.cf file is to move the line for the nameserver 
lookup in ruleset 96 to the bottom of the ruleset so that your local mail 
can be delivered even when you don't have a connection to a nameserver.  
The key two lines to move to the bottom of the ruleset are:

# pass to name server to make hostname canonical
R$* < @ $* $~P > $*             $: $1 < @ $[ $2 $3 $] > $4


Hope this helps.

	Jerry

The .lu file is a LookUp-file for PINE. It's ment for faster access to your adressbook. 
It's good to have it!

Any thoughts on why I am not able to display all of the ASCII charaters=20
in Pico?  With alt-160 I can display =A0, but when I want an e with the=20
same accent (alt-130) Pico responds "unknown command".  Any assistance=20
will be appreciated.

    It is a file Pine builds automatically for its own internal 
operations with your address book.  Hang on to it.  It makes Pine 
more efficient.

Does there exist a description of how to implement pine on pc's?
I am using it on SUN's and it is working well.  I would like to try
it on some PC users to see if I could get out of the dual-mail
management business.  I would like a 1-2-3 step-by-step document that has 
been used by someone else.  I think since I have NT on all my PC's and 
thus they all have tcp/ip this should be an easy job, but I do not have a 
lot of time to devote to it.  Can anyone help?

When your cursor is in the headers, hit CTRL-R (^r), this will display 
the "expanded" or "rich" headers...

Bcc: should now appear. Just place the addresses in the Bcc: instead of 
the To: or Cc: area

Since PC-Pine does not support allowing users to change password, I was
wondering how most are handling this?  I was thinking of having the users
telnet to the imap server and have the login program run passwd for them
(they will not be doing anything else on the imap server).  Other
possibilities?

IMAP Daemons serve out mail files on the server, what mail files are you
think about? Microsoft Mail? cc:Mail? none of these PC mail files are in
such a format that 3rd parties are welcome to manipulate (Lotus has been 
know to change their format when someone found out what the file looks 
like). Or are you thinking of using some kind of UNIX mail format on NT?
That can probably be done, but I don't believe anyone has such a product.

Any hopes of including PGP support in PINE? mkpgp works ok, but it would 
be REALLY nice if PGP could be integrated in pine as well as MIME support 
is for attachments. i.e., every message you type in pine would be 
automatically signed by your secret key and messages sent to you would 
automatically be checked for validity, and decrypted on the fly without 
you even knowing it. Imagine all the new people that would be using pgp 
if it was as simple as that.

I need help in setting up my box to allow local newsgroups, ie, local forums.
No matter how I try to configure the pine.conf file I cannot get the
right formula to allow for newsgroups to exist on my server.
Any ideas?
I have been working with the tech-notes and cannot figure out an
appropriate system.
Thanks.

I have this on all lines in my .pinerc which reference the server, and I

I am running OpenVMS 6.1, DEC TCP/IP 3.2 (soon to be 3.3), and PMDF 5.0, and 
am trying to get Pine 3.91 beta 5 (from Israel) to see a remote mail server 
supporting imap, pop3, and pop. It only sees the local mail box.  The problem 
is, is that I want mail to only be received and sent through the remote server 
(ideally, disabling VMS mail).  

One other note, the setup I am shooting for is to be used only by our 
student population.  Faculty and staff will still be able to send/receive 
mail locally.

Any suggestions for the setup?

(Also, it seems our Ultrix admin is having a similar problem.)

I'd need simple message locking so that when one person is

Freeware or commercial software will do.

This message means that the server system is not running an IMAP server.
"Connection refused" means that you tried to connect to a TCP port (143 is
the assigned port for IMAP) that has no server listening.

So, the first step to debug the problem is to negotiate with the server
system's management to run an IMAP server.

Hello!

A few month ago someone posted a little patch for PINE 3.91 to this
newsgroup. This patch allowed to send 8-bit-characters instead of
MIME-quoted-printable. I applied the patch to the source of PINE and
recompiled it. The patch worked fine since then. But unfortunately I lost the
source of the patch as well as the binary due to a harddisk crash a few weeks
ago. 

If the originator of this patch or someone else who saved it, reads this
article, it would be nice if he could mail it to me or post it again to this
newsgroup. 

Bye, Gunnar

Correct, and BinHex 4.0 has been adopted as a MIME type:

  application/mac-binhex4.0

What folks are asking is, can PINE detect attachments of this type and 
automatically "de-binhex" 'em (in the same way that base64 encoded 
attachments are decoded).

No way!  I've had success saving attachments to a file then manually 
running mcvert to de-binhex the file (followed by a dd to strip off the 
128-byte Mac header if I wanted to get at the file straight away);  
having to "take it to an Apple Macintosh" is just nowhere near the 
"easiest route", especially when someone is sending me a plain text file, 
or a GIF image that I subsequently want to manipulate under UNIX.

"Okay," I hear, "why don't you just make do with mcvert?"  Partly because 
it's cumbersome, partly because it's *easier* to have the decoding of 
BinHex4.0 files built into PINE (perhaps an option during compile-time) 
for when you're getting PINE up and running on a new machine (os or 
platform - quite common 'round here).

No need for *encoding*, just *decoding*.  Not too much, surely?  :-)

No way - whilst "archives" are often sent around as binhex files, often 
Mac mailers encode single files in binhex, which is real annoying when 
you read your mail on a UNIX box, want to process that single file on 
that same UNIX box, but need to go through some extra step first.

Obviously, if the decoded file is a compressed or self-extracting 
archive, then taking it to a Mac is necessary - but what about everything 
else?  :-(

Just as doco exists covering QP and base64 encoding, doco also exists 
covering BinHex4.0;  surely it wouldn't be too difficult to add it in at 
some stage (decoding only)?  Hmmm .. might poke around with 3.91 later...

Cheers..

hej,
=09Could someone tell me how I could configure lynx and/or the Pine
mailer so they will show the swedish characters proporly.  I have my
computer set to swedish and I would like to be able to see an A (and a
with two dots on it) and the rest when ppl write to me

The letters  "a" with a dot, "a" with two dots  and "o" with two dots
looks like this if I type them, first a capital and then a small one
they are in the order as above:
=C5=E5    =C4=E4    =D6=F6=20

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^< I would like them to show up as the actual letter=20
rather than (for ex) a '*' or a 'A'.

The method would be to send the mail to nobody or yourself, and then to
Bcc it to the list.  You can access Bcc in PINE by hitting <Ctrl>-R in
the message headers section.

    Yup.  From the Pine Main Menu, go into the Addressbook function.  
Type a question mark to get the help screens, which explain about setting 
up distribution lists.

 I've been trying out a Windows based MUA thats works just fine with Pine 
folders and IMAP daemon. It called EMBLA from ICL ProSystems AB in 
Sweden. I bet it handles Swedish characters, it even comes in two 
flavours - English and Swedish. You can get a demo version from 
http://www.pro.icl.se/

You should always have at least one address (even invalid) in the To: or Cc:
headers.  If you don't, sendmail will add Apparently-To: headers for
some number of the recipients.  You don't see these headers in pine,
but you do in other mailer.

I am not sure but if you find out please post it to the newsgroup. 
I have been looking at the pine manual but did not find anything out 
about it.

I know that you can make a list in the address book. It is kinda of a 
mailing list but you need to make the list yourself.

that allow you, for example, to sort local newsgroups to the top of the 
list and, if your server keeps such a file, a list of recently created 
newsgroups.

You can see our newsgroup index at:
	http://www.york.ac.uk/ServerSupport/UsenetNews/

and find the software and description at:
	http://www.york.ac.uk/ftparchive/WWW/utils/hyperactive/

Hyperactive is written using Perl 4.  I have had reports it doesn't work 
properly under Perl 5, but have yet to try it out to see.

(I'll shut up now, as this seems to have wandered off Pine altogether --  
Sorry!)

If your ISP is providing mail by means of SMTP you don't have a mailbox,
on the server machine, like you would with POP3 or IMAP. What is
required is that when you connect to the ISP you have a SMTP daemon
running on you machine when you connect. The ISP should then when it
detects that you have connected to the system send you the mail that is
waiting for you. These mail messages will be deposited in mailboxes on
you local machine, depending on how the SMTP daemon has been configured.
You can then read the mail using pine looking at the local mailboxes.

Nope its nothing to do with that, pine with be attempting to connect to
the IMAPD (or POP3) port and I suspect that there is not a server
running on either port so it is giving connection refused as a result.


Hope this helps

Dear all,

I am having sometimes some difficulties with pine, due to, apparently 
screen editor problems. What is most surprising is that the problem is 
rather erratic...

I am trying to explain the symptoms:

- on MAIN screen, if one tries to move with up-down arrow, the screen text 
goes up one line each time. Hence I end up not knowing where I am. the 
problem can be cured a bit, by typing L (for example) and then M again, 
to get back a nearly neat main screen. But anyway, when arriving in the 
main, it lacks the last line containing the short commands (Send, Justify...)

- In the same way, the messages cannot be read clearly, because they are 
printed on the screen up to the end, and then I can't get back to the 
top (I get the message "already at start of message")

I would like to know if you already experienced this kind of bug, and 
what can be done in order to fix it. What I less understand is that the 
bug is erratic, and that it happens on several computers (I guess all) in 
the center. 

(we have a Unix station, to which are connected the PCs. It seems that 
the problem only arises when working from the PCs).

Sincerely,
-------------

How about implementing some color schemes in an uncoming release of PINE?
Also, what about Extended ASCII characters? I know they display fine 
through dial-ins (modem), but I have yet to find a telnet program that 
displays 8bit characters...

Yves,
I had a similar problem with my communications software.  I fixed this by 
disabling the status and menu lines.

Pine uses 24 lines.  Because my communications software was using two 
lines for status and menu, I had only 23 lines for Pine and the display 
jumped back and forth as I scrolled.

What software are you using to connect to the Unix server?  Is it giving 
you at least 24 lines for your remote session?

Good luck,

Message-Id: <405kr9$2vh@nntpd.lkg.dec.com>


Hi.  Eudora says that they are "compatible with UNIX mail and .mailrc files".
But I find that in a Eudora .mbx file, messages are separated by 
"<CR><NL><CR><NL>", where in Unix (PINE) files messages are separated by
"<NL><NL>".  

Consequently, PINE can't read mail files created by Eudora.  I found that
if I just strip out the extra <CR>s it works fine.  Is there any way to
change PINE's idea of what the inter-message seperator should be ?

Thanks in advance,

In Unix, create a file with a name of .forward with the address you want 
it to go to as the only line, in VAX its set forward "<mail

Just a note:  I won't disagree with the idea of using Windows Terminal ( 
or any other comm software designed to run under Windows);  the reason I 
didn't suggest any Windows-driven software, though, is because through 
working at the Helpdesk here I've seen many many clients experience 
problems of various shapes and sizes when running standard vt100 comm 
software under Windows (including Windows Terminal), and in 90% of cases, 
shutting down Windows and running the comm software from the DOS prompt 
eliminated the problem.  This is not to say that I haven't also seen some 
clients running vt100 comm software successfully in a Windows 
environment, just that the number who had problems is significantly 
high.  Windows 3.1 does not seem to handle communications well in a 
fairly wide variety of circumstances.

I was reading a file and accidently hit ALT-C.  The next thing I knew my 
INBOX had (READONLY) beside it, and when I quit and restarted pine, it 
said something about a lock.  Now I can't delete any files in my inbox.  
What happened and how do I fix it?

I have Pine 3.91 running in an HP-UX 9.01 xterm, and if I invoke pine -k, I 
get the function key menu at the bottom but when I press any function key 
I get a '[Command "D" not defined for this screen. Use F1 for help]'

work so that the function keys are mapped and if so does anybody out 
there have such a file.

Thanks.

If you're on a Unix machine, this needs to be set at your home directory, 
not from Pine...
Create a file in your home directory called      .forward       .  
Contents should consist of a single line, that line being the complete 
e-mail address of where you want to forward your mail...
Save the file;  your incoming mail should then be forwarded to the new 
location...
NOTE:  If your system uses AFS, the following commands need to be issued 
at the system prompt:

cd ~yourid

my screen does have 25 lines, one being used by the system. therfore it 
does remain 24 lines for pine. right now it works perfectly, but this 
morning it did not. I am getting crazy...

I am calling a program called ethdrv to load the ethernet driver then I 
can type telnet myhost. Yes I do have 24 lines, so I feel the bug is 
hidden somewhere else. 

Thank you for your help anyway

   I have downloaded the most recent version of PINE, and cannot get this 
program to compile.  I am trying to compile on a Sparc 10 running Solaris
2.4.  I have tried using the "makefile.sol" and "makefile.sv4" with no luck.
   The errors I keep seeing are identifier redeclared in "stdlib.h" and
"unistd.h".  I also noticed that in the makefile.sol that it doesn't use
the c compiler that came with solaris.  Are there any known compilation
problems with solaris???

P.S.  pico, imapd, and mtest all compiled fine.

                                                    Thankyou,

Yves,

sorry, I didn't recall your first message, but do you use your telnet in a window? If so: Do 
you have a slider at one side for scrolling? I've had such a combination on a Sun and the 
slider interacted with PINE. In some sessions I had this problem. Now I'm using a window 
without a slider and all is well

Ciao,
 Michael Joswig

Message-Id: <408cq5$atl@transfer.stratus.com>

Hi,

I am having some problems with getting PC-Pine to work correctly with the packet
drivers.  I am trying to use the 'slipper' slip driver.  I got the connection
working correctly because I can use the NCSA telnet software and talk to whoever
I want to, but I can not get PC-Pine to work correctly with it.  I verified that
the imap server is working correctly because I tried running pine from Linux (on
the same system) and it worked just fine.

Heres what I did and what happened.

I set my CONFIGTEL environment variable to point to my config.tel file that came
with the NCSA telnet stuff.

I ran PC-Pine.  It comes up into the main menu and asks for a INBOX to open.  I
type in '{my_remote_system}/usr/spool/mail/MAILBOX'.

When I hit enter on this (and answer the question if I want it in the pinerc
file), the transmit light on the modem comes on almost continuous, and a few
blinks come back (via the recieve light), and it sits this way forever.  It never
succeds in opening the mailbox, and I have to reboot to try again.  (can not ^C
or ^BREAK out of it).

Does anyone have any suggestions on where to go from here?  Am I doing something
wrong??

Any responses would be greatly appreciated, either via email or via this news
group.

Thanks, Rick

Thanks for the answer, but this is not what I want. I have set the switch to 
leave read mail on the server. But the mail is not marked as already read. It

again...

You can find many different communication software that _should_ run on
that kind of setup. Off the top of  my head,  you might try looking for
it at any simtel mirrored site. 

ftp:oak.oakland.edu/pub/simtel/msdos/telix/tlx322-*.zip
                                    /qmodem/qm46td-*.zip

I have gotten both these software to work with my 286/10 at home with 1
meg of RAM. Hope this helps. Let us know how it worked out.

	I've compiled on Solaris 2.4.  You should check/do the following:

1.	Ensure that /usr/opt/SUNWspro/bin appears in your path before
	/usr/ucb.

2.	Ensure that the LD_LIBRARY_PATH does *not* included 
	/usr/ucb/lib.

3.	In the makefile.sol in pine add -Dconst= to the CFLAGS
	definition.

4.	Then do the build.

I figured out how to do it - by adding the value to customized headers, 
but is there any way to make the value of the reply-to header default, so 
I don't have to add my address to that field every time.

Hi

1.  I have setup .forward with receiving address, but mail is not forwarded.

2.  Playing around with procmail and .forward to sort messages (as
described in FAQs) also does not work.  My mail seems to disappear. 

Any obvious (or not so obvious) suggestions?  I'm on Alpha with OSF/1 
using Pine as mail program.  I believe PMDF (?) is earlier part of mail 
delivery.

I've been lurking watching for an answer to an oft-asked question:

How do you import a list of internet addresses into a Pine Addressbook 
"distribution list" without retyping them all?

Come on, _SOMEONE_ must have the answer...!

I've just tried to use PC pine to connect to my mail server (which use
PINE 3.91). It failed to login, with message BAD Login. When I tried to
use root as username, it works fine.

My mail server using sendmail (instead of mmdf) and C2 security features 
from SCO. I wonder whether these cause the problem.

I try to use either root and NOLUID in /etc/inetd.conf for imapd, and try 
to use different combinations of owner and group for imapd. 

Is there anyone could give me any suggestions or know where I could find 
any FAQ for imapd.

Thanks and Regards

It means your computer is using a broken version of the "sendmail" system 
program, and should get the latest version.

The background...

A(nother) security hole was discovered in the "sendmail" mail delivery 
system and a fixed version was released.  Unfortunately it broke another 
area, causing sendmail (not Pine) to core dump when sending to more than 
a number of people (I think it was 20-ish).

The problem is fixed in the 8.6.12 release of sendmail.

Pause and think carefully for a moment ...

[I'm assuming you're using the UNIX version of Pine by running a terminal 
emulator on your micro to connect to and login to a UNIX computer..]

You are logged in to UNIX, using UNIX commands, using files stored on the 
UNIX computer's disk.  Forgetting about Pine for a moment, can you see 
any of the files on your micro's own hard disk directly from UNIX?  Or do 
you have to transfer (Kermit/whatever) them to UNIX first?

If you can't "see" your micro's own files from UNIX (and, unless you're 
running some really funny setup you won't be able to) then Pine (which is 
just another UNIX program) won't be able to see them either.

So in order to attach a file to a message sent using *UNIX* Pine does 
indeed require the file to be accessible (usually stored on) the UNIX 
computer.

If you use the PC a lot you may like to think about getting hold over the 
PC/Windows version of Pine to use instead?  (Saves logging in to UNIX 
and *can* then send PC files (as it's running on the PC).  Can also send 
UNIX files if (and only if) the UNIX filestore is mounted (perhaps over 
PC-NFS or equivalent) on the PC.)

I did it by using Pine to create a minimal addressbook containing a 
couple of single entries, and a couple of distribution list entries.

Then I looked at the resulting ".addressbook" file in my UNIX home 
directory and guessed the format of the file.  (It is *very* 
straightforward!)

Then, because I only had relatively few addresses in my previous mail 
utility's list, took a copy of the file and edited it into the right 
form.  For more I'd have probably knocked up a little script to do it.

You don't say what mailer your previous address book is for, but if it's 
Elm then there is already a conversion script available called something 
like "elm2pine".  (Perhaps someone can say where to find it?  I did a 
quick check of ftp.cac.washington.edu, but couldn't spot it)

There's also a shell script within the Pine distribution for converting 
.mailrc addresses into a Pine addressbook:

	contrib/utils/brk2pine.sh

I normally access pine via telnet to a SUN unix system, which is in the
middle of a Solaris1 (4.1.3) to Solaris2 (2.3) conversion. I have just
converted myself to logging on to the Solaris 2 side, and have noticed a
problem with shell escape (^-Z). The escape itself usually works fine, and
I can happily obey commands, but when exiting the escape (using the fg
command) Pine exits back to the shell prompt. A little while later a
message appears:-

Pine finished. Error reading from terminal: I/O error

(Sometimes, just trying to escape with ^-Z causes pine to drop out, and 
this time there is no "explanatory" message).

I suspect that one of the stty settings may be wrong, though they are the 
same as for the Solaris 1 system, where shell escape works fine.

Any advice?

The stty settings are:-

speed 38400 baud; -parity
swtch = <undef>;
brkint -inpck -istrip icrnl -ixany imaxbel onlcr tab3
echo echoe echok echoctl echoke iexten

Is it possible to have more than one personal name (not the correct

my "real" email address? For example, my login name is cdh, but my
published address for our company (and what is on my business cards)
is chalverson. I also have chrish, halverson, etc. I would like Pine
to be able to recognize those addresses as coming to me so that the
"+" would show in the index (and so it would not ask if I want to
reply to all recipients). 

Is this possible? If so, how? Thanks for any responses.

I like the feature of pine that mail with your FROM address is listed as 
"TO: user@address".  This is especially helpful in the "sent-mail" folder.  
However, this does not seem to work for news posts?  Is there a way to 
have a similar feature where posts would look like "TO: newsgroup"?

I have Pine 3.91 running in an HP-UX 9.01 xterm, and if I invoke pine -k, I 
get the function key menu at the bottom but when I press any function key 
I get a '[Command "D" not defined for this screen. Use F1 for help]' 
error in the status line. Do I need a special X Resource file for this to 
work so that the function keys are mapped and if so does anybody out 
there have such a file.

Thanks.

Subject: Pine, ispell integration 
Message-Id: <Pine.HPP.3.91.950809142057.1655A-100000@huhc06>

If anybody is interested I have integrated ispell into Pine as the 
primary spell checker (CTRL-T) using the suggestion in the FAQ that to 
make ispell work you define your alternate editor as ispell and then use 
the CTRL-_ key binding to invoke the spell checker.  What I did was strip 
down the function alt_editor() and call it ispell() and change the 
binding of CTRL-T to call ispell().  I then defined the SPELLER as isepll 
and took out a couple of things.  So far it will only compile as ispell - 
you don't have a choice during the make between ispell and spell.  Now you 
can have both an alternate editor and ispell and the user doesn't have 
to know how to invoke ispell.

If there is enough interest I will make the diffs into a patch and post 
it somewhere (suggestions ?) for anyone else who wants it.

BTW my system is HP-UX 9.01 7xx but it should work with any UNIX. 

It also works with the pico editor stand alone, as this is where the code 
was located.

This works for me:
customized-hdrs=Reply-to:llb@getinc.com

I just added the value on the RHS of the ":" and pine seems to read
and parse it just fine.  I've also added subsequent headers by
using a "," with no spaces around it and no spaces in the header or
default value.  I don't haven't ever tried assigning default values
that contain spaces.

I like the feature of pine that mail with your FROM address is listed as
"TO: user@address".  This is especially helpful in the "sent-mail" 
folder.  However, this does not seem to work for news posts?  Is there a
way to have a similar feature where posts would look like "TO: newsgroup"? 

Thanks.

We are using IDA sendmail, dated 3/24/94 (I don't know the verion number),
on an HP running 9.01.  We have installed PINE 3.91 and pop/imap mail. 
Sendmail is creating, over time, a large number of defunct sendmail
processes some how related to imapd.  These processes fill the process
table and kill the server. 

Does anyone have any idea how I can fix this problem.  Right now I have a
cron job killing and starting sendmail every 15 min. to clean out the
process table.

Thanks for your help!

Hello All!
I'm having a problem getting INN and Pine to work together. I think that 
I have everything set right but whenever I try to read my newsgroups thru 
pine I get either not articles exist (which I know they do thru using 
trn) or articles that say "no text..." (which I also know to be wrong 
thru trn). Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I have a couple of questions to ask concerning Pine. (I'm using v3.91)

* Is there a FAQ available? If there is, where can it be found?

* Is there some way you can make pine "sort out" messages from one or 
  several adresses, and put them in a folder different than INBOX? Would 
  be very handy when u're participating in several mailing lists and 
  everything gets messed in the inbox.

Thanks for your time, and I hope someone knows the answers to theese 
questions!

Uhm, I thought that's what I said:

Bcc: (list)

I am very confused by this report.

imapd does not use the root password; in fact, it is impossible to log
into imapd as root or any other UID 0 user name.

In order for imapd to process logins, it must be run by inetd with the
following access:
	1) it must be able to read passwords (whether from /etc/passwd
	   or from a shadow password file)
	2) it must be able to execute the setuid() and setgid() calls.

This usually means that imapd needs to be run as root by inetd.  imapd
will discard its root access as part of the login process, so there is no
security problem by doing this.

I try to use pc pine to connect to our mail server (using pine 3.91), via
imap2 port.

It only works by using root password.

We are using C2 security features from SCO. This will run imapd with
NOLUID (set in /etc/inetd.conf).

Is there anybody ever set this up, or have any idea for me to be tried.

Thanks and Best Regards

Have you set your the permission of .forward to 711 using chmod?
This is necessary to allow others (including software) to access the file for

Pine will allow you to create the folders to do this but won't actually 
do the sorting. You have to use a program like procmail or filter. 
Filter usually comes with the elm distribution and procmail you can get from 
ftp://ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/pub/packages/procmail

Over 99% of the mail messages sent by our users are intra-domain:  from
one site in our company's domain to another.  Because our logins are
centrally administered, we know authoritatively whether a mailing address
in our own domain is valid.  It would be really nice for our users if Pine
could check these addresses *before* the message is sent.

If they have to wait for the mail system to send them a "not deliverable" 
notice, they may not catch a mis-typed address until the next time they 
check their mail.  Even worse, if the typo is on a Cc: address, then 
every reply to their message will also generate an error.

(We'd have no trouble writing the program that actually does the 
verification; all we need is for Pine to be able to connect to it.  
Almost any interface would work for us: running a program, connecting to 
a network port, issuing a Sendmail VRFY command, ....)

Is anything like this planned for a future release?

Subject: nulls in spool file, Pine ignores message

We're having a problem periodically where sendmail writes a message to a
spool file where the From line is preceeded with a series of nulls. This
causes Pine to not see the beginning of the new message so it gets lost at
the end of the previous message. The UCB mail program handles it okay and
just opening and saving the spool file with mail will remove the nulls. Is
this problem known and, if so, is there a fix? Much appreciated!

PS: I've not been following pine-info lately. I apologize if this issue has
been dealt with earlier.

Hi,

I am using Pine 3.91 since 1 year and I still have a problem I can
solve. It's about 'From:' field in outgoing mail. This one contains
the hostname of my mail exchanger, 'Pinuche' :
login@Pinuche.grbb.polymtl.ca. I would like to get just the domainame
: login@grbb.polymtl.ca. I have correctly configured my sendmail.cf on
my hosts in order to remove hostname from 'From:' when using 'mail' or
'Mail' but with pine, I still have this problem. However, I have the
lines in pine.conf :

user-domain=grbb.polymtl.ca
use-only-domain-name=no

I tried to use :
user-domain=
use-only-domain-name=yes 

but with no more success. I checked that my .pinerc doesn't have
another configuration.

Any idea about this problem ?

Thanks in advance for your help.				 Gildas.

Message-Id: <s5u3ff93agn.fsf@coil.nist.gov>

Howdy.

I use pine for previewing and quick-handling of my email deluge, and a
more automatable email interface (emacs vm) for systematic foldering,
folder perusal, etc.  (Work dynamics as they are, i wind up using pine
predominantly.)  My problem is that pine more-than-occasionally
rejects vm folders for saves.

Now, vm is supposed to be rfc822 compliaint, but even if it's not
perfectly so, i wish pine would let me append rfc822-formed messages
in a file when i wish to do so!  (I realize that i can use 'export',
but it loses information.  And besides, it doesn't do completion - i
hope that's being corrected in the next release! - which makes the
foldering process much more clunky...)  So i request relaxation of the
constraints on folder type for saves - require existence of the
folder, and some basic mail-folder characteristics requirements, but
don't be so stringent that mail-like folders are rejected.

And btw, any word about when some patches and/or a new version might
appear?  I took a quick look at the code, but couldn't even locate
significant portions of the "Unable to append mail to file" message,
to find the relevant code to make the change myself.  (And what i
could track down did not look trivial...)

I believe that C2 uses Shadow passwords.  As far as I've ever seen, Pine 
won't use Shadow passwords on SCO.  This may not be the problem, but it 
seems likely to me.  Try telnetting into the IMAP port and having the 
dialog by hand, so you can see the errors directly.

When I send mail to a listserv that I am subscribed to, my posts are not
identified by my name.  The FROM line just says To:idm@hyperreal.com. 
When I send messages to individuals, it identifies me accurately in the
FROM line.

I'm not sure which pine setup file to change to fix this problem.  Any
help will  be appreciated.

We believe that this problem will be fixed in Pine 3.92.  If you are in a
hurry, you can get the very latest
	ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap-3.6.BETA.tar.Z
and rebuild Pine 3.92 using the IMAP 3.6 beta toolkit instead of the IMAP
3.5 that was distributed with Pine 3.91.

Don't use the IMAP 4 alpha toolkit; Pine doesn't build with it yet.

I just put in code from the IMAP 4 alpha toolkit into the IMAP 3.6 beta
toolkit that should nuke the last vestiges of this problem.  Previous
versions of the IMAP 3.6 beta toolkit fixed most occurances, but there was
still a hole through which a few insects should slip through.

My subject says it all, but it isn't consistent.  Messages from one 
mailing list in particular (not a listserv) never bounce to where I send 
them; rather, they embarrasingly go back to the list!

If someone would like to take a look at a few offending message header

bounce, of that you can be sure ;-)

That error message indicates that you attempted to append a message to a
file that is not in any recognized mail box file format.  The format of
mail box files is not specified by any RFC, and more likely than not emacs
vm has its own ideosyncratic format that is not known to Pine.

Since Pine does not know what format the mail box file is in, it does not
know what format in which to write the message.

You would probably be very upset if Pine were to write a message to an
executable binary file, or to a shell script, because you mistyped a name.
You'd also be upset if Pine were to write a message to a vm mail box file
using some other mail box format (meaning that vm wouldn't recognize it as
a message).

I hope that you now recognize that a "relaxation of the constrains of
folder type for saves" is not what you want.

If you want to write to an arbitrary file, the command to use is Export;
if you want to write to vm folders, you either need to tell vm to use the
standard Unix mail box format or you need to write a c-client driver to
support the vm format.  A typical c-client driver is
	pine3.91/imap/ANSI/c-client/bezerk.[ch]
You basically need to copy this code, change all occurances of the string
"bezerk" to "vm", then change the code to read/write vm format instead of
Unix format.  Not for the faint-hearted.

Dear Gildas,
go to the Setup (press S on the Main Menu page) and then Configuration 
(press C). If the second line down says:
user-domain            = <Value is Fixed: using "Pinuche.grbb.polymtl.ca">
Then this is a sys-admin defined value and you cannot change it even if 
you change the .pinerc file.
Having said that, I have just glanced up at your "From :" and it says:
From: Gildas PERROT <perrot@grbb.polymtl.ca>
How are you seeing if the "Pinuche" is still being added, by sending mail 
to yourself? Try sendiing it to a friend instead.
Mickey

Hi,

I have been using pine for a while now, including using short distribution 
lists - I've been very impressed with the reliability. However, when I 
try to use a new distribution list I have, with 80 addresses on it, the
mail does not get sent and I get no error messages.

In .pine-debug1 the mail is flagged "SUCCESSFUL", but in the sendmail log
there is just the line 

sendmail locked

which looks bad. Unfortunately there's noone here with the expertise to
go any further into the problem.

(Incidentally the problem is not with any of the addresses on the list. 
When I break it up into 5 smaller lists, they work fine)

Many thanks for any help or clues,

Cheers,
Jon

Hi

Is it possible in Pine to have a remote news feed for newsgroups and a 
local site for local groups?  If so I would appreciate hearing from 
someone with such a setup about what is required on the local site and 
how users should configure Pine.

Take care
Jim

Date: 11 Aug 95 15:02:07 GMT
Message-Id: <gdoucett.808153327@pX1.stfx.ca>

We've setup PC-PINE v3.91 for DOS Packet Drivers on a Novell 
server which services many students on several IP subnets 
attached to a cisco router.

The problem is that from areas not on the same subnet as the Novell
Server a connection can't be made to the UNIX system which is the 
IMAP Server.  I think the Nearest IP Gateway is the problem.  We use
NCSA Telnet with one CONFIG.TEL, but PC-PINE seems to want the gateway
to point to the correct subnet instead of ARPing for an address.

Any ideas?  I have not read the FAQ.  Is there one, and where is it?
How does the TCP in Pine handle Nearest gateway addresses?

Many Thanks,
Gary

hi

has anyone built Pine 3.91 (or just a bit prior) for SCO unix that has

c-client for /usr/spool/mail/XXXX and MMDF ONLY.  

please email replies!

I can't seem to get our domain name appended to the X-Sender: line, and
it also doesn't appear in the Message-ID:, as you can see below.

The From: line is fine, and sendmail seems to be behaving itself with
all other mail clients on the system. This is Pine 3.91 on a Next.

Are either of these going to cause problems, or is this strictly a
cosmetic issue?

Any hints greatly appreciated.

Subject: Pine startup question
Date: 11 Aug 1995 09:17:20 -0700
Message-Id: <40fvqg$t69@kaiwan009.kaiwan.com>

I just got done compiling pine 3.91 on HP-UX using gcc and it behaves
a little differently than the version on my internet service provider.
The ISP copy startup and goes to the main menu, while my freshly
compiled version immediately goes to the INBOX folder.  How can I get
pine to go to the main menu upon startup?

"Locking" is so non-trivial that I suggest to either set up a mailing list
or create a local newsgroup.  You could also make the mail folder available
as a web page but then everybody *could* read it.  Oh, well.
Anyway, if you're only *reading* from the same folder then there should be no
problem.  YOu only need locking if new mail will be put into the folder.

Dumb question!  It was in the Pine Technical Notes page 46.
But now I have the problem that when I do use function keys, and I go 
into the setup menu, the F4 (Newpassword) and F5 (Config) choices beep at 
me with no error message, but the others work (Update Cancel Printer and 
Help) all work with the function keys. Also F4 and F5 seem to work 
everywhere else.

Pine 3.91 HPUX 9.01 7XX.
Thanks for any help.

HI
  i have the FREE AGENT newsreader system and it is quite easy...and
seems to have all of the basics put on an icon bar. i have used it for
a week now and love it...just one question though...in looking over
the newsgroups it seems the system saves the articles in my computer's
harddrive.  i wish to purge them but every time i do what seems to be
the most logical way to do this...clck on the purge articles option i
go back and see all of the old articles when i want to only see the
new unread articles.  any idea how to solve my little problem???   joe

You could have two news-collections, one local and one remote.  As long as
there is no overlap in the newsgroup names you should not have any
problem...

Mime-Version: 1.0

Problem:

We have the pine.conf* files set up with an NNTP-SERVER and then various 
news collections. One of those news collections is for a news host other 
than our NNTP-SERVER (our NNTP-SERVER happens to be a remote machine, 
while the aforementioned news collection is set to our local machine). 
Now, when we subscribe to one of the newsgroups in the "local" 
collection, everything is fine. It sees the proper list. However, once an 
attempt is made to POST to this "local" newsgroup, an error message 
that looks something like 'ERROR 441: Unable to post to newsgroup 
"(null)"' is sent to us and the post fails. We want to be able to read 
AND post from/to _both_ servers, and were wondering if anyone could 
explain what the problem is.

Possible Troubleshooting:

We have examined our local "inn" and "innd" programs to see if they are 
configured properly. As far as we know, they are, but they might not be.

We might have confliction between pine.conf and pine.conf.fixed, although 
we were very careful.

Does Pine allow you to post/read from more than one server? Please help 
us with this.

Thank you,

And imagine all the sleep I'd loose knowing that anyone with access to
my account (by cracking my password or with privledge) could send mail
authenticated as me, and decrypt all my mail sent to me (and probably
all the files I encrypted if it's integrated well).

No thanks.  I would support something that allowed me to specify if
I wanted it signed, then asked for my passphrase.  I would support 
something that verfied signatures on signed mail received by me and 
told me it was valid.

But, I don't want anything signing things automatically, or decrypting
automatically, that just causes it to loose it's significance.

Actually, a collegue of mine here wrote some shell scripts and a 
.forward filter that will perform all of this automatically, without
the use of mkpgp.

I recently sent an e-mail to eleven people.  To avoid revealing their

I also Bcc'ed myself, as I usually do when I send an important message.  
However, I received only one message in my mailbox.  I never received the 
Bcc I sent myself.  Shouldn't I have received two copies of the message?  
Your e-mail response is appreciated.  Thanks.

See if the following is of any help to you:

To see a list of all available language sets on gpu, type   =20
locale -a       at the gpu sustem prompt. =20

Modify .pinerc to include the proper ISO-nnnn-n string in the=20
character-set       option.

Then put the following in the bottom of your .cshrc file:

setenv LANG xx_xx

ie      setenv LANG sv_SE

Then logout and log back in. Then either find an article in the desired=20
language to display, or create a piece of mail to yourself and try to=20
look at it.

We've successfully used the above method here for both the French and=20
Swedish language sets, so far...

Your /etc/hosts.txt -- or, since you are on a NeXT, your NetInfo database
-- is incorrectly configured.  Look at the entry for the local host.  You
will see that "rosebud" appears before "rosebud.ldp.com".  You need to
reverse the order so that the full name appears first.

PS: I forgot to answer this.

It is strictly a cosmetic issue.  The X-Sender header is not an official
header, and is not subject to any rules.

The rules for the Message-ID header specify that the token to the right of
the "@" be a what RFC-822 calls a "domain".  This has misled some people
into thinking that a fully-qualified name must be specified, but in
reality it a since word without any dots is valid.

Some of the the allegedly misled people were actually wondering how one
can ensure the required uniqueness of a Message-ID that has a simple
hostname on the right of the @ sign instead of a fully qualified domain
name.

	To quote RFC-822

     4.6.1.  MESSAGE-ID / RESENT-MESSAGE-ID

             This field contains a unique identifier  (the  local-part
        address  unit)  which  refers to THIS version of THIS message.
        The uniqueness of the message identifier is guaranteed by  the
        host  which  generates  it.  This identifier is intended to be
        machine readable and not necessarily meaningful to humans.   A
        message  identifier pertains to exactly one instantiation of a
        particular message; subsequent revisions to the message should
        each receive new message identifiers.

	unquote.

	It says *nothing* about world uniqueness.  Note also the phrase
"refers to *THIS* version of *THIS* message".  In never states anything
about *ALL* messages.

	Indeed, later in the RFC this example is given:

     Message-ID: <4231.629.XYzi-What@Other-Host>

	I would think this should clear up any misunderstanding.

	Regards,

I believe that the BNF, which includes the line:

   msg-id      =  "<" addr-spec ">"            ; Unique message id

settles the issue. 

1. The comment 'Unique message id' is clear.  

2. It is clearly the intent of RFC822 that any message crossing domain
   boundaries should use a sufficiently qualified domain name in the
   addr-spec.  I see no exception to this rule for message-ids.

I have to choose between elm and pine
for a large (180) freshman class next year.

What are the merits and demerits of these rivals ?

Neither seems to come with very good documentation.
[I'd prefer something in texinfo format, given a choice.]
Is there any independent documentation available?

What are the relative usages of the two ?
Are both reasonably certain to survive ?

Any and all opinions gratefully received.

Stan, you need to put the NNTP setup in the PINE Config file.  At the 
Main Menu, hit S for Setup and C for Config.  Then put the name of your 
news server where it says NNTP-Server.  (If you don't know what it is, 
ask your system administrator.)  And while you're in the config file, you 
might as well make and X where it says "enable expanded view of 
folders" and "enable aggregate commands," both of which will save you time 
when you use Pine as a newsreader.

	Sure.....if you don't read and understand the rest of the RFC.

	Anyway, this is not a pine issue, more like an ietf-822 issue
....so off pine list.

	I wouldn't have put this on the pine list either...but my

I have to choose between elm and pine
for a large (180) freshman class next year.

What are the merits and demerits of these rivals ?

Neither seems to come with very good documentation.
[I'd prefer something in texinfo format, given a choice.]
Is there any independent documentation available?

What are the relative usages of the two ?
Are both reasonably certain to survive ?

Any and all opinions gratefully received.

--------------------
Personally, I prefer pine!
I've been using both for quite a while and IMHO it's much easier to use pine.
However, using elm, you can (for example) "read" MIME attachments without down
loading the stuff.. with pine you have to write it in a file first.
Hard to say which one is better... both have their positive and negative sides!

I just got my setup right.  Try putting an X in the block.

      [X]  news-approximates-new-status      
      [X]  news-post-without-validation      
      [X]  news-read-in-newsrc-order

Good luck.  


BTW, what kind of Amiga are you on and where can I get a copy of AmigaMosaic?

I use Pine 3.91 (or try to) with 2 different servers. The one from which 
I am sending this is a freenet, and I have no problems with Pine here. 
The other is a relatively new commercial server, and when I use Pine on 
it everything is highlighted, and I can't tell where I am.

The system administrator claims that the problem is at my end, but I'm
quite sure it isn't for 3 reasons. One is that Pine works great from my 
other server. Two is that the problem appears on 2 different comm 
programs I've tried. Three is that the same problem occurs regardless of 
whether I'm using my computer at home or the one at the office.

You may wonder why I don't just use the freenet all the time, but I get a 
busy signal about 95% of the time when I try to connect. I am going to be 
using e-mail for business purposes and I need to have both a reliable 
connection and an e-mail program (preferably Pine) which works right. 

Please send responses by mail. I'll read them at 2 a.m. when I'm able to 
connect.

Use whichever one is easier to support.  I have found that pine
is better than elm for neophytes, as they usually need to be
retrained after taking a lunch break.

Besides, Pine Is Neo-logistically Elm.

Subject: IMAP & sun-mailtool
Date: 13 Aug 1995 17:55:14 +0200
Message-Id: <40l792$9k6@helka.iif.hu>

I use both IMAP & sun-mailtool. Sometimes when I receive a message
sent with mailtool and I read it with IMAP, it will be separated in
2 or more parts.

For example when I forward a message with mailtool, the message will 
contain the following 3 lines (approx):

----- Begin Included Message -----
 
>From sztaki!FlashBack.com!flash Tue Feb  7 16:09 MET 1995

IMAP will cut the message into 2 messages, though with mailtool
I could read the message as one. The problem is more annoying,
because after only visiting (and not reading) the message with
IMAP, mailtool becomes also unable to read the message correctly.

I think, mailtool uses one of the headers Content-Length or
X-Lines, to recognize, that this is one message, rather than two.

Is this a known compatibility problem? Is there a fix for it?
I tried Keith Moore's sun-to-mime program to resolve this problem,
but it didn't work.

thanx a lot for any answer in advance,

Your IMAP server don't support that mailbox format where "From " -lines are
not escaped. Instead there is Content-Length -header, which tells lenght
of body of mail in mailbox in bytes.

Yes, you have compatibility problem between your local mailer and IMAP server.
(Your local mailer does actual delivery to mailbox.)

No, as i tried to say, pine accepts the majority of folder i create using 
pine.  However, it does not accept a few, and those few totally disrupt 
my efforts to do my "foldering" from pine.  Morever, those few that it 
rejects are readable using, eg, Unix mail, and maybe even Pine itself!

I realized that, which is why i was asking for relaxation, and not 
elimination, of the constraints!  If you like, i can try to create, and 
post, a small mail folder which pine rejects for foldering, but which, eg 
unix mail *and* pine accept for reading as mail folders.

Rather, i think you misapprehended what i was requesting!  I was aware of 
the usefulness of rejecting unrelated folders!

Is there any way in pine to post a mail message to a Usenet
Newsgroup rather than exporting it and then posting the
contents of the resulting file?

I've read that Procmail can be used as a delivery filter with Pine.  I've
found Procmail but can do nothing with it.  I have decompressed it but now
all I have is a 660KB(+/-) "Procmail" file.

I've looked for help files at several WWW locations but all I find
mentions the fact that Procmail can be used with Pine...but none explain
how to set it up in my UNIX home directory...basicly I have no clue on
what to do with it or how to set it up. 

If anyone can offer me directions to resources or help files (or just a
clue) - I'll greatly appreciate it.

Thank you,

Instead of just adding a system call to the pgp program from within PINE 
(the new version that is, 3.92?) it would be really nice if there was an 
option during compilation to fully integrate PGP into the PINE program. 
This way PGP encryption would be done completely in the background, and 
the keys etc signatures could be parsed out on the fly and not be 
displayed at all by default. In this way PGP would appear completely 
transparent.

Does anyone know whether it is possible to change the number of
columns - some of my mails get messed up by other systems -
I'd like to get it down to around 65 or so.

Thanks for any help.

Hi, I am new to the pine, so lots of stuff there I am not 
familiar, especially the MIME part. 

Can anybody tell me how to send a variety of MIME mail instead of
just "Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN", for example, can I send a "text/html"
mail, so that when others read this mail, it will automatically pop up
a mosaic or netscape browser to let others read the mail contents?

Thanks in advance!

Currently not possible in pine-3.91 but will supposedly be available
in the next release.

An alternative is to use the alternate editor feature and use an
editor where you can control the number of columns.  Works like a
charm.

Hi, I am new to the pine, so lots of stuff there I am not
familiar, especially the MIME part.

Can anybody tell me how to send a variety of MIME mail instead of
just "Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN", for example, can I send a "text/html"
mail, so that when others read this mail, it will automatically pop up
a mosaic or netscape browser to let others read the mail contents?

Thanks in advance!

Fellow Pine users,

After some frustrating months of tracking down runaway Pine processes each
day and killing them by hand, I decided to find and fix the cause of the
problem in the Pine sources.

Some debugging revealed that the hanging Pines are doing a tight loop
in read_with_timeout().  The logic in this function is slightly awry;
it does not cater for read(terminal) returning zero bytes.  My patch is at
the end of this message;  it's a one-line fix.  Not one Pine has run away
since I patched them a week ago.  Before I patched Pine, I was getting
about one runaway Pine per day per machine on average.

I saw the problem only with Pine 3.91.  Pine 3.89, which we still use
on some of our machines, has never runaway on us.  Pine 3.91 was running
away on both Solaris 2.3 and 2.4.

If there are any Pine developers reading this, perhaps you could fix the
bug in the next release of Pine.

Cheers for now,
Sean.

Well, I mentioned this before, but I hope the integration isn't too
seamless.

The problem with seamless integration is that it causes one to loose
all the benefits of having a pass phrase in the first place.  
Digital signatures are only meaningful if you can guarantee that 
the person sending the message is the person who signed it.  If I have
a program that automatically signs my mail, then if I leave my terminal
unattended or if someone guesses my password to my account (something that
is limited to 8 characters on my Unix account) then I'm hosed.  All they
have to do is send mail, and poof, my signature appears.

That's not the functionality I'm looking for.  And if it automatically
decrypts items that are encrypted with my public key.  That's even worse.

Just my $0.02 worth.  I'll now get off my soapbox.  You may return
to your regularily scheduled program.

Is there a way to run a text tab/space cleanup operation?
This function would go through and optimize the file by replacing spaces
with tabs, packing them in...

Also, is there an option to set the tab size when you view a document
with tabs in it?

You probably hold in your hands now something that is commonly known as
a "tar" file ("man tar" for details).

To unpack this tar file, you could use something like:

	tar xvf procmail.tar

Once you've done that, start reading the README and INSTALL files.

If I will be unable to check my email for a couple of weeks - is there a way to tell
pine to respond to every mail I receive with a short note, saying how long I don't read 
my mail?

Thanks for your help.

No,  but you can tell Unix to do that with a .vaction file

HOWEVER!  Please don't do this, I believe every message you get from 
the pine-info list will result in a message to the list that you are on 
vacation, which will result in a message to the list that you are on
vacation, which will result in a message to the list that you are on
vacation, which will result in a message to the list that you are on
vacation, which will result in a message to the list that you are on
vacation, which will result in a message to the list that you are on
....

Or you could unsubscribe from the list while you are away and then set up 
your vacation message.

Have a good vacation.

	Looking at the man page for vacation:

     No message is sent if the To:  or the  Cc:   line  does  not
     list  the  user to whom the original message was sent or one
     of a number of aliases for them, if the  initial  From  line
     includes  the  string -REQUEST@, or if a Precedence: bulk or
     Precedence: junk line is included in the header.

	On good lists, pine being one of them, your name will not 
appear in the To: or Cc: which should prevent vacation messages going
to the list.  In addition, vacation will keep track of who it sent
a notification to and will not send another notification until a
predetermined time interval has expired.

	So, it is generally safe to use vacation without unsubscribing
to the many lists for which you have subscriptions.

	Regards,

				Ed

Thanks, Ed.  I've been afraid to use .vacation, since I've seen some 
vacation messages distributed through a couple of lists.  Those 
vacationers must be using a substandard mailer. <g>

    An alternative, if it is available to you, is to use procmail.  You 
can set up filtering recipes which will ignore any postings from mailing 
lists and only send a vacation message to what is left.  You can fine 
tune it to any degree desired.  If formail is also installed on 
your system (this assumes you are using Unix, by the way), you can 
even set things up so that any given sender receives only one 
vacation notification.  However, I must admit that using procmail is 
not entirely trivial.

    This whole queston is not really a Pine question at all, but it, as 
well as incoming mail filtering questions, comes up so often that I think 
it would be helpful if a FAQ could be posted periodically to deal with 
them.  (No, I am not in a position to write such a FAQ -- I currently 
have other irons in the fire.)

  I changed my localhost back to "localhost"  on a TIA to see if I can

Most Mail Transports are smart enough to realize that your address was
listed twice and only deliver one copy, so this is expected behavior...

    What version of Pine are you using?  I post directly to Usenet 
newsgroups all the time directly from the 'compose' or 'reply' functions 
with Pine 3.91.  I think this capability may not have been present in 
earlier versions of Pine.

Huh?  Pine should be able to read any almost valid MIME attachment without
downloading.  What kind of attachments are you having trouble with?

I have seen this problem when the TERM environment variable was set to a
broken driver on a Linux box.  Changing to something else "fixed" the
problem...

I am looking for other family members around the world. The earliest 
reference I have is that my Grandfather, Ludovico, or Lodovico, PRINA 
was one of the sculptors who worked with Bartholdi in Paris on the 
Statue of Liberty and that he came to the U.S.A. 1884-1886 to assist 
in its erection and construction.
He returned to Italy to bring his wife Angelina CRAVELLO Prina to the 
U.S.A. to live. I believe he was either born or at one time lived in 
Veglia, IT. and there is reason to believe he was also associated with 
Lyon, probably France.
My Grandmother Angelina was born and raised in Biela, IT, 18 Km from the 
Great St Bernard Pass between Italy and France.
If anyone named PRINA is ralated to a PRINA who worked on the Statue of 
Liberty we are related also. If your name is not PRINA but you know 
someone named PRINA, please ask if they know if any of their relatives 
worked with Bartholdi. I believe that fact would be of sufficient 
interest for families to remember and pass on to the next generation.
He also had 5, 6 or 7 statues of his own work erected in Northern Italy. 
I have no information about my Grandmother prior to her my childhood, 
which would be in the early 1930's.
Any help? Frank R Prina, 119 Woodward Avenue, Springville, NY, 14141, USA.

3.91 but we must be configured differently. If I reply to a
mail message, it asks if there are both "From" and
"Reply-To", but "help" says that it wants a legitimate
e-mail address in the "To". 

How do you get around that??

Thanks.  I've tracked the offending format down - pine requires the date
number on the first line of the file to occupy two spaces, even when it's
a single digit date.  (Most mail folder-ers pad the date with a space, but
one that i used at least in 1992 did not, causing my problem.) The
attachment contains an example of this.  SunOS 4 bin/mail and ucb/mail,
and SunOS 5 mailx, all accept it without blinking. 

I do recommend relaxing the pine mailbox criterion, to at least allow this
variance, and even more.  Personally, i expect that just requiring a
leading "From " at the very beginning of the file would be sufficient to
weed out the non-mail files, particularly if there actually is no formal
standard for unix-mail format files - i suspect that's a commonly used
criterion.

Cool.  (I presume the export command will be getting completion, and i'd 
also like to suggest having the expunge-confirmation come *before* the 
quit confirmation, when exiting with `no-quit-without-confirm' set.)

Thanks for taking a look at this.

Is there a way that you can set the system mailbox so that users get their 
mail in their home directories?  I am not talking jsut about pine (I can 
set that through the conf files), but also ipop and imap.  I have tried 
setting the SYSTEM_MBOX (?) in the c-client/osdep.h file, but it does not 
seem to work.  How do I do this?  Or where do I look?  I have looked 
through the documentation, but maybe I just missed it.  TIA

  Maybe I should ask my netserver galactica.it, but they are on vacation.
  And they give Eudora to all...and I am running Amiga.......Well I left
  inbox-path "inbox" so as not to connect right away...since when I try
  {192.106.152.1}inbox  I get a 192.106.152.1,143 doesn't accept the con-
  nection...Now I get my mail QWKed to me and that is okay for now.

  Galactica.it is a PC bbs and they use ms dos & windows software to
  give you an idea...What is the usual mail procedure SMTP which I
  have installed with my NNTP?...is the 143 indicating that...I also
  have Pop3 installed. Is my "{192.106.152.1}inbox" OK. Also Galactica
  connects use to SLIP via TIA...and I found out that to have NNTP
  work on pine, I had to keep my localhost name "localhost".

  And that is why I put user-domain with my email address so it would
  be somewhere in the header.

  If anyone could help me I would greatly appreciate it...Have a good
  summer to all............Stan

Steve, Sven:

I don't know of any mail software that prevents replies to messages
currently being viewed or replied-to, however, it is possible to quickly
notify others that a message has been replied-to or deleted by using a
mailbox format that permits concurrent updates of message status flags.
If you combine such a mailbox format with an IMAP daemon, you can make
changes in message status visible to all the concurrent users, on
potentially different platforms.  There is still a potential race
condition where two people can begin replying to the same message nearly
simultaneously, but it is still much better than having no idea what the
other people are doing.

Concurrent access to a mailbox by multiple users is one of the strenghths
of IMAP, but you have to use a mailbox format that is amenable to this
functionality.  In addition, you could consider modifying an IMAP client
to use IMAP message flags in a way that would simulate advisory locking
for purposes of a Reply function.

Either the Cyrus IMAP server from CMU or the UW IMAP server using TENEX
format mailboxes will fill the bill (although the TENEX format prohibits
expunging unless there is only one user, but flag --message status--
updates, e.g. Deleted or Answered, may be made by multiple users
concurrently, and IMAPd will notify every user agent of any changes.)

Putting the locking burden on imapd allows you to use any IMAP clients on
any platforms.  Alternatively, you can have everyone run Pine on a single
machine and again use TENEX as the mailbox format.

    Are you trying to post to a newsgroup via email?  To post directly, 
put the cursor anywhere in the header and press Ctrl-R, for "rich 
headers."  That should display a field for newsgroups.  Of course, the 
computer system you are on must be configured properly to make use of 
that feature.  (That's a system administration function I admit I am not 
an expert on.)  If you are replying to a newsgroup post in a newsgroup 
folder, Pine should ask you if you want to reply to the newsgroup.  If 
you say that you do, it will fill in the newsgroups field for you.  If 
you are replying to an email, rather than a newsgroup posting, maybe I'm 
not sure just what the problem is.  Newsgroups and mailing lists are not 
actually the same thing.

Are you talking about having mail delivered to the home directory?  Pine
does not deliver mail.

If you are talking about recognizing a file on the home directory as
INBOX, modify the routine env_init() in c-client/env_unix.c

Let me try again.

Internally, Pine has a series of tests in which it classifies files by
what format they are.  Once the file has been classified by type,
operations performed on the file are handled by specific code (called
"drivers") for each type.

For example, there is a "get message header by message number" function,
which is different for each type.  One of the functions is "append
additional message to this file".

That error message is generated when you call the "append" function for a
file of type "arbitrary text".

You can do certain other things with a file of type "arbitrary text".  You
can open it in Pine, in which case it will appear as a single message with
a pseudo-header containing the file author and create date for its "From"
and "Date" headers.  But you can not append to such files.

Please do.  I will be happy to analyze it.  But please be sure that you
are actually reading it as a mail box file, and not as an arbitrary file.

Greetins,
	My name is Brad J B Bristow-Stagg and I am a sys admin at the
Central Queensland University for CQ-PAN.  We are thinking of using PINE as
our new mail reader.  Currently all users have a menu a/c (none but admin
have bash a/c's).  I was wondering if someone could either point me in the
direction of where in the source code that I have to change so that users
can't read in any other file other than the .sig specified in the .pinerc,
and also if there are any other things I have to take into consideration. 
My thanks for your time.  I would ask that all replies are send via e-mail
as I don't get much time to check news.  Once again my thanks..

Brad J B Bristow-Stagg
CQ-PAN Systems Administrator.

I have to agree here. I do want some sort of integration, but it _has_
to ask me my pass phrase to sign/decrypt/etc. messages. Like Robert
said, if it does it all automatically, why bother using it?

The key point here is integration, I don't want to have to rely on
using alternative-editors to use PGP. I want it to be a keystroke
(much like the ME versions of elm), but I do not want it taking any
actions automatically.

Just my thoughts on this...

Subject: 0.0 Preliminaries

Q: How can I have my incoming mailing-list messages automatically put
   into appropriate folders?

This is one of the most frequently asked questions about email.  This
FAQ provides basic instructions for Unix users to set up either
procmail, mailagent, or elm's filter to filter incoming mailing-list
messages.  If you have a choice, I recommend procmail which is
powerful, robust, and is actively developed and supported.

All these mail processors can also be set up to filter other types of
incoming messages, send automated replies, etc.  For instructions see
the relevant references listed below.

From: FAQ Editor <faq-editor@ii.com>
Subject: 1.0 Mail Folder Strategies

It is a good idea to come up with a system for naming and reading
your mail folders.  With a good system, you will have an easier time
managing the hundreds (or thousands!) of messages you will receive.

------------------------------

Date: 18 Apr 1995 00:01:10 GMT
From: FAQ Editor <faq-editor@ii.com>
Subject:     1.1 Naming Incoming Mail Folders

For my incoming mail folders I use names that start with `IN'.  For
example, I put mail sent to the procmail mailing list into a folder
named IN.procmail.  This way when all my folders are listed
alphabetically the incoming folders are together and near the top.
They are near the top because Unix is case sensitive and upper case
letters come before lower case letters in an ascii sort.

Of course, you can use any names you like for your mail folders!

------------------------------

Date: 18 Apr 1995 00:01:20 GMT
From: FAQ Editor <faq-editor@ii.com>
Subject:     1.2 Reading Incoming Mail Folders

Here are some instructions for opening a mail folder that's in the
default folder directory for some mailers and newsreaders.

         Default Folder  
 Reader   Directory      Command line command  From within reader
 ======  ==============  ====================  ==================
 elm     ~/Mail          elm -f =folder        c =folder
 pine    ~/mail          pine -if folder       G folder
 mail    ~/mail          mail -f /path/folder
 nn      ~/News          nn +folder            G +folder
 
(Please send me information for other mailers and newsreaders.)

Pine has an incoming-folder variable which you can use to list your
incoming folders in a separate section of your folder list (to view
your folder list in Pine, type `L').  Setting this variable also
allows you to use the Tab key to step through all new messages in all
your incoming folders.  For more information see the question "How
can I filter messages into different incoming folders?" in the Pine
FAQ:

  http://www.washington.edu/pine/faq/usage.html#filter


IMPORTANT NOTE 
============== 
If you are going to be editing your incoming mail folder, e.g.,
deleting messages, then your filtering program and your folder reader
should use locking schemes that work together.  Otherwise, if mail is
delivered at the same time that you are deleting a message your
folder may be corrupted.  To learn more about locking see the
question "What is folder locking and how does it work?" in the Pine
FAQ.  This is useful to read even if you don't use Pine as your
mailer.

  http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine/faq/errors.html#locking

Most mailers, such as pine and elm, use lock a file named
`folder.lock' to lock the folder named `folder'.  Note that nn does
not lock folders so you probably don't want to use nn to delete
messages in a folder that is receiving incoming messages.  (Please
send me info about locking in other mailers and newsreaders.)

For more information about specific mailers and newsreaders, see the
relevant documentation, such as man pages and Web pages.  Some
pointers to documentation are listed in section 5.0.

Date: 18 Apr 1995 00:02:00 GMT
From: FAQ Editor <faq-editor@ii.com>
Subject: 2.0 Procmail

Procmail is a powerful mail processor that can be used to process your
mail messages either as they arrive or after they are in a mail folder.  
To find out how to process an existing mail folder see the NOTES section
of the procmail(1) man page.

------------------------------

Date: 18 Apr 1995 00:02:10 GMT
From: FAQ Editor <faq-editor@ii.com>
Subject:     2.1 Setting Up Procmail

To set up and test procmail, follow the ten steps given in sections
2.1.1 through 2.1.4 below.

------------------------------

Date: 18 Apr 1995 00:02:11 GMT
From: FAQ Editor <faq-editor@ii.com>
Subject:         2.1.1 Is Procmail on Your System?

1]  To find out if procmail is on your system and what the full path to 
    it is, type one of the following commands:

      Shell      Command
      =====      =======
      csh        which procmail
      sh or ksh  type procmail
      various    whereis procmail
      various    where procmail

    Make a note of the full path to procmail because this is needed in
    step 5b below.  You can find out the version by typing:

      procmail -v

   The latest released version, as of 15 April 1995, is 3.10.
   Version 3.11 should be out soon.  If your system doesn't have
   procmail or doesn't have the latest version, you may want to ask
   your system administrator to install it.  The procmail package of
   tools is at:

 ftp://ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/pub/packages/procmail/procmail.tar.gz

   If your sys admin isn't able to do this, use a different mail
   processor like mailagent (described in section 3 of this FAQ) or
   filter (described in section 4).

Subject:         2.1.2 Setting Up Procmail for Testing

2a] Create ~/.procmailrc.  

     cd
     pico .procmailrc

    NOTE: Throughout this article I use pico for editing files.
          Replace `pico' with your editor.

2b] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.procmailrc.
    Note that lines that begin with # are comments and are ignored by
    procmail.

     #Set on when debugging
     VERBOSE=off
 
     #Replace `mail' with your mail directory (Pine uses mail, Elm uses Mail)
     MAILDIR=$HOME/mail
     
     #Directory for storing procmail log and rc files
     PMDIR=$HOME/.procmail
     
     LOGFILE=$PMDIR/log
     INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/rc.testing
     INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/rc.maillists

3] Create the directory where you will store your procmail log and rc files 
   (this is $PMDIR that you set above).

     cd
     mkdir .procmail


4a] Create an rc (run commands) file for testing:

     cd .procmail
     pico rc.testing


4b] Enter the following in ~/.procmail/rc.testing:

      :0:
      * ^Subject:.*test
      IN.testing

    Note that the first line contains a zero (0), not the letter "oh".
    For now, don't worry about the meaning of this recipe.  It is
    explained in 2.3 "Explanation of Test Recipe."


5a] Create a ~/.forward file by typing the following. (Pico's -w flag tells 
    pico not to auto wrap lines.)

     cd
     pico -w .forward



5b] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.forward:


     "|IFS=' ' && exec /usr/local/bin/procmail -f- || exit 75 #nancym"


    == IMPORTANT NOTES ==
    * Make sure you include all the quotes, both double (") and single (').
    * The vertical bar (|) is a pipe.
    * Replace /usr/local/bin with the correct path for procmail (see step 1).
    * Replace `nancym' with your userid.  You need to put your userid in 
      your .forward so that it will be different than any other .forward file 
      on your system.
   
    * Do NOT use ~ or environment variables, like $HOME, in your .forward
      file.  If procmail resides below your home directory write out the 
      *full* path.


5c] On many systems you need to make your .forward world 
    readable and your home directory world searchable in order for the
    mail transport agent to "see" it.  To do this type:
   
      cd
      chmod 644 .forward
      chmod a+x .

Subject:         2.1.3 Testing

6] Send yourself two test messages: one with `test' in the subject
   and one without `test' in the subject.


7] Start your mailer (pine, elm, etc.) and check that the messages
   were delivered correctly.  The one with `test' in the subject
   should be in the folder $MAILDIR/IN.testing and the one without 
   `test' in the subject should be in your inbox.  

   If these were not delivered correctly, see section 2.2 on
   "Troubleshooting Procmail" section below.

From: FAQ Editor <faq-editor@ii.com>
Subject:         2.1.4 Setting Up Procmail to Filter Mailing List Messages

8a] Once you have successfully tested procmail in steps 6 and 7, create 
     rc.maillists for filtering incoming mailing-list messages into mail 
     folders.
  
      cd
      cd .procmail
      pico rc.maillists


8b] In rc.maillists, create a recipe, like the two example recipes
    below, for each of your mailing lists.

     :0:
     * ^TOwww-talk
     IN.www-talk

     :0:
     * ^TOprocmail
     IN.procmail
     
     The first recipe filters the www-talk mailing list and the second 
     recipe filters the procmail mailing lists.  The meaning of the first 
     recipe is as follows:

     Notation      Meaning
     ========      =======
     :0            Begin a recipe
       :           Use a lock file
     *             Begin a condition 
       ^TO         Match ``To:'' ``Cc:'' or other synonyms for To at the
                   beginning of a line, followed by any or no characters,
                   followed by....
          www-talk  ``www-talk''
     IN.www-talk   If successful match, put in folder $MAILDIR/IN.www-talk

  
     IMPORTANT NOTES
     ===============
     * ^TO is not a normal regular expression; it is a special
       procmail expression that is designed to catch any destination
       specification.  For details, see the MISCELLANEOUS section of
       the procmailrc(5) man pages.

     * Do not put a space between the caret (^) and the word `TO' in
       `^TO'.

     * Do not put a space between the `^TO' and the text that you are
       matching on; it must be `^TOtext'.

     * Both letters in `TO' must be capitalized.
       

9]  Repeat steps 6 and 7 to make sure that things are still working.


10]  Comment out the rc.testing line in you .procmailrc file so that it looks 
     like this:
          
       VERBOSE=off
       MAILDIR=$HOME/mail
       PMDIR=$HOME/.procmail
       LOGFILE=$PMDIR/log
       # INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/rc.testing
       INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/rc.maillists

     NOTE: Leaving the rc.testing line in your .procmailrc file is
           useful for future testing.

If messages are not delivered correctly, here are steps you can use to
try to solve the problem.

From: FAQ Editor <faq-editor@ii.com>
Subject:         2.2.1 General Strategies

1]    Look at your $LOGFILE (~/.procmail/log) to see if you can
      determine what the problem is.

2]    Check these three files for typos:
        ~/.forward
        ~/.procmailrc
        ~/.procmail/rc.testing

3]    Check the file and directory permissions of your .forward (set in 
      5c in "Setting up Procmail for Testing" above).

      Type...          In order to...
      -------          --------------
      cd               Go to your home directory.
      
      ls -l .forward   Check the permission: it should say -rw-r--r--
      
      ls -ld .         Check permission of home dir: it should say drwx?-x?-x
                       The ?'s may be r's or hyphens or one of each (i.e.,
                       drwx--x--x, drwxr-xr-x, drwxr-x--x, drwx--xr-x are
                       each acceptable.)
      

4]    If the above three steps do not locate the problem edit your 
      ~/.procmailrc so that it contains:

        VERBOSE=on

      Test procmail by following steps 6 and 7 again.  Look at your
      $LOGFILE (which will contain verbose messages) to see if you
      can now determine what the problem is.

      If you are still having problems see the next section on
      "Alternate .forward Files."  After you get procmail to work, 
      you probably will want to set VERBOSE back to off.

Subject:         2.2.2 Alternate .forward files

If the .forward template in 5b above doesn't work the following alternatives 
might be helpful:

In a perfect world:
	"|exec /usr/local/bin/procmail #nancym"
In an almost perfect world:
	"|exec /usr/local/bin/procmail USER=nancym"
In another world:
	"|IFS=' ';exec /usr/local/bin/procmail #nancym"
In a different world:
	"|IFS=' ';exec /usr/local/bin/procmail USER=nancym"
In a smrsh world:
	"|/usr/local/bin/procmail #nancym"

These formats can be tried in different combinations, the leading "| can
be tried as |" instead, or vice versa.

NOTE
====
If your system uses procmail as its local delivery agent, you do not
need a .forward file; simply having a .procmailrc files suffices.  To
find out if procmail is the local delivery agent, ask your system
administrator.

Subject:     2.4 Tracking Your Incoming Mail

You can use mailstat, a useful script that is part of the procmail
package, to check your procmail log file. Check to see if it is 
on your system by typing either `which mailstat' or `type mailstat'.  
If it's on your system type:

  mailstat $HOME/.procmail/log

This displays a concise version of your log file and moves your log 
file to log.old.  You may want to put the above line in your .login so that 
each time you log in you will see a listing of how many messages you've
received since the last time you ran mailstat, and what folders these
messages were delivered to.

You can get a mailstat listing of log.old by using the -o flag:

  mailstat -o $HOME/.procmail/log


If mailstat is not on your system ask your system administrator to
install it.  The script is located with all the other procmail tools
(see 2.1.1 above for the ftp location).

From: Raphael Manfredi <ram@hptnos02.grenoble.hp.com>
Subject: 3.0 Mailagent

Mailagent is a powerful mail processing package that can be used to
process your mail messages, either at arrival time via a .forward hook
or later on while they are already saved in a mail folder.

Mailagent is written in Perl and hence has all the advantages of being
interpreted, i.e. it is easy to enhance dynamically and to customize.

This version of the FAQ describes the basics of setting up mailagent to
process incoming mail messages from within a .forward. To find out about
the more advanced features of mailagent, please refer to the mailagent(1)
manual page.

------------------------------

Date: 18 Apr 1995 00:03:10 GMT
From: Raphael Manfredi <ram@hptnos02.grenoble.hp.com>
Subject:     3.1 Setting Up Mailagent

1] First, make sure mailagent is available on your system. The easiest
   way to do this is to run:

    mailagent -V

   which will print the mailagent version if it is available, or the shell
   will issue an error message "mailagent: not found" or something like it.

2a] Now you need to understand the MTA (Mail Transport Agent, the program
    that delivers the mail; usually, sendmail) will NOT deliver to mailagent
    directly, rather to an intermediate (small) filter program. Two versions
    are available: shell or C -- refer to the mailagent(1) manpage to choose,
    but I recommend you use the C version first, and move to the shell
    version if you can't run a binary from your .forward file.

2b] Locate the filter program (it will be filter or filter.sh depending on
    whether you choose the C or the shell version respectively) under some
    directory like /usr/local/lib/mailagent. From now on, we'll assume we
    use the C filter and that it is located under /usr/local/lib/mailagent.

3] Copy the file /usr/local/lib/mailagent/mailagent.cf as ~/.mailagent and
   edit it to configure your system correctly. You will see two distinct
   sections in that file and you need to set-up properly the first one, the
   "Configuration section".

   If you have a version of mailagent that is recent enough (at least 3.0 PL32)
   then you can create an initial configuration very easily and quickly by
   running the following command:

    mailagent -I

   which will set-up an almost ready-to-use ~/.mailagent file. All you
   need to do at this point is go through its configuration section
   to make sure mailagent made the right choices...

   The minimal set of variables that MUST be correctly set (i.e. for which
   you cannot rely on the default set in the file) are (# introduces comment
   in a shell-like manner, which run up to the end of the line):

    home:  # Your HOME directory, as reported by "echo $HOME", usually.
    path:  # Path to be used to locate mailagent and perl, at least.
    p_xxx: # Path to be appended to "path" above when running on machine "xxx".
    user:  # Your login name.
    name:  # Your name.
    level: # Logging level. I recommend you raise it to 20 for testing.

   The mail folder directory is ~/Mail by default, but it can be changed
   only from within your rule file by putting

    maildir = ~/mail;

   at its top, for instance, to make it ~/mail. The rule file is defined as
   the "rules" parameter, and is set to ~/.rules by default.

4] Ensure the directories configured in your ~/.mailagent under "logdir" and
   "spool" and "queue" do exist. If you use the standard setting, this
   requires the following commands:

    cd
    mkdir var
    cd var
    mkdir log mailagent
    cd mailagent
    mkdir queue

5a] Create a rule file (named ~/.rules by default) for testing:

    cd
    vi .rules

5b] Enter the following in ~/.rules

    Subject: /test/     { SAVE testing };

    The meaning of that rule should be pretty obvious: If we receive a mail
    whose subject line contains the word "test", then we save that mail in
    a folder named "testing", under the default folder directory (~/Mail).

5c] Create a ~/.forward file as follows:

    "|exec /usr/local/lib/mailagent/filter >> /export/home/ram/.bak 2>&1"

    The meaning of that line is the following: every mail should be piped
    (hence the leading "|" character) onto the filter program, and any
    output from that program (i.e. errors) are appended to some file in
    your home directory, with stderr following stdout (2>&1) in traditional
    sh syntax.

    == IMPORTANT NOTES ==
    * Your .forward is always processed by sh, regardless of your login shell.
    * Replace /export/home/ram with your proper login directory full path.
      That's a part that makes your .forward unique (for zealous optimizing
      sendmail that are dead wrong about optimizing!) and that can save
      you a lot of trouble if anything goes wrong! Just look at your ~/.bak!
    * Replace /usr/local/lib/mailagent/filter with the proper filter path
      on your machine.

5d] Note that on many systems, you need to ensure your .forward will be
    readable by everybody, and that your home directory has the "x" bit set
    for everybody (i.e. can be part of a lookup path) so that sendmail can see
    and parse your .forward file. To ensure this, type:

        cd
        chmod a+r .forward
        chmod a+x .

6] Send yourself two test messages: one with "test" in the subject, and one
   without "test" in the subject.

7a] Checkout your ~/.bak file: it should be empty!

7b] Checkout your ~/var/log/agentlog file to see what really happened to your
    messages. Watch out for any ERROR or WARNING logs. This assumes you have
    left at least the default logging level (9) in the ~/.mailagent file (the
    "level" variable). But for testing, that level should be raised to 20 to
    help you diagnose what's going on.

7c] Look out in ~/Mail/testing. You should find there the message whose Subject
    line contained the word "test". Then make sure the other message has been
    delivered to your regular mailbox. (Since no match occurred in your rule
    file, the mail is left in your mailbox by default).

7d] TROUBLESHOOTING
    * If your mail was not properly delivered, please make sure your rule file
      and configuration file are correct by issuing the following command:

        mailagent -d

    * If the previous command does not output the single rule you should have
      put in ~/.rules, then please make sure step 3 and 4 above were correctly
      performed (those being the crucial steps ensuring a proper configuration).
    
    * Check the ~/.bak file for error messages.

    * Check for typos in any of these files:
        ~/.forward
        ~/.mailagent
        ~/.rules
    
    * Check the file and directory permissions of your .forward (set in step
      5c above).

      Type...          In order to...
      -------          --------------
      cd               Go to your home directory.
      
      ls -l .forward   Check the permission: it should say -rw-r--r--
      
      ls -ld .         Check permission of home dir: it should say drwx?-x?-x
                       The ?'s may be r's or hyphens or one of each (i.e.,
                       drwx--x--x, drwxr-xr-x, drwxr-x--x, drwx--xr-x).
      
    * If none of the previous hints helped you identify problem, and you can't
      figure it out from the output in ~/.bak or in the ~/var/log/agentlog file
      (or whatever file you have configured for logging within your ~/.mailagent
      file, variables "log" and "logdir"), then make sure your mail is not
      waiting in the MTA's queue: this might be the case if the agentlog file
      is empty. If you are using sendmail as MTA, you can run:

        /usr/lib/sendmail -bp
    
      to print out the queue.
    
    * As a last resort, please look at the mailagent(1) manual page under
      the section "Testing Your Installation" for more tips and things
      to look at.

8] Once you have successfully tested mailagent in steps 6 and 7 above,
   you're on! Mailagent is ready to process your mail. All you have to
   do is extend the ~/.rules file to add more rules.

   For instance:

   To Cc: www-talk      { SAVE www-talk };
   To Cc: agent-users   { SAVE agent-users };

   Those two rules filter the two mailing lists www-talk and agent-users into
   their respective folders, whether the mailing list address appear in the To
   OR Cc header.

   Since rules are not qualified as a pattern match (contrary to our test
   above), they match on logins in the address, i.e. they will match things
   like www-talk@chip.com or chip!www-talk, or a plain simple www-talk if
   this is a local alias. (This implicit matching on logins works only for
   some selectors like To, Cc or From which are know to contain addresses).

   If you wish to sort on patterns appearing in the Subject of messages for
   instance, then you must use a pattern matching syntax, as in:

   Subject: /star trek/ { SAVE star-trek; };

   to save in a folder "star-trek" all the messages whose subject contains
   the words "star trek". Case matters, but keep on reading...

9] As an advanced topic, since mailagent is written in Perl, you have all the
   power of Perl's regular expressions at your disposal. Which means you can
   write things like this:

   To Cc: agent-users                    { REJECT AGENT };
   <AGENT> Subject: /^\w*subscribe/i     { DELETE };
   <AGENT> *                             { UNIQUE -a; SAVE agent };

   The second lines makes use of that perl extended regular expression syntax:
   \w matches an alphanumeric character plus "_", while the trailing "i" option
   requests a case-insensitive match.

   You also note you have a real automaton at your disposal. You can enter
   a special state (AGENT in our example) and continue parsing by only
   scanning for rules tagged by this mode. The first match stops the automaton,
   unless you REJECT to continue processing. When not restricted by a mode list,
   a rule is always taken into account. For example, assuming the automaton
   is in the state "NEWS", it will not consider rules tagged <AGENT>, as in
   the above example. The automaton begins in mode "INITIAL".

   The "UNIQUE -a" action followed by a SAVE ensures only one copy per
   Message-ID will ever end-up in your agent folder -- no duplicates!
   Also note you can have more than one action per rule, and that the last
   one uses '*' to match anything, i.e. its action part between {} will
   always be executed in AGENT mode, when reached by the automaton.

   Also, since in Perl regular expression syntax, \b matches a word-boundary
   and \s any space or tab character, we can write our Star Trek message
   sorting into a much more robust form:

   Subject: /\bstar\s+trek\b/i  { SAVE star-trek; };

   (\s+ matches one or more white spaces, while \s* would match zero or more,
   see the Perl manual page for a complete description of regular expressions.)

   which will match on various subject strings like "Last Star Trek season"
   or "I am addicted to Star trek", but not on "Tristar treks" -- whatever
   that means :-)

   All in all, the filtering automaton syntax is pretty much intuitive and
   easy to read. You have to learn which actions are possible and what they
   mean, naturally.

Subject:     3.2 Tracking Your Incoming Mail

If you are curious about what mailagent does to your mail, you have two
options:

    * Look at your "agentlog" file, with a log level set to 9.
    * Get a summary of all the actions performed by running:

        mailagent -summary

      This last option is only possible if you have initialized the statistics
      gathering process by creating a ~/var/mailagent/mailagent.st file (under
      the default setting from ~/.mailagent).

      You will get a clear picture of your processing, by seeing which rule
      match, how often, in which state, etc... You will also know how many
      times you SAVE or DELETE messages for instance.

      Actually, mailagent statistics are triggered by a simple

        mailagent -s
    
      command, the letters given after in the {u,m,a,r,y} set being options
      that alter the output given by the command.

    * Look at the ~/.bak occasionally to make sure no error is pending...

From: Raphael Manfredi <ram@hptnos02.grenoble.hp.com>
Subject:     3.3 How Safe Mailagent Processing Is?

As soon as the filter program has taken a hold on your message, you can rest
assured the mail will get filtered one way or the other. If filter can't
queue your mail, it will exit with an exit status of 75, that status
being recognized by "sendmail" as a "deliver later on" hint, in which case
the mail message will safely wait in sendmail's queue.

So if filter gets your message, it immediately forks and exits with a 0
status for sendmail, letting it know its work is finished and releasing it
to save resources. It then calls mailagent on the queued message (in mailagent's
private queue) to actually process the message.

Only after successful processing will mailagent delete the queued message.
Hence, under an heavily loaded system, the worst that could happen would be
a duplicate processing of a message, or a bounce back when sendmail cannot
fork and exec the filter program from your .forward.

Under catastrophic conditions, filter or mailagent will simply dump the message
on stdout, for ~/.bak to catch, preceded by the reason why processing was
aborted.

Subject:     3.4 Locking Under Mailagent

By default, mailagent proceeds with a fixed locking scheme (.lock extension)
plus flock() if asked to do so at Configure time. However, mailagent provides
support for NFS-secure locks and also can use non-standard locking procedures,
configurable from within ~/.mailagent (variables "nfslock" and "mboxlock").

However, it cannot support locking on a rule basis (yet!). The author is
willing to raise the priority of that item if one comes up with a legitimate
need for that feature that could not be worked-around by a PERL escape. ;-)

Subject:     3.5 Folder Types Supported

Mailagent can deliver mail to plain UNIX folders (also known as "mbox format"),
to MMDF folders, to MH folders (with unseen sequence update built-in and using
locks, not like rcvstore which does not!) or to directories (ala MH, but
without unseen sequence support and with alternate naming possible).

It also supports delivery to folders with the "x" bit set, in which case
mailagent interprets those as being hooks. It either pipes the message
to the "program" or further interprets the hook to do more processing.
See the manual page mailagent(1) under the section "MAIL HOOKS" for more
details.

Filter is part of the Elm package of tools.  Note that you can use filter
to filter your incoming mail even if you are not using Elm to read your mail.

IMPORTANT NOTE
==============
If your system has both procmail and filter installed then you should use 
procmail which is *much* more robust and powerful than filter.  This 
recommendation is almost universal; even the developers of Elm and Filter
recommend procmail over filter.  IT IS POSSIBLE TO LOSE MAIL MESSAGES
WHEN USING FILTER; this is rare but it has happened.

Subject:     4.1 Setting up Filter
Followup-To: comp.mail.elm

1] Find out if filter is on your system and what the full path to it is.  
   If you are using the C shell (csh) type:

     which filter

   Or, if you are using the Korn shell (ksh) or the Bourne shell (sh) type:

     type filter

   If neither ``which'' nor ``type'' are on your system try ``where'' and
   ``whereis''.  If your system doesn't have filter ask your system 
   administrator to install it; or even better ask her to install procmail.


2] Note the full path of your home directory by typing:

     cd
     pwd


3a] Create ~/.elm/filter-rules.  (Note that throughout this article I use
    pico for editing files.  Replace ``pico'' with your editor.)

     cd
     mkdir .elm
     cd .elm
     pico filter-rules

  
3b] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.elm/filter-rules

     if (subject contains "test") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.testing"
   
   Replace /j/nancym with your home directory path (see step 2).
   Replace /Mail with the name of the directory where your mail folders are
   stored.  Pine and Berkeley Mail use /mail (lower case m) and Elm uses 
   /Mail (upper case M).
   

4] To see what the filter rule will do type the following at your Unix 
   prompt:  

     filter -r


5a] Create a ~/.forward file by typing the following. (Pico's -w flag tells 
    pico not to auto wrap lines.)

      cd
      pico -w .forward


5b] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.forward:


     "|/usr/local/bin/filter -o /j/nancym/.elm/filter-errors"


    == IMPORTANT NOTES ==
    * Make sure you include the quotes (").
    * The vertical bar (|) is a pipe.
    * Replace /usr/local/bin with the correct path for filter (see step 1).
    * Replace /j/nancym with your home directory (see step 2).
   
    * Do NOT expect environment variables, like $HOME, to work in your 
      .forward file.
    * Do NOT expect ~ to mean your home directory in the .forward file.


5c] Note that on many systems you need to make your .forward is world 
    readable and your home directory world searchable in order for the
    mail transport agent to "see" it.  To do this type:
   
      cd
      chmod 644 .forward
      chmod a+x .


6] Send yourself two test messages: one with ``test'' in the subject
   and one without ``test'' in the subject.


7a] Start your mailer (pine, elm, etc.) and check that the messages
    were delivered correctly.  The one with ``test'' in the subject
    should be in the folder IN.testing and the one without ``test'' 
    in the subject should be in your inbox.  If these were delivered 
    correctly go on to step 8.


7b] TROUBLESHOOTING
    * If the two messages were not delivered correctly look at your
      ~/.elm/filter-errors to see if you can determine what the problem 
      is.  

    * Check these two files for typos:
        ~/.forward
        ~/.elm/filter-rules

    * Check the file and directory permissions of your .forward (set in 
      5c above).

      Type...          In order to...
      -------          --------------
      cd               Go to your home directory.
      
      ls -l .forward   Check the permission: it should say -rw-r--r--
      
      ls -ld .         Check permission of home dir: it should say drwx?-x?-x
                       The ?'s may be r's or hyphens or one of each (i.e.,
                       drwx--x--x, drwxr-xr-x, drwxr-x--x, drwx--xr-x).
      

    * If none of these turn up the problem edit your ~/.forward so
      that filter will be verbose with it's output (use the -vo flag).

        "|/usr/local/bin/filter -vo /j/nancym/.elm/filter-errors"

      And repeat steps 6 and 7.  After you get filter to work you 
      will probably want to change the ``-vo'' flag back to ``-o''.

   
8]  After you have successfully tested filter in steps 6 and 7, edit
    ~/.elm/filter-rules so that it contains a modified version of the
    following:

     # if (subject contains "test") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.testing"
     if (to contains "www-talk") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.www-talk"
     if (to contains "hopos-l") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.hopos"

     Replace /j/nancym with your home directory path and
     /Mail with the name of your mail directory.  Replace the mailing 
     list string (e.g., "www-talk") and the name of the mail folder
     (e.g., IN.www-talk) with text for your mailing lists.

     Note that ``to contains...'' means either the To or Cc header contains...

     Rather than deleting the test line, it's useful to just turn it
     into a comment (by preceding it with #) so that you can easily
     use it for future testing.

Subject:     4.2 Tracking Your Incoming Mail
Followup-To: comp.mail.elm

You can get a short summary of filter's activity by typing:

    filter -s

For a longer summary type:

    filter -S

Or you can look at the log file itself, ~/.elm/filterlog.

You should regularly look at ~/.elm/filter-errors to make sure things 
are working.  You can automatically check filter-errors each time you
log in by putting the following in your .login:

    tail ~/.elm/filter-errors

Also you probably want to regularly delete filterlog and filter-errors so 
they don't fill up your disk space.  To get a summary of the filter log and 
clear it type:

    filter -cs

Darn.  That was supposed to be, "... pine accepts the majority of folders
i create using *vm*."  The point is that there is some small discrepancy in 
some otherwise mbox-conforming folders which other mail browsers accept, 
both for foldering and browsing, but which pine rejects.

I have been trying to say that i don't mean to suggest accepting arbitrary
text files!  Rather, there is some minor discrepancy in some folders which
causes pine to reject it.

As it happens, David Miller <dlm@cac.washington.edu> also responded,
asking for the sample, and in tracking down a valid, minimalist sample i
identified the problem.  Pine requires the date number on the first line
of the file to occupy two spaces, even when it's a single digit date. 
(Most mail folder-ers pad the date with a space, but one that i used, at
least in 1992, which is the date of an offending message i found, did not,
causing my problem.)

The attachment contains an example of this, as a single-entry mbox file.
SunOS 4 bin/mail and ucb/mail, and SunOS 5 mailx (and vm), all accept it
as an mbox-format file (displaying the sender and subject in the header 
summary, etc) without hesitation.  Add a space before the date number, 
and pine then accepts it as an mbox, also.

I think it would be sufficient and proper to impose a weaker criterion for
distinguishing mbox-format files, though i guess you have to consider the
other contingencies for the file-type "driver".

Ideally, however, i think having "From "  as the first characters in the
file would be sufficient.  You're probably just as likely to encounter a
false positive from a file that has an excerpt of the first line from a
valid mbox file as you are to encounter a non-mbox file that happens to
start with "From ".  You could always add the constraint that the last
non-blank character of the first line be a digit, and eliminate almost all
of the latter type of false positives, and still not exclude mbox files
produced by slightly aberrant mail folder-ers...

Hi there,

I am sorry, but I'm probably the 1 millionth guy to ask this:
(I'm sorry but I couldn't find any FAQ)

Is there a possibilty, just as with the X.400 message handling, to be 
acknowledged that the person you have sent an email to, has received or 
has read it.


Cheers,

Mark

    Although I do not have the source code at hand, it seems to me that

This is a very useful function.  Why are you advocating disallowing it?

In the pine FAQ, I see the following:

Pine has been compiled on other UNIX platforms (4.3 Berkeley UNIX, 
DEC OSF/1 V1.2A, Dynix/PTX V1.4.0, VAX Ultrix 4.1, A/UX 3.0, BSD/386 
Gamma 4.1, Convex, Dynix 3.0 and 3.1 on Sequent Symmetry, 
Interactive Systems Corporation UNIX, Silicon Graphics IRIS with 
IRIX 4.0.1, SCO Unix, System V release 4) as well.

Anything new with Silicon Graphics on IRIX 5.3?  Send me an email if
you have a good pointer.  Thanks.

As a system administrator I find myself logging into various accounts 
(news, feedback, webmaster, etc..) using 'su', or launching a new telnet 
window. Is there anyway to load ONE copy of Pine and switch between the 
different mailbox's from within it?

Hi,


Can anyone tell me how to place my curser at the end of a document easily.

I have a rather large document that I have to add on to the end of each 
week. It takes forever to get there by using Control V.  

Thanks.

Pine is trying to open an IMAP connection to your server, 192.106.152.1,
aka galactica.galactica.it, and it is apparently not running IMAP.

I'm not sure if the Amiga port includes the experimental POP driver.  If
it does, try "{192.106.152.1/pop3}inbox".

                           ^^^^^
This is incorrect.  The user-domain should be set to _only_ the part after
the '@', e.g. "galactica.it".

How about you press a key and it asks for passphrase and THEN signs
the letter.

How about you read the message, notice it is encrypted and you ask it
to decrypt the message and it asks for passphrase and THEN decrypts
the letter. 

BUT, all of these should be options INSIDE the mailer.

The ^W command (WhereIs) lets you search for given text.  It also can be
followed by ^Y (to take you to the last line) or ^Y (to take you to the
first line). 

Summary:	Last line:	^W ^V

To whom it may concern:

I am testing PICO 2.5. I agree completely that it is an easy to use editor
for UNIX (as is PINE for news and mail). But I have the following problems:

1) The keybord blocks when I try to enter German umlauts into text. But if
   I load a text which contains already umlauts I can search and find them
   with ^w and delete them with ^d (so the keyboard does not block the
   input field for ^w when entering a German umlaut). What can be done for
   entering German umlauts into the text ? For recommendation of the product
   to our users this is a decisive point.

2) I hav no success with operations of selected text, that is to mark
   selected text at all. Is it Ctrl-caret or double caret ? 

Thank you for answering these questions,

Wolf Kammer

The problem is that Sun has chosen a slightly non-standard format for
their mailboxes.  Instead of just marking the beginning of a new
message with a line beginning with "From ", they use the "From " line
together with the character-count contained in the Content-Length:
line.

Because Sun uses this format, they allow mail messages that contain
"From " as the first 5 characters on a line.  Sun-supplied mail readers
(like Mailtool) know that these lines are part of the message, but
other programs (like Pine) do not.

Fortunately, the solution is simple.  If, as I suspect, you're on a
Solaris system, just edit the /etc/mail/sendmail.cf file and change the
line

Or you can recompile... there's an option for default debug levels
somewhere... in the /pine source directory in on of the two files
	Makefile.xxx
OR
	os-xxx.c

where xxx represents your build architecture.  Have fun.

Message-Id: <40sr0c$nc5@dingo.cc.uq.oz.au>

I've been trying for some time to get Pine built on my NetBSD
system.  My first problem was that I was trying to "build bsd"
because it seemed the closest thing to my system.  Now I now
that there's a NetBSD port, accessable by "build neb", but it's
undocumented :(  It takes about an hour to build everything on
my system, and boy was I kicking myself after I'd tried the
bsd makefiles about 5 times.

Anyway, "build neb" seems to work.  However, when I run Pine,
it starts up normally, and all is well... until it tries to get
configuration settings from either pine.conf or .pinerc.  It
simply cannot read data.  I've traced the whole procedure with
ktrace/kdump, and it seems that Pine is finding the files, setting
a lock on them, opening them and reading 0 bytes :(  WHY???

Can anyone suggest anything?  TIA.

Personally, I'd prefer to only have to enter my passphrase once during a
session. If I quit and restart Pine, then I'd enter it again.

On multiuser systems at my site, we have a daemon that automatically logs
you out if you've been inactive for more than 15 minutes. For folks with
workstations or PCs, we strongly recommend users run a password-protected
screen saver so that if someone tries to break into their machine,
hopefully they'll have to reboot to defeat the screen saver and then any
in-memory passphrase would be lost.

Maybe there could be an option for Pine to not save the passphrase for
those who are not comfortable with that sort of operation.

Message-Id: <40t1u0$kr@ivory.dsu.edu>

Has anyone found a solution for Pine 3.91's occasional freezes upon
startup on DEC Alpha OSF/1 (aka Digital UNIX) and FreeBSD?  When this
problem occurs, pine is stuck in some sort of loop, using as much CPU time
as it can get, and it has apparently changed the terminal settings so ^C
won't kill it.  Nothing short of a "kill -9 <pid>" from another login 
session can kill pine when it's stuck this way.

If there are any known patches, I'd sure appreciate it if anyone could 
share a URL to them.

Thanks,
Guy Helmer

My personal preference is to have a single version of the binary that behaves
different depending on whether it's invoked as 'pine' or 'rpine', I've modified
Elm to support this behavior. Some things to be taken into account:

	* Subshells
	* Preferences settings for editor,spellcheck, paginator, etc.
	* Any function that uses system(),popen(), or execv().
	* Load/Include from file (only allow from files user owns)
	* Save to file (a thorny issue)

The same reasoning as applies to my crippled ELM (relm).

It's better to offer user's with restricted access a crippled version of a
good mail user agent than to take one of the only two other options:

	1. Don't give them any mail access at all

	2. Write an agent from scratch than only includes certain functions.

I've designed several systems intended as a BBS, where the majority of
users MUST not be able to load external files, open subshells, or pipe
messages to commands.

Using Pine, is it possible to remove the lengthy headers that are 
attached to e-mail messages?  I subscribe to a busy listserv, and would 
like to export all of my messages to a single text file -- *minus* most 
of the headers.  (It would be nice to keep the date/subject/author 
lines).  

I'm working on a Word macro that will remove the obnoxious headers, but 
have a feeling that I may be re-inventing the wheel.  Is there an easier 
way to do this?

Thanks,

Aaron Delwiche

When I send an mpeg for example Mars.mpg from Pine to myself, it encodes

type video. I can just view it by pressing return, but with the one Pine 
send I have to save it first and then view it. Is there any way to 
configure Pine to recognize mpegs when it encodes MIME mail?  I can 
successfully encode .au .jpg .ps files from Pine, and would like to be

See if the following is of any help to you:

To see a list of all available language sets on gpu, type    
locale -a       at the gpu sustem prompt.  Should be one in there
for the German character set.

Modify .pinerc to include the proper ISO-nnnn-n string in the 
character-set       option.

Then put the following in the bottom of your .cshrc file:

setenv LANG xx_xx

ie      setend LANG Fr_CA

Then logout and log back in. Then either find an article in the desired 
language to display, or create a piece of mail to yourself and try to 
look at it.

CTRL-CARET     ie     CTRL-SHIFT-6

Subject: Sorting mail  in incoming folders
Message-Id: <DD9w5C.LDE@its.csiro.au>
Date: Sun, 13 Aug 1995 23:34:23 GMT

I use Pine with multiple incoming folders with mail from
mailing lists put into their own folder using a filter.

What I would like to do is to have the mail in the alternative
folders sorted differently from the mail in INBOX. eg. I would
like to have mailing lists sorted with the "O" sort which
sorts by subject and date so it is like a threaded News listing.

I can only find provision to apply one sort criteria which applies
to all incoming mail.

The problem then is, where does Pine keep the pass phrase? If it's in
memory or a tmp file, then it's available to anybody on the
system. This is not a good thing. I have my own workstation here, I
use Pine via IMAP to read my mail. None of the other engineers here
have to ever get on my machine (they all have their own), but I still
wouldn't feel comfortable having my pass phrase sticking around all
day (I leave my Pine session up from about 8am-5pm).

 Jamey> Maybe there could be an option for Pine to not save the

If so, it should default to not keeping it and then have some sort of
timeout (say 30mins) that it will drop the phrase. By keeping the
phrase around, it defeats the purpose of having one in the first
place, at least on a multi-user system as people don't have to log in
to your console to get to the machine. Environment variables are no
better protected.

I want PGP/Pine to be easy to use, but I don't want to give up the
functionality of PGP by having Pine be too "smart", ie. keeping pass
phrases, auto-signing/decrypting messages, etc. It should always
prompt for a pass phrase.

Seems to me that you never got the whole sources ...

Speaking for elm I can say, that it comes with a nice and
complete documentation... All you need is nroff/groff to
format the manuals...

Using elm and pine is mainly a matter of taste and functionality.

I personally prefer elm with PGP patches applied, because I like
the feature of mail encryption.

Additionaly I dislike pine's automatically conversion of
special characters into quoted printable (or whatever name
that encoding has). Many other mail recipients don't have a
mailer handy, that can decode quoted printable. You can't turn
off this feature 'til pine 3.91.

I's suggest starting with elm, it has a fine documentation and
is really smart and easy to use. Start with a low user level,
so your course isn't stressed by too many options in the option
menue ...

Hi.  New to this list but seeking help.

We have been using pine on our SCO UNIX machine for about 6 months.  
All of the sudden, messages created in pine don't go anywhere.  They
look like normal, even get copied into "sent-mail" but they never really
go anywhere.  MMDF is our mail system (sorry) and with loggin turned on
high, there's not a trace of activity in MMDF.  The native mail program
works fine and pine can receive mail without problem.

Our version of pine is 3.91 and was received pre-compiled so I didn't
have the source.  I've seen this mail list mention a debug switch, -d,
but this has NO effect on my pine.  I think it was compiled without this
switch(I really don't know.)

Can someone please help me?  I'm looking for some way to effectively
trace down where the failure is.  I'm sure it's probably just a
permission setting on a directory that has been set wrong.  We did
install two operating system patches from SCO very near to the beginning
of our problem.  We're not able to remove the patches for testing and
this is a production machine so we have a lot of unhappy mail senders.

I did download the sources with the intention of building and looking
for debugging information, but the sources won't build.  Too many fatal
errors in the build ("./build sco") 

Please help!

An IMAP server has recently been setup on the Universities central
VAX VMS system. I have changed the pine configuration on our unix
boxes to do additional mail collections from
	LABEL {host}inbox
It works fine except the connection time is unacceptably long (32seconds
- 7 minutes). Telnet connections by comparison take under 1 second
so I don't think I can blame the network.

We dont use IMAP on the UNIX subnet so I've nothing to compare this too.

Does anyone know what the problem is and how to cure it.

Message-Id: <40vlsi$2ev@nntpd.lkg.dec.com>



Hi.  Eudora says that they are "compatible with UNIX mail and .mailrc files".
But I find that in a Eudora .mbx file, messages are separated by 
"<CR><NL><CR><NL>", where in Unix (PINE) files messages are separated by
"<NL><NL>".  

Consequently, PINE can't read mail files created by Eudora.  I found that
if I just strip out the extra <CR>s it works fine.  Is there any way to
change PINE's idea of what the inter-message seperator should be ?

Any other way to get PINE and Eudora to look at the same set of folders ?

Thanks in advance, 
					-Jeff

    A wealth of information on Pine is available to users with a browser
for the World Wide Web.  I am listing four URLs (Uniform Resource

the Pine Information Center at the University of Washington, the
developers and maintainers of Pine.  The second gets you to (among other 
things) information on how to filter (redistribute) incoming mail on Unix 
(R) systems.

    Answers to many questions of the "how do I do this" sort may be found
in these Web pages.  However, because I did not write any of them, I
cannot vouch for the accuracy, completeness, consistency, or timeliness
of any of the information in them.

All Pine really needs is a pipe command (from the editor) and user

whose IMAP server is being used on the VMS system? can you find out if it 
is PMDF? if it not, then what I say here may not apply.
(you can try telnet to port 143 of the server and see if the banner 
contain the word PMDF)

there are several reasons why the connection may take a while to 
establish, 

the CPU power of the system, is it a slow system? is it an Alpha or a VAX 
780? makes a big difference. How many users are usually on the system can 
also have some effect.

if CPU is not the problem, how many messages you have in the folder to be 
opened, do you have hundreds or thousands or just a few dozen? it would 
take a longer time to open a larger folder (or folder with big messages).

how much memory is on the system, is the system short on memory? messages 
are read into memory by the imap server.

disk speed, is your mail file residing on a fast disk or a slow disk or 
is the disk fragmented?

is the server configured to have a small or large working set?

7 minutes seem like a very unresonable time unless you have some really 
huge folders. It took me 21 seconds to open a folder with 1382 messages, 
some of them very large, on a moderately busy VAXstation 4000/90.

Subject: Bug (ID 1L4BW): 

Sir;
	I am writing to request help or ideas of what I can do to use
Pine on my system. I am composing this note on the Pine of my Local
Server System (Linknet.net). I have an Amiga 3000 and a US Robotics
28.8 modem.
	Pine worked fine on my system for about two weeks then suddenly
I began to get an error message when I try to use Pine from my system
[1] Obsolete ixemul.library syscall number used.                
[2]Relink program with current ixemul crt0.o and libc.a.        
then the shell that PINE is in freezes, not the computer mind   
you, just the shell. It happens when it starts up and asks      
me to login and for my password. Right after I enter my password
and hit return it freezes.                                      
	This problem started after I upgraded my EmPlant emmulator
board software. I do not know that they are related but am just
trying to tell you what the last installation was.
Pine version = 3.91
ixemul.library version = 41.1
Please suggest something I can do to fix this, I deleted Pine and
ixemul.library and restored them from tape, this did not work either.
My E-mail address is bulldog@linknet.net in case you happen to have an
idea for me to try. Thank You very much!!!

Subject: Re: computers


Hey daddy!
	I have to be writing a Final today so this will be short but sweet!  :)
Joe has a friend that sells computers in his sqadrin.  His friend can get me a
IBM with 12 mega.of ram with audio, viedo, fax/modem, cd rom, bla, bla, bla,
with a printer and lots of applications (writing) for 2200.  He is an
individual seller and fixes his computers that he sells for free if there is
problems.  If I wanted  to only spend 2,000 I would get 8 mega. of ram., which
for two hundred more I can brag to ole' pops on how fast my computer is.  I
also like the fact that I can get all the extra programs.  But before I get it,
I will look around at prices and tell you exactly what is in the package. 
Plus, If I get an IBM we can share applications and you could possibly teach me
about the computer....right...Don't worry I will be a causious buyer, and if
you think its too much for what I need, thaink about me having this for another
10 years of my life and 2,000 will be worth the money....
love you always
prune!!

ps.  Katie's computer is as good as stripped, she barly has a writing program,
plus the school of business uses IBM in their courses; so her computer is out.

Use LABEL {host:143}inbox. By default, Pine uses rsh to try to login to 
the IMAP server and if it can't get in it will then prompt for username 
and password.  The delay is probably because your IMAP server doesn't 
have rsh enabled due to security, and it is timing out after about 30 
seconds.  I had the same problem and couldn't find host:port documented. 
143 is the socket the the IMAP server listens on.  Specifying this tells 
it to connect directly to the socket without trying to use rsh first.

Just to explain -- I made the original comment --
I'm afraid I regard nroff as obsolete,
and don't consider documentation in this format
to be adequate.

Maybe that is a very unusual perception.

Is there ia way in Pine 3.91 to change the From: line on outgoing mail? 
Adding it as a customized headre want do, and changing the from: line is 
certainly easier for the reciever than having a reply-to line.
If not in Pine, can I change my Sendmail config to do it?

This is trivial to implement.  I've a patch (not ready for prime-time 
yet) that handles public- and private-key encryption, signing, and 
decryption in pico.

However, the way I'm doing it compromises one's passphrase in a 
multiuser environment (the passphrase will appear on a process list).  I 
need to spend an hour or so and find a good workaround for this.

This one is a little harder to implement -- I'm still working on it.

I can make this patch available to interested parties when I'm finished 
(probably by the end of this weekend).

When I "attach" a file in 3.91, the file is actually becoming part of the 
body of the message.  What I would like is for that attachment to "realy" 
be one.

I have received messages with attachements into my box.

I have not found the right combination in the setup to achieve this.

Any hints?

Thanks,

Abraham

Why does it matter how the documentation is marked up so long as you can
easily print it? Personally I agree that *roff is an abomination but no
long as no one asks me to use it to write my documentations I don't care
if others choose to. It does have the unparalled advantage that it is
available on most UNIX systems.

Complaining about Elm's documentaion because it is marked up using *roff
is a bit like saying that the wine is no good because the bottle is
covered with dust and cobwebs.

Cheers, Russell.

How do you stop Unix Pine from saving a copy of every message sent into 
the Fcc folder?

Help in setup/config says to use  ""  as the "default Fcc folder name.  but 
that just causes a folder called "" to be created.

Thanks.

The method to do this is described in Pine Technical Notes, Section 7.

Find the distribution file pine3.91/pine/osdep/os-xxx.h and remove the 
commentary char from the line:

#define ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM  /* comment out to not allow changing From */

and then recompile pine.

Then you may set up your mail headers including From: from within the Pine 
setup menu.

Among other activities, my group supports e-mail on PC's and
UNIX systems for about 70 users (faculty, staff, and graduate
students).  On the UNIX system, which accounts for about 95%
of all our groups e-mail, both elm and pine are available.

Virtually all our users chose pine, primarily because it is easier
to learn.  Even a few users who were already familiar with elm
on another campus system moved to pine once we set up our system
about four years ago.  At that time, the following elements made
pine the choice:

  - Far easier addressbook manipulation.  It was (and is) well integrated
    into the pine system, it was full-screen, and generally very easy to
    update and modify.

  - Far easier folder manipulation.  Again, it was full screen, and again
    the ability to manipulate folders, was far superior to the version of
    elm we used at that time.

  - Easier access to, and better self-documentation of the configuration 
    file.

  - Pine could read, and post to, newsgroups then.  To the best of my 
    knowledge, elm couldn't.

Features that the current version of pine has that are important to us
include:

  - MIME

  - IMAP (as we begin to shift the locus of our mail user agents to the desktop).

Many people seem to be advocating using mkpgp until pgp is integrated 
into pine.   What is mkpgp and where can it be found?

Thanks

I am trying trying to use Pine as a client to Carnegy Mellon's Cyrus IMAP4
mail server (version 1.3).  I am running into some anomalies doing this.

I would appreciate mail from anyone who has experience on this subject.
Gory details will follow if requested. :-)

Subject: [Unix Pine 3.91] Selection of message headers in regular display?
Date: 18 Aug 1995 12:57:14 -0400
Message-Id: <s5uka8bcfpx.fsf@coil.nist.gov>

Howdy.  I've got another feature request.  It stems from wanting to
see the 'X-organization:' header line in my regular message display.
Ie, not have to switch to full-headers to see this non-standard (but
typically present) header line.  More generally, i think it would be
worthwhile to enable the user to specify optional headers which they
would like to have included among the select set.

I looked through the code a bit, and it appears that the brief-header-
mode is restricted to a small, hard-coded selection of standard header
lines.  (c-client/rfc822.c:rfc822_header() and
pine/mailview.c:format_envelope() seem to be the relevant routines.)

Is there any way, currently, that i can extend that list at
the user level?  If not, are there any plans to make this more user
configurable?  I'd certainly like to be able to see the
X-Organization: line, when it is present, and i think there will be
other, similar needs.

Thanks.

You can have pine change the FROM line as a customized header IF that 
functionality is compiled into pine.  The file you need to change is: 

pine3.91/pine/osdep/os-xxx.h

Just change the flag ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM and recompile.

Or, you can have sendmail do this by using the sendmail USERDB option.  
However, for the USERDB option to work with pine, a little more work is 
involved than what the sendmail docs describe, since sendmail expects 
mail to be changed by the database to be of the from "FROM: user" instead 
of pine's default of "FROM: user@localhost".  Maybe 3.92 will have a 
configuration option to fix this? (HOPEFULLY!)  But until then, you can 
do the following:

Compile sendmail with Berkley's USERDB option defined.  (If your running 
Linux, you can get a precompiled binary from 
lss.afit.af.mil:/pub/Linux/system/Mail/delivery/sendmail-8.6.12b-bin.tgz)

Replace your existing sendmail and makemap binaries with the new ones.

Then follow the instructions included in that to set it up with the 
USERDB feature, or, follow the below from the FAQ:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  * How do I rewrite my From: lines to read ``First_Last@My.Domain''?

        There are a couple of ways of doing this.  This describes using
        the "user database" code.  This is still experimental, and was
        intended for a different purpose -- however, it does work
        with a bit of care.  It does require that you have the Berkeley
        "db" package installed (it won't work with DBM).

        First, create your input file.  This should have lines like:

                loginname:mailname      First_Last
                First_Last:maildrop     loginname

        Install it in (say) /etc/userdb.  Create the database:

                makemap btree /etc/userdb.db < /etc/userdb
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In your /etc/sendmail.cf file, add the following line before the 
rulesets.  (I put mine right after the line saying "Kdequote dequote" and 
before the "Special Macros" section"):


# Define our userdb file for pine rewrites
Kuserdb btree -o /etc/userdb.db



Then, add the following ruleset #1.  (I put mine right after Ruleset 0):

##################################################
### Ruleset 1, rewrite sender header & envelope ##
##################################################
#Thanks to Bjart Kvarme <bjart.kvarme@usit.uio.no>
S1
R$- < @ $=w . > $*      $: $1 < @ $2 . > $3 ?? $1       username@localhost ?
R$+ ?? $+               $: $1 ?? $(userdb $2 : mailname $: @ $)
R$+ ?? @                $@ $1                           Not found
R$+ ?? $+               $>3 $2                          Found, rewrite

#NOTE      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#          Use Tab Characters  Use Tab Characters in these regions
# to make three columns (the line with "mailname" only has 2 columns).

This is how mine is set up and it works great without having to alter 
pine's code.

Also, if you have a "SLIP" or "PPP" connection, another good thing to do 
in the /etc/sendmail.cf file is to move the line for the nameserver 
lookup in ruleset 96 to the bottom of the ruleset so that your local mail 
can be delivered even when you don't have a connection to a nameserver.  
The key two lines to move to the bottom of the ruleset are:

# pass to name server to make hostname canonical
R$* < @ $* $~P > $*             $: $1 < @ $[ $2 $3 $] > $4


Obviously, recompiling pine would be the easiest solution.  The benefit 
of fixing up sendmail to do this is that your mail will always have the 
correct from line regardless of which mailer you use (pine, elm, mh).  
Another plus is that your sent-mail folder will continue to say 
"TO: whomever" instead of just filling the from column with your name.

Hope this helps.

Hello,

We were successfully using Pine 3.89 and the .pinerc  user-id=  command to 
spoof mail so that it looked like it all came from one account.  We recently 
upgraded to Pine 3.91 and the .pinerc user-id= command is no longer working, 
so the mail that is replied to is being sent to incorrect accounts.  We have 
several users responding to the mail, and it needs to appear as if it is all 
coming from one single account.  Thanks...

I have a strange problem with Pine not being able to write its debug file 
when prompted.  Using "pine -d9 user@address" or "pine -d 9 user@address" 
will start Pine, but no debug files are written.  I believe that the 
default location is to the user's home directory.  I've looked there and 
on the whole filesystem for .pine-debugX, with no luck.  I can't find 
anything in the pine.conf that controls how the debug file are written.  
The rest of Pine works great.  any ideas ?

Sorry to clog things up with such as this, but:
Could someone tell me where I could locate a PINE
FAQ?  I've been trying to run PINE on my VAX account
and none of my commands are working properly (through
my dial-up connection using Procomm Plus on a PC). I'd
like to try to look at some docs and figure out why.
Went to ftp.cac.washington.edu but pine-info would
not download because it is a "plain" file.  Don't
understand....

Message-Id: <413208$apc$1@mhadf.production.compuserve.com>

I'm trying to 'build sv4' for PINE 3.91 on a NCR Tower 32 model 
400 which is a 6-7 year old system running AT7T System V Release 
3.0. 

I have a few questions which hopefully someone can answer.

- Is there an 'old' version of PINE that ran under SVR3?
- In 3.91 is there a 'preferred' build that should be selected, 
ie 'build sco' to run under SVR3?
- Are there other 'free' mail frontends more suited to SVR3?
- Is this a lost cause?

Thanks,

Stuart

The Pine FAQ is available in several forms.  If you are using Pine (or
other IMAP client) on a system connected to the Internet, you can read
it as a folder-collection adding a folder-collections entry of

	"Pine FAQ" *{pine.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/docs/faq/[]

in the Setup/Config screen or your .pinerc file.

It is also available via anonymous ftp in

	ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs/faq.mbox

and in the Pine Information Center,

	http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine

You can also send a message to pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu
which will send you a copy via email.

It sounds like you have a version of Pine with debugging tyurned off
at compile time...

   And while I am at it can anyone tell me if Pine.AMI.3.91 (Amiga)
   has the experimental POP driver.  Galactica isn't running IMAP
   "yet" and before I get POP service, which is extra; I want to
   know how I can handle incoming mail.

   I do have popd (pop3) installed and a program called AmiPOP which
   connects to netserver and could download mail to UUMail:stom. Will
   Pine recognize this mail, if I can't get:"{192.106.152.1/pop3}inbox"
   to work?

   It is really a pleasure to work with Pine and I hope to use it
   fully in the future.............Stan

   PS..and how does one set the GMT?

	Try adding -Dconst= to the CFLAGS= line of the makefile.  A similar
error occurs when building for Solaris and this fixes it.

    Normally I save my outgoing mail in some folder or other, but when I

mkpgp is a c-shell script which serves as a liaison for the Pine 
mailer/news reader and pgp.

It features: external editor of your choice, external spell checker of
your choice, encryption (with or without signing), signing (with or
without encryption), encrypted attachments selected via browser,
effortless public key additions from e-mail, decryption & signature
verification, effortless encrypted attachment extraction, and more... 

To get mkpgp, send blank e-mail to slutsky@lipschitz.sfasu.edu with

	Subject: mkpgp

A signed, ascii-armored message should show up in you mailbox within the 
hour.

Process the message with "pgp -p" to produce mkpgp.message.  Read 
mkpgp.message.

(You can add my keys with
              finger deviate@lipschitz.sfasu.edu | pgp -fka
before you process the message if you want to check the signature.)

To receive updates, send blank e-mail to slutsky@lipschitz.sfasu.edu with
	Subject: addtomkpgplist
mkpgp will show up each time the modification date changes.

You might prefer to run emacs as an alt-editor, and use MailCrypt:

Mailcrypt is an Emacs lisp package which provides a simple interface
to cryptographic functions with PGP.  It was written by Patrick
LoPresti (patl@lcs.mit.edu) and Jin Choi (jin@atype.com).

The latest version of Mailcrypt is always (?) available through the
Mailcrypt home page at `http://cag-www.lcs.mit.edu/mailcrypt/'.  An
FTP mirror is at `ftp://cag.lcs.mit.edu/pub/patl/'.

To install the Mailcrypt package on your system, follow the directions
in the file `INSTALL'.

To hook Mailcrypt into your mail and news browsers, follow the
directions in the "Installation" section of the Mailcrypt manual.  If
you don't know how to use the Emacs Info browser, you should learn;
type `C-h i' and poke around.  You can read the Info version of the
Mailcrypt manual by doing `C-u C-h i' on the file `mailcrypt.info'.

Or read the HTML version of the manual which is directly accessible
from the Mailcrypt home page.

To automatically be informed of improvements to Mailcrypt, add
yourself to the (very low volume) Mailcrypt announcement list.  Send
Email to mc-announce-request@cag.lcs.mit.edu with a request to be
added.

Send all bug reports and comments to the authors.  And most of all,
enjoy!

	I believe he is asking if pine can decode  a uuencoded file.

	The answer is , yes.  Simply pipe "|" the message to uudecode.
Make sure the | command is enabled in the configuration

   ** And while I am at it can anyone tell me if Pine.AMI.3.91
   has the experimental POP driver.  Galactica isn't running IMAP
   "yet" and before I get POP service, which is extra; I want to
   know how I can handle incoming mail.

   ** I do have popd (pop3) installed and a program called AmiPOP which
   connects to netserver and could download mail to UUMail:stom, which
   I designated as  INBOX. Will Pine recognize this as mail or give me
   an INBOX (Read Only), which wouldn't be the end of the world because
   I could respond anyway...only the subject becomes INBOX etc...I did
   set incoming-folders: {192.106.152.1/pop3}inbox...and hope if I get
   an affermative to the "pop driver" question everything will be simp-
   lified.

   ** How can I set the GMT instead of "+0000 ()"?

   For the timebeing I get my mail QWKed to me.

   It is really a pleasure to work with Pine and I hope to use it
   fully in the future.............Stan

Is there a way to share a personal address book between PC-Pine and Unix?  I 
get file permission errors on the Unix file when I configure PC-Pine ( 
{mailhost}addrbook )

Thanks in advance,

In my experience this is usually caused by the program having declarations
for these functions that do not match the prototype in the system header
files.  Try grep'ing for them in the .h files and/or the addrbook.c file
itself.  (I've never built pine myself so I can't be very sure about this.)

Pine can't send MIME mail.
The "exmh" does it perfectly.

Excuse me?  Pine has supported MIME since before exmh existed.

Message-Id: <eeggert-1908951108400001@port9.annex2.nwlink.com>

I have been unsuccessful with building Pine. I'm attempting to build pine
3.91 on my PB165C running MachTen 2.2.

 Below is the error I get when attempting to build Pine --

      # build bsd
        make args are "CC=cc"

        c-client: File exists
        imapd: File exists
        Making c-client library, mtest and imapd
        build: /home/root/Pine/pine3.91/imap: bad directory


Is bsd the correct platform to use with the build command?

Any suggestions appreciated. Thanks.

May be I didn't understand it correctly, I just assumed this because nobody
can answer my question, AND in the main page it says:
Pine's message composer does not have integral multimedia capability......

Multimedia/wysiwig composing and MIME encoding/labelling are two
independent concepts.  You can have either one without the other.

Using MIME encoding, Pine allows you to attach any type of file and
deliver it without corruption.

I've just found out why pine takes so long to startup and close down.
It is not because it is waiting for mailbox-access.
It is not because my machine is slow.
It is not because it is cracking passwords.
It is not because it is calculating mandelbrots.
It is not because it ...

No!! It is because it is sleep()ing!

Maybe it was an idea to make a no-sleep variable.
Or only display important messages (It's the reversed oneline-messages
that has a min-display-time attached to it).
Disabling (setting min-display-time to 0) 5 of the messages changed
pine's startup+closedown time from 7 to 2 seconds. So now it is just
as fast as elm.

  Now I just have to find out how to redesign the key-mapping....

And after you've installed procmail you can find out lots of info about

I'll start posting it again regularly soon.  I haven't posted it

I explained that my comment was personal,
and quite likely does not apply to others.
In brief, I want to distribute the documents to 250 users,
and I don't have a high-quality nroff/troff to PostScript driver
on my system.

I did in fact print out the elm and pine documents
on my Linux box.
I didn't think either set of documents was very good.
Just my opinion.

I would have preferred documentation in LaTeX or texinfo format.
Just my preference.

Incidentally, I received about a dozen replies,
10--2 in favour of pine,
nearly always on the grounds that it was easier for beginners.

     `joe' is a *great* text editor that is simple like `pico', but as

     great...It's available for UNIX, but I doubt it's available for

Does anyone have a script to translate a elm adressbook (aliases) into
a pine adressbook (.adressbook) format ?

Thanks.

Here's a quoted message from someone having trouble. Any ideas?

"I am having a consistent problem with Pine at home. Each time that I try
to print messages of any length (over 2 or 3 Pine screens worth), my
printout is not complete. I am using the "Y" command to print entire
documents since I can no longer scroll back through the buffer
highlighting the specific text that I want to print. I have tried other
VersaTerm options such as saving stream, etc., but the saved text has all
manner of codes at the start of lines and repeated text (Pine seems to
repeat the last line or so from the previous screen at the top of the next
screen)."

Thanks,

bob

Thanks to all who replied.

Solution was to add -Dconst= to the definition of the CFLAGS line

it then compiles easily

The following is from the Pine 3.91 Help pages, and it's helped a few of 
our users experiencing similar problems to Bob's:

--- start insert ------

CONTROL KEYS NOT USED BY PINE:  Most commands in Pine are single letters,
with --we hope-- some mnemonic value, but in places where Pine is expecting
text input, e.g. in the composer or at prompts for file/folder names,
control keys must be used for editing and navigation functions.

Pine has used nearly all the control keys available.  There are, however,
certain control keys that are reserved by other programs or for technical
reasons.  Pine does not use any of these keys:
                Ctrl-S    Used by Unix as "stop output"
                Ctrl-Q    Used by Unix as "resume output"
                Ctrl-]    Often used by Telnet as escape key
                Ctrl-\   Often used by Unix as "Abort"
                ESC       Conflicts with sequences used for arrow keys

Note: by default, Pine treats Ctrl-S or Ctrl-Q (sometimes known as XOFF
and XON), as normal characters, even though Pine does not use them.
However, the printer, modem, or communication software you are using may
be configured for "software flow control" which means that XON/XOFF must
be treated as special characters by the operating system.  If you see
messages such as "^X not defined for this screen", or if messages
printed via the "attached-to-ansi" option are missing pieces, then your
system is probably using software flow control. In this case you will need
to set the "preserve-start-stop-characters" feature.  If you *do* set this
feature, be advised that if you accidentally hit a Ctrl-S, Pine will
mysteriously freeze up with no warning.  In this case, try typing a Ctrl-Q
and see if that puts things right.

On a system I help admin on, one of our users received the following message:

I'll include the .pine-crash file below, but I'm wondering if anyone can 
tell me what happened and if it's a setup problem on my end, what I 
should do to fix it. TIA

Subject: Is there a version of pine for Windows?

Message-Id: <4186o6$b5k@hyppy.systemy.it>

Hi, I'm using Eudora 1.4.4 at the moment, but since I am writing a
book on Internet tools, I would like to give a good picture of what's
available. Do you know whether anyone has ported pine to either
Windows, NT or Windows 95? I know about elm, but the Windows version
is crufty (sorry, developers, but it is).

Thanks for your help.

Pine does not currently support remote addressbooks, unless you have

I had a similar question about Samba on SCO, and was directed to
ftp.celestial.com (/pub/sco-ports/xenix, I think).  Have a look
there for compiled binaries of various programs.  I would think that
if they don't have it, it doesn't exist!  Well, almost...anyway,
good luck.

There is no need for a pop3 daemon if all you are doing is connecting to 
a mail server to read mail. The daemon is used when other people connect 
to your computer to fetch their mail. Pine does it own negociation of the 
POP protocol.

Amiga Pine does cooperate well with AmiPOP. This is one of the new 
features I implemented.

You need to set the TZ variable. Eg for EDT (4 hours before GMT) you 
would type "setenv TZ EDT-4" (The Amiga seems to have this backwards). 
Other timezones are similar.

I just moved up to pine 3.91 from a much older version (pre MIME 
capabilities) and I am having some problems with attaching files.  Pine 
is MIMEing all attached files whether they are binary or plain text.  
I don't know whether it is supposed to do this or not.  It makes sense on 
binary files, but not on plain text.  

My problem is that most of the people I know do not use pine.  So, I can 
not attach any text files to my mail since pine MIMEs them.  Is there any 
way to shut off the MIME abilities of pine?  I guess my other option is 
convince everyone else to use pine, but they seem to be set in their ways...

Hi,

   I'm using Pine 3.91 on a black NeXT 3.2 and I've noticed that when mail
send from my machine is read on certain mailers (generic 'mail', mail 
programs on IBM mainframes and VAX machines) sometimes the characters
=20 appear at the end of lines. This only happens sometimes and I've not
found a pattern yet.

I assume this is some type of control code or something. Has anyone else seen
this, and is there a way to make it stop?

Thanks,

You can also use wincode if you are using PC-Pine. It hooks right into 
pine and will encode and decode as well as zip. It will also call up the 
viewer on the fly (i.e. Word Perfect, Lotus, whatever)

Thanks to those who helped me with my "pine stopped sending mail" 
problem.  The system's default smtp server was no longer and I had to 
specify a server in /usr/local/lib/pine.conf.  Everyone is happy now.

I have alwasy been bugged by the fact that pine displays mail created by 
Eudora as being dated "xxx -1".  Is there a reason for this?  I've looked 
at the headers (rich headers on) and don't see a date field.  Is this 
Eudora's fault?  Does anyone know how to make Eudora send a date header?

Looking for clues...

Date: 21 Aug 1995 22:31:28 GMT
Message-Id: <41b1g0$6o6@usenet.ucs.indiana.edu>

I work at the UCS Support Center at Indiana University.  A user wishes
to sort his messages by "arrival" date/time, and not "date" (i.e.,
date/time sent).  Pine's online help says that "arrival" sorts by the
date the message arrived in one's mailbox.  What that seems to mean is
that it sorts based on the time a message is moved into a specific folder.

Example: Set sort order to "arrival".  Move a rather old message into
a folder which contains newer messages.  The old message will appear
at the bottom of the list, as though it arrived recently.  In fact, it
*did* arrive recently into that folder.  Is it possible to sort based
on the date/time that a message arrived on one's account, regardless
of which folder the message is moved to?

Are there others out there frustrated (and misled) by this behavior?

Thanks.

Add my vote for Pine, but for the reason that it's more 
powerful than Elm.  I used Elm for years but as soon as
Pine 3.91 was released I jumped ship (tree) for Pine!

I have similar problems sometimes...it seems to be connected with the 
length of the file, and the printer having consequent problems keeping up 
with the "download".
   Can your friend handle the matter by using the E(xport) function to 
create a separate file, and downloading that for later printing?

Using groff -Tps you can easily produce Postscript output if you
need. But as Russel already stated out, you _can_ print the docu
and read it after that. The printed document is nicely formatted,
that counts !

I read the FAQ, but I couldn't figure out how to set pine.conf.fixed so 
that users could not make _any_ alterations via the setup|config options.

Also, since most users will be logging in remotely, I would like to 
totally disable printing.  Is that possible through the fixed config file?

Thanks!

Hi Wil,

have tou tried to put the print commands (printer and personal-print-command) in there, 
pointing to any shellscript that does not print but notify the user that printing is disabled?

Ciao,

Sure, that's an option.  I was hoping there would be a setting somewhere
that would smooth the receipt of the information pine is sending (although
admittedly I haven't tried *everything*). Versaterm generally has no
problem printing from pine otherwise, so I suppose the problem might be
related to the phone line transmission somehow. 

Although this problem didn't occur when Versaterm was used over the same 
phone lines to print from allin1 on a VAX...

I'm thinking of gettint the source and recompiling Pine with the print 
(and other options) totally disabled.

Hi all,
	Can someone tell me how to connect pine to a Internet service provider's SMTP mail server ? There is a POP account in there.
	I know how to change the INBOX but how can I exchange my USR ID and password to the mail server?
	Thanks,

    To the best of my knowledge, no current version of Pine allows you to
do what you want WITHOUT using export/readfile.  Personally, I think this
is a design shortcoming of an otherwise fine product.  Export/readfile can
simply be a pain, but there is currently no way around it, so far as I
know.  (Pine Development Team, are you listening?)

Do I need NNTP to use Pine for local-only newsgroup reading & posting?
Does anyone have some advice about using Pine in this way?  We don't
need USENET or any outside news source, in fact, our machine is not

Is there any keycommand (other than expunge) that will force pine to go 
look for new mail in the INBOX.  I know of new mail arriving (message at 
top of terminal) before pine figures it out.  If I go to the inbox and 
eXpunge deleted messages, it will re-read INBOX.  But I also have to read 
that there is nothing to expunge.  Not too bad, but I'd rather discover a 
"re-read INBOX" command key.

Dave,

if you move your cursor PAST the last mail PINE will look for new mails. (There is another 
trick which I've forgotten)

Those of you who use a BinHex decoder for unix, what decoder are you 
using?  Are there different kinds?  If there are different BinHex 
formats, do they handle all those formats?  I assume once you install 
your decoder, in a mailer like pine, you simply (V)iew the attachment 
then (|)Pipe it to the decoder.  Is that right?  Thanks for any help or 
information you can provide.

We're experiencing problems with printing to an attached printer.  We use 
a DEC Alpha (Digital Unix v3.2a) and Pine 3.91.  It only happens on 
connections through our terminal servers (which have done this type of 
thing for years and years) and the message will occasionally just quit 
printing after a page or so.  Has anyone else on an Alpha run into this 
type of situation?  Please respond to me directly as I'm not yet a member 
of the list.  Thanks in advance.

If you have the "enable-aggregate-cmd-set" feature selected in the
Setup/Config screen, you can select several messages, then use "ar"
(apply reply) or "af" (apply forward) to reply to, or forward, all of
them and include the text.  Then edit the message and/or headers to

I have a client that needs pine working on an AT&T Unix box on a PC.

They don't have a <netdb.h> and gethostent() type things that pine wants.  
Is there some way to get around this completely, ie, no networking stuff at 
all, just use it as a mailer?

I can always bash the code I guess and fake something up, but I'd rather not.

let me know.

Thanks.

Date: Tue, 10 Feb 95 15:40:48 -0800
From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is Pine?

Pine(tm) --a Program for Internet News & Email-- is a tool for reading,
sending, and managing electronic messages.  It was designed specifically
with novice computer users in mind, but can be tailored to accommodate the
needs of power users as well.  Pine uses Internet message protocols
(e.g. RFC822, SMTP, MIME, IMAP, and NNTP) and runs on Unix, MS-DOS, and
MS Windows. 
  
The guiding principles for Pine's user-interface were:  careful limitation
of features, one-character mnemonic commands, always-present command
menus, immediate user feedback, and high tolerance for user mistakes.  It
is intended that Pine can be learned by exploration rather than reading
manuals.  It has the ability to perform full screen editing of messages,
include and extract attachments (such as Word or Excel files), and other
advanced message system features. 

Pine uses IMAP for accessing message folders on remote computers and MIME
for sending multimedia or other binary files as attachments to normal
messages.

Date: Tue, 10 Feb 95 15:40:48 -0800
From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is MIME?

MIME (RFC1521) stands for "Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions". It is
an Internet standard which allows transfer of binary files
(word-processing documents, spreadsheets, images, sounds, etc) between any
compliant mailers. You can get technical information about MIME from the
RFC. Ongoing discussion on MIME takes place in the newsgroup
comp.mail.mime. There is also a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) list that
is posted regularly to comp.mail.mime, comp.answers and news.answers.

Content-Description: What is IMAP?
Content-Type: MESSAGE/RFC822

Date: Tue, 10 Feb 95 15:40:48 -0800
From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is IMAP?

IMAP stands for "Internet Message Access Protocol". An IMAP client program
on any platform at any location on the Internet can access email folders
on an IMAP server. While the messages appear to be local, they reside on
the server until the client explicitly moves or deletes them.  The IMAP
protocol is a functional (but incompatible) superset of POP. A principal
advantage of IMAP over POP is that it permits using more than one computer
to access your mail.  Using multiple computers with POP typically results
in your mail ending up scattered across all of those computers. Another
key advantage is IMAP's ability to selectively access parts of messages,
e.g. you don't have to wait for a 2MB audio attachment to be retrieved
until you specifically ask for it.  This is a big win over low-speed (e.g.
dialup) connections.  For a detailed comparison of IMAP and POP, see the
paper "Comparing Two Approaches to Remote Mailbox Access: IMAP vs. POP." 
It is available from: 

	ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap.vs.pop
  
IMAP is what allows Pine (or any other IMAP client) to access email on a
remote mail server, usually one that is shared (central or departmental). 
The current IMAP4 Proposed Standard is described in RFC1730.  Additional
information is included in RFC1731, RFC1732, and RFC1733.

Subject: How many sites use Pine?

Based on the number of people getting copies of Pine and its
documentation, we know for sure that Pine is used at over 12,000 sites in
60 different countries.  We do not have any way to count the exact number
of sites using Pine or the total number of users, but we estimate that 
well over one million people use Pine right now (12/94).  People are still
jumping on the Pine bandwagon -- about 4,000 new users each day -- so any
guess about the number of people who use Pine today will surely be too
small tomorrow.

Put addresses and/or list from your address book in the Bcc: (blind carbon

compose the message, but they are erased before arriving in other people's
INBOXes. The Bcc: header is not displayed automatically in the default

Content-Description: How can I filter messages into different incoming folders?
Content-Type: MESSAGE/RFC822

Date: Tue, 10 Feb 95 15:40:48 -0800
From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>, Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: How can I filter messages into different incoming folders?

                                       

Pine does not do delivery filtering. That function is done by other
programs, such as "procmail" or "filter" or "deliver" or "mailagent." 
   
Once you have set-up your delivery filtering, e.g. via the "procmail"
program, then you will have new mail arriving in several different
mailboxes/folders, in addition to your INBOX. 
   
So then the question becomes, how do you access those new "incoming
message" folders that your favorite delivery filter program has created?

One solution is to just access them the same way you access your other
mail folders.  If they are in your default folder directory (usually
$HOME/mail) then just type L to list your folders and select the folder
you'd like to view.  If they are in a different directory, for example
$HOME/mail/IN, add that directory to your folder-collections by putting
this into your .pinerc: 

folder-collections=mail/[],
        mail/IN/[],

And then when you list your folders by typing L the mail/IN directory will
be in your list. 

Another solution is to use Pine's incoming-folders variable.  With this
method you can use the Tab key to tab through new messages in all your
incoming folders.  When you are at the last new message in one incoming
folder pressing the Tab key will move you to the next incoming folder with
a new message. 

Here is part of a sample .pinerc for setting up incoming folders: 
 
incoming-folders=Art151           {warhol.art.nowhere.edu}IN/art151,
                 Art-L            {warhol.art.nowhere.edu}IN/Art-L,
                 Old-Student-Acct {fozzie.elsewhere.edu}INBOX

In this case, the pinerc entries presume that your delivery filtering
program has been configured to put mail relating to the Art151 class into
the folder "IN/art151" and mail relating to the Art-L mailing list into
"IN/Art-L". 
   
>From the Folders List screen, you can then easily access those folders.
Eventually we will have a way to indicate which of these may have new mail
waiting for you, so that you don't forget that you have more than one
place to look for new mail.

Date: Tue, 10 Feb 95 15:40:48 -0800
From: Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: How do I define my own headers like Reply-To and Organization?

                                       

In Pine 3.90, and later versions, you can set Reply-To, Organization,
and other headers using the customized-hdrs variable.

1. From the Main Menu type s for Setup
2. Type c for Configuration
3. To change the value of the customized-hdrs variable:
   a) To use the Where command type: w
   b) At the prompt type: customized-hdrs
   c) To Add a value type: a
   d) At the prompt type: Organization: Your Organization Name
   e) Repeat steps c and d for other headers such ast Reply-To

   Note that Pine understands environment variables so you
   can use lines like the following (if the variables are set):
      Organization: $ORGANIZATION
      Reply-To: $REPLYTO

While reading a message that you've received you can view all headers by 
typing h.  If h does not work you need to go to your configuration menu and 
set the enable-full-header-cmd variable.

While composing a message you can view all the headers by placing the cursor
in the header region and typing ^R (view rich headers).

Customized headers are not available in Pine 3.89 and earlier.

Subject: How can I read a ROT13 encoded message?

                                       

When viewing the message, use the '|' (Pipe) command and give it the
following: 

        tr '[A-Za-z]' '[N-ZA-Mn-za-m]'

You could also write a script, maybe called unrot, that does this and then
pipe the message to the script. 

In order for the pipe command to work you need to be using Pine 3.90 or 
higher and have the enable-unix-pipe-cmd variable set.

Content-Description: Can I eliminate the @host.domain from local addresses?
Content-Type: MESSAGE/RFC822

Date: Tue, 10 Feb 95 15:40:48 -0800
From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Can I eliminate the @host.domain from local addresses?

This is not a new idea.  It's a very old idea, in fact, and just about
everyone who has ever dealt with email has had it at one time or another. 
Regretably, it has come to be recognized as a bad idea.  Here's why: 

An email address without a host name is not syntactically valid according
to RFC822.  Now, it is true that RFC822 only specifies what must be done
in messages which are transmitted over the network, and that strictly
local messages are not under RFC822's dictates. 

This means that there are two formats of email, one that conforms to
RFC822 and one that does not.  Careful efforts must be made to ensure that
the non-conforming mail format never escapes the local system onto the
network. Twenty years' of experience has shown that it is impossible to
guarantee that the non-conforming format does not escape into the network,
even in the face of traps to catch such messages on their way out and
convert them to RFC822 conforming format.  Indeed, such traps have often
contributed additional problems on their own. 

The non-conforming format is ambiguous as to what host is intended.
Although the off-the-cuff solution (and the one that everyone implements)
is ``use the local host'', numerous examples have occurred in which this
leads to wrong behavior.  For example, it may be the ``local mail center''
instead of the ``local machine which is a single-user workstation''.  Or,
if a one of the non-conforming messages escaped on to the network, it's
some remote system and we have no idea at all what system that may be! 
There's no way for the mail reader to tell; a human may infer from context
but often does so by using information that is not available to the
program. 

The Pine team has spent long (and at times heated) meetings reviewing this
issue, before coming to the conclusion (as other email groups have
independently done) that it's a no-win situation.  The policy of the email
development community for 15 years (since the RFC733 discussions) has been
to exterminate the non-conforming format by not implementing it in modern
mail tools. 

It may be feasible to implement a feature in a future version of Pine that
would suppress the display of the local host name in email addresses. That
is, the host name would still be in the file on disk, but would not show
up on the screen.  We'll consider it, but we have a large list of very
high priority tasks which must be done first.

Why use Ispell with Pine (and Pico)?
------------------------------------

 - it allows you to add words to a private dictionary so that your name
   (technical words, etc.) will not be reported as errors;

 - it offers correct spellings for misspelled words, and you can 
   select one of the offered alternatives by pressing a single key;

 - it spell checks the document from top to bottom (rather than jumping
   around in alphabetical order) so you can anticipate the next words to 
   be checked;

 - because it checks from top to bottom, you can stop the program after
   checking your reply (at the top) without checking the message you are
   replying to.


How do I use Ispell with Pine (after it is installed) ?
-------------------------------------------------------

After you have installed Ispell in pine, when you are entering a message
into the pine composer and the cursor is in the "Message Text" area of the
screen, you can press ^_ (Control-underscore), to check the spelling of
your message.  The message header cannot be spell-checked.  

Inside the ispell program, you can press the following keys: 
   ?      Help for ispell
   space  Accept the word - this time only
   A      Accept the word - for the rest of the file (message)
   I      Accept the word - and Insert it in your private dictionary
   0-9    Replace the word with one of the suggested alternatives
   R      Replace the word completely (then you enter the replacement)
   Q      Quit checking this file - corrections will be saved
   X      Exit immediately - corrections will be lost

If the spell check halts and you see "(INTERRUPT)" in the upper-left
corner of the screen, just press the <SpaceBar> to continue.  Generally
when this happens, the spell check is complete.  See 'man ispell' for 
more information on the ispell program. 


How do I install Ispell in Pine ?
---------------------------------

There are a couple ways to use Ispell within Pine; method #1 is usually
all you need to do.  It's very easy; just follow the instructions below. 


PINE -- METHOD #1:
Set your alternate-editor to ispell, then you can press ^_ 
(Control-underscore) in the composer to invoke ispell. 
To do this, follow these steps (press the "key" in each step):

 - Check to be sure that the ispell program is installed on your system,
   and use the correct directory path; at the unix prompt, enter the 
   command: 'which ispell'.  The following instructions assume output 
   from this command was '/usr/local/bin/ispell'.
 - start the 'pine' program
 - from the "M"ain-Menu of pine
 - press "S"etup
 - then "C"onfig
 - then "W"hereIs and enter 'editor' (without the ' marks) 
   and press <ENTER>
 - press "W"hereIs and <ENTER> until you find the line:
      editor = <No Value Set>
 - press "A"dd-Value, and enter '/usr/local/bin/ispell' (without 's)
   and press <ENTER>
 - you should now see:
      editor = /usr/local/bin/ispell
 - if so, press "E"xit-Config, and you are done!

You can still press ^T to use the standard pine spell-checking program
(which will -not- use your personal dictionary, and will not offer 
suggestions for correct spelling).


PINE -- METHOD #2:
Pine already checks the SPELL environment variable to locate the spell 
checking program, so you can create the following script and name it 
'spell': 

        #!/bin/sh
        ispell -l

To make ^T in pine use 'ispell' and your private dictionary: 
  - make the above script file 'spell' in your home directory 
  - make it executable: 'chmod u+x spell' 
  - set the environment variable SPELL: 'setenv SPELL $HOME/spell' 
    (include this command in your .profile, .cshrc or .login file) 

Now, when you press ^T in pine, you will execute the ispell program, and
it will recognize words stored in your private dictionary.  The screen
display will look like pine is using the standard spell-checking program,
except words will be checked from top to bottom in the message, rather
than in alphabetical sequence.  This method does not allow you to Insert
words into your private dictionary.  However, this might be useful with a
central script file (setenv SPELL ...) and a central private dictionary
(ispell -p ...) to provide a common private dictionary for an entire
workgroup.  The manager could add items to the private dictionary; other
people could use the private dictionary (^T), but they could not change
it. 


PICO:
To use ispell with pico (the stand-alone editor):
 - implement the 'ispell' program via ^T (CTRL-T) (using the script file) 
   in addition to implementing it via ^_ (CTRL-_) (using pine "S"etup, 
   "C"onfiguration as described above).

Use ^T in pico to use the ispell program and your private dictionary 
(but without the ability to add words to the dictionary).  You cannot 
use ^_ in pico; it is an "Unknown Command".  You can use ^T-ispell in 
pine also, but why bother when ^_ works better.

Content-Description:  Why doesn't "attached-to-ansi" printing work?
Content-Type: MESSAGE/RFC822

Date: Tue, 10 Feb 95 15:40:48 -0800
From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject:  Why doesn't "attached-to-ansi" printing work?

So-called "attached-to-ansi" printing relies on the communication software
you are using to interpret certain special characater sequences that tell
it to divert the incoming stream of characters to your printer, and then
back to your screen.  Perhaps 99% of "pine printing problems" are either
due to PC or Mac communications software that doesn't understand ANSI
escape sequences for printing, *or* (in the dialin case) softare flow-
control problems. 

We didn't understand how big a problem software flow control was 
until 3.90 came out... we changed pine to intercept flow control 
characters so that users would not see Pine "wedge" mysteriously if a 
mis-type or noise generated a control-S, but that did bad things when 
printers, modems, or comm software was depending on s/w flow control.

So in 3.91 we added the "preserve-start-stop-characters" feature, so that
Pine could be configured to respect s/w flow control characters (if the
operating system did) for those folks who needed them.  Enabling this feature
should make Pine 3.91 behave the same way as earlier versions. 

Then we discovered that some operating systems don't enable software flow
control by default.  So in 3.92, the "preserve-start-stop-characters" 
feature will do more than simply "not ignoring" them, it will try to force
the OS to pay attention to them.

So here's the sequence of things to try if you have pine printing 
problems:

 1. CHECK FOR SOFTWARE FLOW-CONTROL PROBLEMS:
    A. Try enabling "preserve-start-stop-characters"  <- requires 3.91
    B. If that doesn't help, verify that the OS is enabling s/w flow
       control; if it isn't, you can either change that in a global 
       .login script, or as a worst case, wrap pine in a script that does 
       it.  By the way, on our AIX systems, we had to execute "stty -ixon"
       followed by "stty ixon" --no one here knows why the first stty
       is needed.  (Note that explicitly enabling s/w flow control in the OS 
       will not be needed in 3.92).
    C. If neither of the above apply, double-check that you actually have
       *some* kind of flow control enabled on your system, either hardware
       or software.
 2. CHECK YOUR COMM SOFTWARE FOR ANSI PRINTING CAPABILITY
    A. After ruling out s/w flow control problems, if printing still 
       doesn't work, the odds are that the PC or Mac comm s/w is at fault.
       I don't know how to determine this other than via trial-and-error
       and word-of-mouth.  
    B. The "ansiprt" utility included in the pine distribution can also 
       be used for testing.  It simply sends the specified text file to 
       user's terminal device, bracketed with the ANSI escape sequences 
       for print diversion.  This is just what Pine does as well (although
       some versions of ansiprt offer a few options not available via Pine.)
 3. POSSIBLE OTHER PRINTING PROBLEMS
    A. Printing via Pine's "attached-to-ansi" facility to a postscript-only
       printer.  Pine does not yet have the ability to encapsulate text
       into postscript, ala "enscript", so the custom print option using 
       enscript and ansiprt will be needed in that case.
    B. Other printer-specific configuration problems.  For example, 
       whether or not the printer needs a trailing formfeed to eject the 
       last page, or a control-D, or non-Unix newline conventions, etc.
       Many of these problem will also require using the custom print 
       command option and "ansiprt".

Content-Description: How do I read News with Pine?

Subject: How do I read News with Pine?


Beginning with version 3.91, it is usually sufficient to set the
nntp-server variable, via the Setup/Config menu. This will automatically 
define a default news-collection.  In case the default is not appropriate 
for your site, the following details may help...

Three ways to access news via Pine: 

    1. Via NNTP. Your .newsrc file must be on the machine where Pine is
       running. Assuming news is stored on the machine news.nowhere.edu,
       a typical .pinerc entry would be: 
       
           news-collections = News *{news.nowhere.edu/nntp}[*]
   
       Note that if the nntp-server variable is set, your
       news-collections will default to NNTP access from that same server.
       

    2. Via IMAP. Your .newsrc file must be on the machine where news is
       stored. Assuming news is stored on the machine news.nowhere.edu, a
       typical .pinerc entry would be: 
       
           news-collections = News *{news.nowhere.edu}[*]


    3. Local News. If news is stored on the same machine you run Pine on,
       you can specify: 
       
           news-collections = News *[*]


The advantage of IMAP newsreading is that the same .newsrc can be used for
both Unix Pine and PC-Pine. The disadvantage is that you must have an
account on the machine that stores the news and runs the NNTP server.

Subject: Why does Pine encode text attachments?


Pine uses MIME's Base64 encoding for *all* attachments, including text, in
order to assure that they are not modified in transit. The goal is make
sure that sending file attachments in Pine is as dependable as using FTP.

Although it may seem like encoding is unnecessary for files that are
plain text, certain email gateway, trasport, and delivery agents pose
a threat to the integrity of even text files (much less binary files).
For example, long lines may be wrapped, trailing spaces deleted, tabs
turned into spaces, lines beginning with "From " modified, etc.
Pmay there are actually several potential sources of corruption

Subject: How can someone without Pine decipher an attachment?

   
Pine uses the MIME Internet standard for attaching files to email messages.
Any MIME-capable mailer should be able to understand Pine's attachments.

If you use Pine's attachment feature, your recipient needs to have either
a MIME-capable mail reader or software that can decode MIME. Fortunately,
these are not hard to find. The major proprietary mail vendors have
committed to MIME support, but some of their upgraded products are some
months away.  One freely-available program which can decipher a MIME
attachment is munpack from Carnegie Mellon. It is available at:

This is easily done by using Pine's "file inclusion" key (Control-R).
Instead of entering the file name on the Attchmnt header line, move
the cursor to the bottom of your messaage, and press Control-R, then
enter the name of the text file.  It will be included at the end of 
your message without any encoding (unless the file contains 8bit or
binary characters, in which case the entire message becomes subject
to MIME encoding rules.)

Subject: Why does Pine use Base64 instead of UUENCODE?


Pine uses the Internet MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)
standard for all attachments.  MIME uses "Base64" encoding rather than
uuencode, because uuencode uses characters that are transformed by some
email gateways, and there are also several incompatible versions of
uuencode.  However, if needed, you can certainly uuencode a file outside
of Pine, then use the Composer's Ctrl-R (file inclusion) command to insert
the uuencoded file into the message.

Keith Moore <moore@cs.utk.edu> has written a Perl conversion script to
convert Mailtool to MIME.  The Perl script and C conversion are
available in

	ftp://cs.utk.edu/pub/MIME/sun-to-mime.perl.Z
	ftp://cs.utk.edu/pub/MIME/sun-to-mime.c.Z

The following is from

        ftp://cs.utk.edu/pub/MIME/sun-to-mime.README

This is a simple filter that takes Sun OpenWindows 3 messages as input,
and produces MIME messages as output.  It's written in perl, so you
need perl installed to run it.

As shipped, the perl program may call uudecode to undo the effects of
uuencoded files, and uuencode to convert binary files to base64 (!).
It calls "zcat" to uncompress files.  Finally, it needs a program
to convert Sun raster files to some other format (like GIF) that
MIME supports.  As supplied, it uses the "convert" program
(part of ImageMagick) to do this, but some other program or set
of programs (like the pbm stuff: "rasttopnm | ppmtogif") will also
work.  Just change the line that calls "convert" to use whatever you
have.

If you are using MH 6.8 or later with MIME support, put this in
your .mhn-profile file (or wherever $MHN points):

mhn-show-x-sun-attachment/: sun-to-mime.perl | mhn -file - -show


If you are using metamail, put this in your .mailcap file:

x-sun-attachment; sun-to-mime.perl < %s | metamail -T ; needsterminal


Enjoy!

Content-Description: "Folder Format Invalidated (consult an expert), aborted"
Content-Type: MESSAGE/RFC822

Date: Tue, 10 Feb 95 15:40:48 -0800
From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: "Folder Format Invalidated (consult an expert), aborted"

                                       

The message "Folder Format Invalidated (consult an expert), aborted" means
that Pine was reading your mail folder, and at the point in which it
expected a start-of-message header line, it found something else. 
   
The ``format invalidated'' condition can happen in one of three ways: 
    1. bad data exists at the beginning of the folder. 
    2. data was appended to the folder after Pine initially read it, and
       the new data did not begin with a start-of-message-header. 
    3. the folder was modified without Pine being aware of it. 
       
All three problems are generally caused by software external to Pine. 
   
Condition (1) can be determined by whether or not the problem repeats
itself after restarting Pine. If restarting Pine does not make the problem
go away, then you need to look at the actual file for the folder and see
what is wrong with the very first line. In particular, make sure that
there are no blank lines at the beginning of the file and that the first
character of the folder file is a capital ``F'' , the second an ``r'', the
third an ``o'', etc.  In the case of an INBOX, you may want to rename the
folder so that new mail can be delivered while repairs on the corrupt
folder are being done. 
   
Condition (2) may be caused by a mail delivery process (e.g. /bin/mail)
which writes some characters other than ``From '' at the beginning of the
new data. 
   
Condition (3) is caused by another program manipulating the mail folder
without following the normal folder locking protocols.  This is a general
problem on UNIX. 
   
Conditions (2) and (3) have also been known to occur when accessing
folders via NFS, if the information returned by the stat() and read()
system calls do not correspond with each other as a result of NFS
attribute caching. 
   
Restarting Pine on that folder always clears conditions (2) and (3). If
the problem is chronic, it may be worth an investigation to determine its
cause. Usually, it is due to the misbehavior of some external software.
The reason why Pine gives up with conditions (2) and (3) is that it does
not want to risk damaging user data by guessing what is right. Pine never
writes to the folder unless it is absolutely sure it knows what it is
doing. 
   
There are some steps which can be taken to reduce the risk of these
conditions coming up. Some of these steps may require the assistance of
your system adminstrator (or whomever it was that built and installed Pine
on your system): 
    1. Use IMAP instead of NFS to access remote folders. Problems with
       locking over NFS are perhaps the single most important cause of
       user difficulties.  Using IMAP eliminates this class of problem.
    2. Consider enabling the mbox driver in Pine. If the mbox driver is
       enabled, mail is transferred from the /usr/spool/mail mail into a
       file called mbox in your home directory, if mbox exists. The home
       directory mbox file is then your INBOX. This has the advantage
       that Pine and the mail delivery system are less often in
       contention for the INBOX, and never both trying to update it.
       Pine only empties the /usr/spool/mail file, it never tries
       updating it. 
    3. Be careful not to run other programs that modify your folders
       while you are running Pine. Such programs may change the folder
       out from under Pine, and lead Pine to conclude that there is a
       problem with its view of the file.

Content-Description: What is folder locking and how does it work?
Content-Type: MESSAGE/RFC822

Date: Tue, 10 Feb 95 15:40:48 -0800
From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is folder locking and how does it work?

                                       

Locks are used by Pine and other mail programs to prevent damage from
occurring to the mail file when multiple programs try to write to the file
at the same time. 
   
Because there are many different schemes of mail file locking used on
UNIX, Pine implements all of them. The result is a lot of complexity. 
   
There are several reasons why locking needs to be done:
   
    1. If you want to read the mail file, you want to make sure that no
       other process will modify the mail file while you are reading it.
       
    2. If you want to write to the mail file, you want to make sure that
       no other process is accessing the mail file while you are writing
       it.
       
    3. If you have the mail file open, you want to make sure that no
       other process can alter any of the internal contents of the mail
       file that you have read, but it is OK if another process appends
       new data to the mail file.
       
    4. If you want to alter any of the internal contents of the mail
       file, you want to make sure that no other process has the mail
       file open.
       
There are several mechanisms of locking:
   
     * The creation of a file which has the same name as the mail file,
       but with a suffix of ".lock" (for example, this lock for
       /usr/spool/mail/isma is named /usr/spool/mail/isma.lock). This
       file accomplishes locks (1) and (2) above. This is an exclusive
       lock. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_SH on the mail file. This
       accomplishes lock (1), and prevents lock (2). Multiple processes
       can do this. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_EX on the mail file. This
       accomplishes lock (2), and prevents lock (1). This is an exclusive
       lock. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_EX on a file on /tmp. The file
       name used depends upon the version of Pine. This accomplishes
       locks (3) and (4). This is an exclusive lock. 
       
On SVR4-based systems, the lockf() subroutine or fcntl() system call it
used instead of flock(). It is rumored that this creates a kind of lock
file as well, but this has not been directly verified. 
   
_NOTE: flock() on BSD systems does not work over NFS, so only the most
basic .lock file locking -- locks (1) and (2) happen over NFS. On SVR4
systems, fcntl() locking attempts to work over NFS, but there are known
problems in the rpc.lockd daemon which have caused hangs if an application
beats on the mechanism too much (and Pine beats on it). All of the above
mechanisms work reliably over IMAP connections._

Subject: What happens when two Pine sessions access the same mailbox at the same time?

                                       

This varies depending on what format your folders are stored in. With the
default Berkeley format, the last session to open a folder will get full
access to the folder and the previous session(s) will be changed to
read-only access. When a folder is read-only, you will not see any further
updates to that folder until it is reopened with full access. Currently
the INBOX cannot be reopened without exiting and restarting Pine. With the
Tenex format, any number of sessions can simultaneously have full access
to a folder, with the exception that expunging is disabled. See "What is a
Tenex mailbox and why should I use it?" for more information.

Subject: Why did I get the message "locked, override in _XXX_ sec"?

                                       

The message "locked, will override in _xxx_ seconds" occurs when Pine has
discovered that some other mail program claims to be accessing your mail
folder (i.e. _folder_.lock exists). This is a very low-level lock used by
programs such as the system mailer in delivering mail, and by certain
programs such as mail, elm, babyl, mm, etc. Supposedly, this lock is only
to be acquired and held for a very short period of time (less than a
second). 
   
It starts with 285 seconds, retries every second, and issues that message
every 15 seconds. The total period of time, 5 minutes, is the time that it
will keep on trying before it concludes that the lock is false -- that is,
that whatever program locked the folder forgot to unlock it (perhaps it
crashed) -- and Pine will go ahead and claim the lock for itself. 
   
This is not due to a conflict between two copies of Pine, since Pine
interlocks against itself in a higher-level fashion. 
   
_NOTE: On some systems with 14 character filename limits, attempting to
open a folder with a 14 character name (e.g. saved-messages) will trigger
this sequence. Folder names should be limited to 9 characters or less on
those systems._

Content-Description: Why doesn't Pine recognize Content-Length header field?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Why doesn't Pine recognize Content-Length header field?


It would be a significant detriment to the performance of the Berkeley
format mailbox parsing code, as well as to Pine's behavior on normal
systems which do not use the Content-Length: header, if any attempt were
made to implement Content-Length:. 

There are many serious technical problems with the Content-Length: 
header, and we do not recommend its use.  Furthermore, we recommend that a
mail delivery agent such as our sendit or tmail tool be used that applies
smart quoting, as opposed to the ordinary BSD /bin/mail quoting of all
lines that begin with "From ".  We have installed such tools on all of our
systems. 

For example, one problem is that a system whose mailer does not implement
Content-Length: will also not enforce its validity should that header
appear. This offers significant potential for mischief.  Another problem
is that Berkeley format mailbox files which use the Content-Length: header
can not be edited with an editor such as emacs or vi without invalidating
the Content-Length: field.  If this problem is not a consideration at your
site, we recommend the use of the tenex format (mail.txt), which is also
length tagged but in a much more efficient fashion. 

>From our perspective, these problems outweigh any possible benefit of
supporting Content-Length: in Berkeley format mailbox files.  At the
present time there are no plans to do so.

designed as a drop-in module, to allow you to replace with alternative
authentication schemes such as AFS, Kerberos, S/Key, etc. 
   
This routine is server_login(). Depending upon which version of c-client
you have, it is either in the os__xxx_.c (where _xxx_ is the name of your
port) or it is in a file named log__yyy_.c which is included by the
os_xxx.c file. 
   
The log__yyy_.c is usually log_std.c (std for "standard UNIX"), but it may
be log_sv4.c (SVR4) or a couple of other variants. This file only contains
that one routine, so it should be a simple matter to modify that file and
rebuild imapd.

Content-Description: Can PC-Pine be used with a POP server?
Content-Type: MESSAGE/RFC822

Date: Tue, 10 Feb 95 15:40:48 -0800
From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Can PC-Pine be used with a POP server?

                                       

No.  Neither Pine nor PC-Pine currently support POP's offline mail model
(wherein pending mail is pulled from the mail server to the local machine
and deleted from the server).  However, it is likely that this model will
be supported, with a choice of either IMAP or POP as the access protocol,
in a future release.

Content-Description: What is a Tenex mailbox and why should I use it?
Content-Type: MESSAGE/RFC822

Date: Tue, 10 Feb 95 15:40:48 -0800
From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is a Tenex mailbox and why should I use it?



Using the Tenex format for INBOXes allows multiple sessions (or mulitple
users, subject to the usual access controls) to have *almost* full
Read-Write access to the INBOX. The only limitation on full RW access is
that if there are multiple sessions at a given moment, no one can do an
Expunge. However, message state changes (e.g. marking a msg as deleted)
*can* be done, and this state is preserved across sessions. 
   
If an explicit Expunge command fails, it will say so and tell you that the
mailbox is in use by another process. When there is only one session left
using that mailbox, expunge will resume working again. 
   
In contrast: the normal Berkeley style folders can have only one RW client
at a time, so _given the current software_ the latest session steals the
RW lock away from any previous session, with the earlier session becoming
RO. 

NOTE:  Mailbox format for INBOX is a function of the mail transfer agent
(sendmail, tmail), not the mail user agent (Pine), so this is a decision
for sys/mail admins, not for regular Pine users.

Content-Description: Where does Pine look for configuration information?
Content-Type: MESSAGE/RFC822

Date: Tue, 10 Feb 95 15:40:48 -0800
From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Where does Pine look for configuration information?

                                     
In Unix and PC Pine 3.90 and higher, the Release Notes (Press "R" on the 
Main Menu) contain a section on Configuration, including default file names 
and environment variables.  Almost all personal configuration can be
accomplished through the Setup (S) command on the main menu. 

Unix Pine uses three configuration files:  a system-wide defaults file, 
a system-wide non-overridable settings file and a personal coniguration file.
If you need to generate a "blank" copy of the system wide configuration
files, run "pine -conf > /usr/local/lib".  If, for some reason, you need to 
generate a blank personal configuration file, run "pine -P pinerc.blank".

Pine does not support some older terminals (e.g. tvi925, WYSE-60) very
well. Some problems can be overcome with a proper termcap entry, but
others, such as handling cursor keys, do not have a good solution.

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: How do I configure Pine to not leave mail in /usr/spool/mail?

You have several options:
   
    1. Leave inbox in /usr/spool/mail, but turn on the Pine option to
       prompt users to move read messages to a folder in their home
       directory upon exiting Pine. 
    2. Modify your mail delivery program to deliver mail directly into
       the user's home directory, and specify that inbox-path in your
       global pine.conf (See the "tmail" program on
       ftp.cac.washington.edu for an example.) 
    3. "touch mail.txt" in each home directory, which will cause Pine
       (upon startup) to pull mail from /usr/spool/mail into ~/mail.txt
       -- however, mail.txt will be a Tenex-format, rather than Berkeley
       mail format folder (faster, but non-standard). 
    4. Link in the "mbox" driver when you build Pine. This driver will
       (upon Pine startup) pull mail from /usr/spool/mail into ~/mbox,
       which will be a Bky-format folder.

The Pine distribution includes binaries for AIX 3.2 (on RS/6000), HP/UX
9.0, Linux 1.1, NeXTStep (on NeXT hardware), SunOS 4.1 (on SPARCStations),
Solaris 2.2, Ultrix 4.1 and 4.2 (on DECStations), MS-DOS (PC-Pine) and
MS-Windows (PC-Pine for Windows). 
   
PC-Pine is available for the following TCP/IP stacks: FTP's PC/TCP,
University of Waterloo's WATTCP stack with packet drivers, Novell's LAN
Workplace, Sun's PC/NFS, and Winsock. 
   
Pine has been compiled on other UNIX platforms (4.3 Berkeley UNIX, DEC
OSF/1 V1.2A, Dynix/PTX V1.4.0, VAX Ultrix 4.1, A/UX 3.0, BSD/386 Gamma
4.1, Convex, Dynix 3.0 and 3.1 on Sequent Symmetry, Interactive Systems

Subject: Pine 3.89 on an IBM RS/6000 running AIX 3.2.3 crashes every time I try to open a folder.

Some AIX distributions apparently include a compiler that does not
correctly compile certain constructs used in Pine 3.89 and earlier. We
think that Pine 3.90 works around the problems but it is difficult for us
to confirm this since there is considerable variation among AIX systems.
We have also not been able to identify a particular version or patch of
AIX or the compiler that is the culprit.

Content-Description: I cannot compile under SCO unix, why not?

From: Gunther Anderson <gunther@ssi.edc.org>
Subject: I cannot compile under SCO unix, why not?


Pine has been tested and compiles just fine on a suitably equipped SCO
Unix 3.2.4, and probably works on the whole 3.2 series (testing has not
been as extensive).  It handles both MMDF and sendmail mailboxes without
needing recompilation.  It should be sufficient just to unpack the source
tree and run "sh build sco" at the top level.  You need to own the
complete Development System, and the Developer's Versions of the other
packages.  Pine will not compile without TCP/IP support. 

The most common problem is when people own the Development System, but
keep getting missing header files (netbd.h is one) in their builds.  This
is a common problem on SCO systems because of the great fragmentation SCO
enjoys in the marketing of system components.  It is easy to get confused
about just what you've bought.  And in this case, haven't bought. What you
need is the "Developer's Version" of the TCP/IP product.  The normal
version just supports the TCP/IP protocol, but doesn't include tools
(including header files) to compile TCP/IP-specific programs.  Alas, the
only remedies available to you are to pick up a pre-compiled version (mine
is on odi.cwc.whecn.edu, ftp.celestial.com has their own, which prefers
Bezerk mailboxes, though it supports MMDF too), or to buy the Developer's
Version of TCP/IP.  If you intend to do any serious compiling of Internet-
available programs, I'd recommend the latter, though many of the most
useful ones are available precompiled on other FTP sites.

Using the built-in Bug Report command (B on the Main Menu or any Help
screen) is useful because it will automatically include configuration
information that may be essential to determining the cause of the problem
you are experiencing.  It also gives you the opportunity to conveniently
include the current message as an attachment in case you believe that 
the problem is specific to that message.

a fix will not apply to the current release.  Hence, if we can't reproduce
the problem in the current version, our standard response will be to ask

Subject: What new features will future releases of Pine include?

The list for 3.92 is not frozen yet.  This release will have a number of
bug fixes, but it will also introduce several new features.  Some of
the things we know will be there include:

 o Fix for some pine.conf variables not working (e.g. local bug address).
 o Delete flag will no longer be preserved on Save.
 o Bky mbox format performance bug fixed.
 o Reply prompt will change if there is a Newsgroups header present.
 o Improvements in software flow-control handling.
 o Improvements in bug report command.
 o Ability to specify an alternative to the sendmail MTA.
 o Support for negotiating 8BITMIME with an ESMTP server.
 o Mouse support for use with X terminals.
 o Pull-down command menus in the Windows version.
 o Feature to disable capture of pipe command output.
 o Ability to use mailcap viewer for attachments of type TEXT.
 o Support for .mime.types file to specify attachment types.

After 3.92 is released, here are a few of the things that we plan to 
work on:

     * Additional MIME support, esp. controlling file TYPING 
     * PEM and/or PGP support 
     * External directory services access 
     * Kerberos support 
     * RFC1522 header encoding for 8bit character sets 
     * Location independence of support files 
     * Offline support 
     * Hierarchy support (awaits IMAP4) 
     * Answered flag not set if reply is postponed (awaits IMAP4) 
     * Faster detection of folders with Recent messages (awaits IMAP4) 
     * Faster fetching of headers (awaits IMAP4) 
     * Determination of which flags are permanent (awaits IMAP4)

When someone (who uses elm) forwards a message to me, pine (3.91, Solaris
2.4) presents the message as two separate messages, rather than a single
message with a forwarded section included. 

Pine's index displays the first message as being from my friend. However
this message is empty. 

The index displays the 2nd message with no "from" address, and with a date
of "xxx -1". Instead of a "from", it just puts a "To: bobb@hsph2" in the
index. 

And, when I read the 2nd message, and turn on rich headers, the only
headers appearing are To: and Subject:. No From or Date headers. 


My question is, who is misbehaving, elm or pine? Is there a workaround for
this situation? 

I've included here the contents of a forwarded message from my friend. 
(I've added the "> " line prefixes)

	Is there really an Amiga version of Pine available?  
If so, then what are the system requirements, and how do I 
go about getting a copy?  Thanks in advance, for any advise!

	Since I am not a system administrator, there is no 
way for me to reboot the Pine program as implemented at my 
site.  Are there any other ways for me to reconfigure Pine, 
so that it is possible for me to insert either reply-to or

most welcome!

I'd agree, if pine had

	- a switch to turn off encoding mails with quoted_printable
	- better command handling. I'm much faster with elm.
	- the feature "alias current message"

But you are generally right. Pine is a nice mailer ...
But elm is a nice mailer, too ;-)

Go to the Main Menu and choose Setup.  Then choose Config.  Go to the 
Customized Headers and Select A to add one of the form
  'Reply-To: mjr@conan.ids.net'.  

This will work for Pine 3.91 but I don't know about earlier versions.

Is there a feature available in Pine which will notify you of the arrival 
of newly received mail while you are working in another program.  i.e. 
something which would pop-up on the screen to tell you that mail has 
arrived so that a user would know that they should stop and check their 
messages.  If Pine does not offer this is there something else that does?

QUICK AND DIRTY WORK-AROUND:
Use your communications software facility for printing (Alt-l <ell> for
ProComm Plus) to dump each screen to the printer.  One disadvantage is that
you get two lines printed twice at each screen break (with some menu text
intermixed).
A double-deep work around would be to save the file to a temporary file,
leave pine, and use the printing facility in combination with "cat" or
some equivalent viewing facility.

P.S. I would like to be able to use the "Y" command as well at home --
or on site for that matter.

I did do that, that's how I was able to get a core dump via running 
pine.  Actually, I had to add an include (<utime.h>) to c-client/os_d-g.h 
to get the thing to compile.  At any rate, the point I'm at is I have 
pine, pico, imapd and mtest all compiled but I'm getting the mentioned 
error. 

any ideas?

It'll work in 3.90 too, but note that Pine 3.90 has some serious
addressbook bugs (you can lose the whole thing) and anyone still using
it should convince their sysadmins to upgrade ASAP...

This is very cool - thanks for telling us about this!

It would be great if the Pine FAQ were also regularly crossposted
to comp.mail.pine,comp.answers,news.answers so that it would get
archived on all the FAQ archive servers like rtfm.mit.edu, etc.
FYI, I have lots of info about FAQ archives at:

  http://www.jazzie.com/ii/internet/faqs.html

Thanks,
Nancy

I'm new to pine and have a question about MIME files.  How do I read a

me, sent as text?  It's an msword doc that I've tried to save and read in

  It's in the Makefile - take out the "-DDEBUG".

I just pulled the latest Pine release for Windows
from www.washington.edu. I'm off to a real good start,
but for some strange reason all of the Mail-folders
that I am able to generate indexes for come up
read-only. So I cannot delete messages, etc.

The mail-folder is local to the PC, I am just trying
to get setup for an off-line reader at this point.

Any clues would be greatly appreciated.

try adding

that will do something like what you are asking for.

To submit a question and answer to the Pine Development Team for
inclusion in the Pine Frequently Asked Questions lists:

- Send it as a message to pine+faq@cac.washington.edu.

- The Subject: line should consist of the question, exactly as it
should appear in the FAQ.

- The body of the message should be the answer, exactly as it should
appear in the text FAQ.

- Comments not part of the question and answer should be sent in a
separate message.  If you do not want to be credited in the FAQ,
please tell us in a separate message so we can remove your name.

- Make the answer as generic as possible.

	+ Avoid references to specific versions of Pine in the
	question and answer.

	+ Avoid terminology, references, directory paths, etc, that
	are specific to one platform, installation or site.

- If possible, references to sources of software, additional
documentation, etc, should be in the form of a URL pointing to the
primary source.

- URLs should be placed on a separate line and indented from the text.

The Pine Team will evaluate the question and answer for accuracy,
clarity, and appropriateness.  Digest, text, and HTML forms of the FAQ
are generated automatically from the message.

Using Linux I am probably spoiled,
but I expect programs to come with .texi manual,
for printing with TeX or viewing with info.

I can't argue with someone who likes nroff.

Dear People:


	Appended below, is my first attempt to insert a "reply-to" 
line as suggested.  I also attempted to insert such a line without 
any sort of quotes, plus with two "`" marks, and with two regular 
quote marks.  All of these efforts were unsuccessful.  Even if I 
had experienced success, such a procedure would not be the best 
for me, because it would not permit me to easily use a "reply-to" 
line only on some of my E-Mail.  Thank you anyway, for trying to 
assist me with this problem.  


Sincerely,

Mike Rollins

1. What can I set in Pine to notify my UNIX shell when mail arrives?
2. How can I find out (from my UNIX shell) if the Pine program is 
   up and running correctly on my system without actually invoking it?

I am running:
tcsh 6.04.00 (Cornell) 93/07/03 (bsd386) options 8b,nls,dl,al

Thanx in advance.

To submit a question and answer to the Pine Development Team for
inclusion in the Pine Frequently Asked Questions lists:

- Send it as a message to pine+faq@cac.washington.edu.

- The Subject: line should consist of the question, exactly as it
should appear in the FAQ.

- The body of the message should be the answer, exactly as it should
appear in the text FAQ.

- Comments not part of the question and answer should be sent in a
separate message.  If you do not want to be credited in the FAQ,
please tell us in a separate message so we can remove your name.

- Make the answer as generic as possible.

	+ Avoid references to specific versions of Pine in the
	question and answer.

	+ Avoid terminology, references, directory paths, etc, that
	are specific to one platform, installation or site.

- If possible, references to sources of software, additional
documentation, etc, should be in the form of a URL pointing to the
primary source.

- URLs should be placed on a separate line and indented from the text.

The Pine Team will evaluate the question and answer for accuracy,
clarity, and appropriateness.  Digest, text, and HTML forms of the FAQ
are generated automatically from the message.

This did not solve my problem.  All it did was cause the error 
'mesg: /dev/tty<whatever> directory not found' when I logged into my 
tcsh.  I don't know if Thom is running in a tcsh or not, so can't 
say definitavely if the 'biff y' trick will work for him.  (Would another 
shell work better?  Say a bash or a ksh?)

How can you set up your account to automatically send a copy of all your
incoming mail to a different account, but not forwarding, I need the
messages to be in both accounts, kinda like automatic bouncing without the
need to issue the bounce command.

1. You can't. But, since you mentioned that you're using tcsh, put the
follwoing in your .tcshrc file:

set    tperiod=3
alias  periodic frm -n

or whatever your prefered "frm" command is. Check out tcsh(1).

2. Use "ps". Try "ps -augx | grep pine" if you're on a BSD'ish
system. Once again, check ps(1).

You should have /usr/lib/aliases which is probably well commented.

	Well....the signature *should* be where you want it.  It is a
configuration option....at least at pine 3.91.  Go the config screens
and find the place you need to check.  You may even find some other
interesting options.

biff y sets your user execute permission to ACTIVE OR 1 on tty
to check your tty status type 

ls -l `tty`

if biff doesn't reside on your system, try setting the user execute
permission manually with

chmod u+x `tty`

to get really COOL (with subject and sender included) notification, 
see if rcvtty is on your system -- if it's available set it up in a 
.forward file -- run a man page on rcvtty for details -- look at the
references at your leisure too; rcvtty require u+x on tty.

you can also use mesg y to get but that allows other intrusions into your
sessions that you might not want -- such as talk and write from group and
public levels

Subject: Having trouble setting the user-domain
Date: 24 Aug 1995 14:56:52 GMT
Message-Id: <41i3vk$7rd@eddie.intr.net>


HI,

I am trying to set the user domain on our host to something
other than our hostname for a particular user. i.e.
the hostname for our box is imi.intr.net, and I have aliased
the box as akos.com  in the sendmail.cf and named.host files.
I have set the user domain variable in the .pinerc to 
akos.com

when this user sends mail from pine, 
the from line contains imi.intr.net, and I want it 
to be akos.com. What else am i missing?? 

I have read thru all the docs i have and I can't
find anything else on this. If I change the user name in the
pinerc, that seems to work, though.

thanks, for any help

biff y or chmod u+x `tty` does not work. I always get something like:
/dev/ttyp1: Not owner

ls -l `tty` results in 
crw-rw-rw-  1 root      20,   1 Aug 24 18:36 /dev/ttyp1

What can I do?

I believe there also exists a program called 'newmail' and its 
counterpart 'wnewmail' (they were on my system [precompiled] when I 
acquired it, so I can't help with any source code)

that way be worth checking into archie.

I believe this can be accompished with the .forward file, where you put 
both the current address and the address you want the copy sent to, in a 
format something like this:

me@someother.address.com
\me@righthere.mymachine.com

but that may not be exactly the right syntax (let me say that if it were 
the right syntax, I'd be surprised) but it is close

in PINE 3.91 can I:

- respond to a message posted to a newsgroup without sending an email 
copy to the author

- choose to respond to the author and the newsgroup, and then when asked 
for confirmation, decide to only send it to the author, and not post it?

if so, please say how.
if I am being unlcear, please let me know

I started on pine, real easy for the beginner.  But as I became more
familiar with unix, I found elm to be more powerful and much more
customizable for individual tastes.   Another thing I like about elm over
pine is that its fast.  Quick in, quick out.  I think this is one of those
arguments thats doomed to a circular existence.  Both programs have an equal
amount of pro's and cons.   Elm seems to be more compatible with other unix
programs which is a big bonus.
Pine offers news reading capabilities, but the programs set up as
newsreader only do a superior job.

I think all you need to do is put this in your .forward

\me@someother.address.com

The backslash means to save a copy at the current address.
Note that on some systems you need to also do:

chmod a+r .forward
chmod a+x $HOME

Good luck,
Nancy

this permission state actually should be sufficient for notification via 
rcvtty -- this looks like a mesg y setting, which simply sets write 
permission active everywhere

have you determined if you have rcvtty? if so, try:

    \widera@fz.telekom.de, "| /usr/local/lib/mh/rcvtty -biff"

in a .forward file at your root level on fz.

all punctuation (\ , ") *IS* significant; you *don't* need biff to work
on your machine for usage of the biff option in this syntax

unfortunately I do not have rcvtty. Is it worth to download it from 
somewhere? In this case: where from ?

How should the permissions on /dev/ttyp1 be set so that biff y is possible?

Hasan,

you have to call the editor explicit with (Oh no, I've forgotten the Shortcut!)
Anyway, it seems to me you want to use vi every time so you can choose Setup from Main Menu, 
goto Config and there you can set the following two features ON:
	enable-alternate-editor-cmd
and	enable-alternate-editor-implicitly

Then every time you move your cursor into the Message Text vi will be called.

Have fun!
 Michael Joswig

   Hello,

Do you know of any plans for a version of Pine to be ported to the Mac? 
It seems odd that it's out there for all of the other major OS's, but
still not for the Mac.

Thanks in advance for the help

  This is for SUN, but try putting 'biff y' in your .login file.
Check if 'biff' exists by reading the man page: 'man biff' or by
typing 'which biff' which will tell you where biff is running from.

  To tell if pine is running type: 'ps | grep pine'
'ps' tells you what processes you have running and 'grep pine'
shows only lines that have 'pine' in them.

and even then it doesn't work correctly if you are trying to share between
a PC and Unix.  Should in next version, though (still using NFS, SMB,

I know nothing about sending encrypted email (not to mention PGP 
encrypted mail). So can someone outline the steps I need to take to
send PGP encrypted email. Maybe sone specific questions will help too:
1. What other software do I need to run besides the elm and pine we
run on the unix machine
2. What is the PGP public key ? How and where to put in with the mail ?
3. What versions of elm or pine must I use ?

I believe rcvtty to be a standard part of the standard UNIX mail handling

where to find it -- but my best guess is that it is likely on your system
somewhere or at least reasonably easy to get -- contact your local admin,

everything! %+) 

O'Reilly & Associates has a text out "MH & xmh" that is *reilly* good (if 
they steal that this documents that I'm due a royalty) ISBN 1-56592-027-9
it really is the bible on MH and xmh (the X Windows front end to MH)

I am trying to answer this on page
	http://www.math.fu-berlin.de/~guckes/elm/elm.pgp.html

It's still just a draft, so I welcome all hints for more info.
I have stored some URLs about PGP somewhere which I will add RSN.

Well, "pgp" for one thing.
For now, please take a look at alt.security.pgp and the FAQs therein.

>2. What is the PGP public key ? How and where to put in with the mail ?

PGP is a "public key crypto system", meaning that you can publish your
"public key" (a data set) for others to encrypt mail for you which you will
be able to read (decrypt) with your "secret key".

>3. What versions of elm or pine must I use ?  

If you just use the PGP scripts (morepgp, mailpgp) then any version of ELM
will do.  However, you need "perl" as they were written in perl.

There is a set of patches for ELM2.4PL24 written by Michael Elkins which
add PGP support to ELM.  More info on that from the above mentiones page.
There are links to Michael's www pages, too.

First recommendation, buy the book _PGP: Pretty Good Privacy_ by Simson
Garfinkel, published by O'Reilly.  I would find it hard to believe
that it is not available in Hong Kong, at least at some of the bigger
bookstores or at the college book store.  Phil Zimmerman also has a
book out published by MIT Press, but I can't remember the title.  The
Garfinkel book is pretty much the standard text on PGP.  

>Maybe sone specific questions will help too:
>1. What other software do I need to run besides the elm and pine we
>run on the unix machine
Obviously, PGP, and an editor.  There is a version of elm that
combines an interface to PGP with it.  When you are ready to send a
message, in addition to the usual choices of send, edit, and forget
it, you are also given a choice pgp.  If you choose pgp, you can
encrypt, sign, or both.  The encrypt has a problem in that if the
address does not exactly match the key owner, it can't find the key.
For example, my key is owned by billr@tsc.com.  If you had this key in
your public ring, and tried to encrypt a reply to this message, the
mailer wouldn't find it, since our mailer attaches the machine name to
the from line, and my address is billr@elmer.tsc.com.  But for the
most part the elm/PGP combo is handy.  Also useful if you use emacs is
mailcrypt.  With mailcrypt, you can encrypt your files (messages) from within
emacs. But all you really need is a mail program, editor, and pgp.

>2.  What is the PGP public key ?  How and where to put in with the mail ?
The public key is the key is the key that you let anyone have to send you
messages.  There is no attempt to keep it secret.  Here is my key:
- -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: 2.6.2

mQBtAy9t1tgAAAEDALtPwQ7n5gHHiZkpPzUPwXiYz2LLpvirqvFC8iiiE3xG6Wk6

8Q6ga+mLT9tWsA2pWQAFEbQcQmlsbCBSb2JlcnRzIDxiaWxsckB0c2MuY29tPg==
=Glx4
- -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

You can use the above key to verify my signature to this message,
check my fingerprint, or send me an encrypted message.  The issue of
whether I am really the Bill Roberts who works at TSC, or an imposter
stealing his mail is another issue entirely.  (I am, I swear it).

>3. What versions of elm or pine must I use ?  
Any version that works for you.  I would recommend that when you
encrypt something, though, you use "ASCII armor" and set text mode.
Some mailers (maybe one along the path of your message) don't like
non-ASCII characters in messages.  text mode provides protection for
different text files.

Best bet, get the book and read it.  Then try using PGP to send and
receive both plain text, signed messages (like this one) or encrypted
messages.  

Hope this helps.

I don't use pine myself, haven't done more than browse through
the man page.  I'm a sysadmin on a public access system where it's
installed.  One of our users has a 17meg mail file (he likes mailing
lists), and I've noticed that when he fires up pine he gets a ~25meg
process, we run out of memory and start swapping, and system performance
goes to hell.

Is pine really reading the whole mail file into memory?  Is there
a way to configure it to not do this?

  I think it should be on ftp.utia.cas.cz in /pub/unix/unix-binary/... (I

When using the default Berkeley (bezerk) mailbox format, Pine does
indeed read the entire folder into memory.  This can be avoided by
switching to a format, such as Tenex, that only keeps an index in
memory.  See the Pine Technical Notes for more information.  They can
be found in the doc directory of the source distribution or at

would you please tell me how to crosspost to more than, say, four

(I tried the "control R" command and pasting in my (6 or 8 newsgroups groups 
long list) under newsgroups, to no avail....)

I sometimes need to post the same item to more than three or four groups -
I can already post to three or so with no problem, but even when I use
"control R" I can't manage to post to more than three newsgroups. What's
the PINE "crosspost to" command? If it's totally impossible in PINE, can I
use TIN to accomplish the samne goal of posting the same post to, say, six
or eight groups at once? 

Thanks for your help!

To elaborate on David's answer, in the standard Unix mailbox format (what
the Pine source code calls "bezerk" for hysterical reasons), various
overhead data (such as message status flags, unique identifiers, etc.) are
stored in additional header lines in the header of the message.  These are
variable-width fields, and aren't present at all when a message is
initially delivered.

In order to update this data, there is a Scylla vs. Charybdis decision:
	Scylla: copy the mail file to a scratch file, then copy back
		with the update
	Charybdis: read the mail file into an in-memory snapshot, then
		dump out updates as necessary
The reason why you can't just overwrite is that messages may grow when
their status changes.

Many mailers choose to fall into the clutches of 6-headed Sylla.  Well,
here at UW we have disk quotas and users who are regularly at the edge of
their quota, so Pine chose the whirlpool of Charybdis instead.  This works
well with ordinary student users, but as you noted it does fall apart with
a 17-megabyte godzilla mailbox.

The Tenex format mentioned by David uses pre-allocated fixed-width fields,
so editing in place with random-access update-mode I/O can work.  Thus, it
only needs to keep an index in memory.  However, even this has hazards;
update mode I/O doesn't work well over NFS.  However, if you use IMAP for
remote access and avoid NFS, you don't have this problem; and Tenex format
does work very well with large mail files.

Apologies to those who are not up on Greek mythology.

Dear Mr. Miller:


	Great!  Your suggestion seems to work!  Please send me 
a reply via my World account - it will be autoforwarded to this 
one - in order to test this.  Thanks!  

	BTW, is there also a way for me to add in a followup 
line on the same "Customized Headers =" line?  If so, then 
please do let me know how.  Thanks again!


Sincerely,

Mike Rollins

Under Linux, I use a program called popmail to get my mail from my ISP
via POP3 and put it into a file on my local system. Then I use PINE to
get and read it from there.

I am sure it is available for other unixes. Maybe this is what you
need.

Is there a way I can edit *within Pine* an existing email received?  I
subscribe to various listerv digests and upon reading, I would like to
be able to edit out from the digest that which I don't want to keep.
I've tried various approaches, all seem a workaround or kludgy rather
than a direct command to call up an editor within Pine
on the existing email.  Suggestions?

Bob

When using pine, I type E to export files, then I download them. Now, how 
do I delete the files that have been exported?

Go back to the PINE folder (inbox or sent-mail or saved-messages or
whatevever) and (D)elete them.  (E)xporting does not delete the mail
message from pine, it copies it to your home directory on your server. 
Now when you say yer' downloading them I assume you're on a pc dialed into
a unix server, and the download puts it on your pc's harddrive ???  If so,
you have one further step ... delete the Exported file from your home (or
mail?) directory on your unix server. 

ReReading this, I realise it's probably confusing, so post a (f)ollowup 
or feel free to e-mail me if you need more help.  I do DOS & Windowzzz, 
but apples are kinda fruity.  Really, it's not that difficult but ya 
gotta be more specific about your hardware, software, connection, etc.

hello !
 we use nfs mounted mailboxes and procmail as teh local delivery agent. I 
read that to enable lossless mail handling, MTA and MUA should have same 
locking (at least one) mechanism. My procmail is set to only dot locking. 
How do I do same for pine ?? my system is a DGUX

Thankyou

Yes

You may have to add #include <utime.h> to the os-d-g.c file

Greetings,

Pine on my linux system is giving me the error upon start-up that it 
can't write /home/username/.pinerc: no space on device.  I have not 
quotas enabled, and can write to the drive just fine (actually, pine is 
dumping a pinerc23809 file in my directory everytime I run pine).  It just 
started doing this; the only change I've made to the system is that I 
reconfigured sendmail.

Any idea what's up?
Thanks,
David Lippman, mzeip@cc.wwu.edu, iscs@az.com

Help!

Everytime I hit a wrong command key in Pine 3.91 it
freezes up and is impossible to get out of! 
Something in my config needs changed. 
Any help is greatly appreciated,  Thanks.

  It happens to me sometimes that 3.91 freezes...when I try to delete
  from an external folder and get a "cannot access". I don't know if
  it is the fault of Pine or my provider?

I've checked the FM, but I can't find a reverence to "alias current message".
What command invokes this feature and what does it accomplish?
Why would someone want to alias a message?  What does it mean to
alias a message?

I've tried installing Pine using the sv4 makefile but get an error.
The error states an incompatible declaration for gethostid in
c-client/osdep.h line 84.  This line delcares: long gethostid().  I can't
find where this would be a problem.  Can anyone provide a working
makefile or at least pointers on where to go from here?  PICO seemed to
compile fine but I have not used it yet.  Thanks.

What does mailtool do now since the content-length will have changed? Is
there any effect at all?

statements. CDS will respond to both comments made about CDS and comments
made about Worldtalk where applicable. It is our business practice not to
degrade another vendor's solution, but point out the advantages of CDS's
solution. Independent reviews of CDS's Messaging Solution indicate CDS
leads the industry with high quality, standards-based technology and
implementations.

DISCUSSION:
-----------

On Monday, August 11, 1995 we received a fax from a potential Control Data
client comparing Mail*Hub and Worldtalk. This comparison was originally
generated by Worldtalk Corporation and given to the client during a
competitive bid process. What follows in the first subsection is a verbatim
copy of that comparison. In the second subsection, Control Data responds to
the comparison.

Worldtalk's Comparison
----------------------

                CONTROL DATA SYSTEMS AND WORLDTALK COMPARISON

Product vs. Services:
     CDS: Mostly services. CDS services are required for an extended length of
          time.
      WT: Mostly product.

X.400 Standard:
     CDS: ISODE, not very flexible
          o Limited routing capabilities
          o Slow
      WT: HP X.400
          o Commercial implementation
          o Native Stack (OSI and RFC1006 over TCP/IP)

X.500:
     CDS: QUIPU
          o Lack of 93 support
          o Non Commercial implementation
          o Weak on security
          o Non scalable (Database is loaded in memory)
      WT: ICL with Worldtalk Extensions
          o Commercial Implementation
          o Scalable (Multi Database support)
          o Strong on Security and Access Control
          o 1993 Support

Customization Requirements:
     CDS: Heavy, results in unavoidable dependence on CDS services
      WT: Light


ELECTRONIC MAIL GATEWAYS

Addressing:
     CDS: CDS's gateways do not provide full transparency to the end user.
          Addressing is not native. User will notice a difference in addressing
          when sending mail to recipients behind the Mail*Hub switch. The

          address reflects the address form necessary on the recipient's mail
          system.
      WT: Worldtalk's Address Manager and Directory Synchronization guarantee
          full address transparency to end users. Users only see aliases which
          conforms to both the addressing format of their native mail systems
          and the naming standard for their implementation. The presence of
          Worldtalk is hidden from end users.

Address Resolution:
     CDS: CDS gateways use X.500 directly to resolve LAN Addressing to X.400 or
          SMTP. LAN addressing is not Hierarchical and resolving these addresses
          requires a slow operation, a Yellow Page search with base object root
          in X.500.
      WT: Worldtalk uses a Cache Directory exported from X.500 and indexed on
          X.400 O/R Names and LAN Addresses. This guarantees fast response times
          for address resolution.

Attachments:
     CDS: Attachment [sic] are not always fully preserved.
      WT: Worldtalk preserves all attachments and preserves names and
          attributes.

FTAM Body Part:
     CDS: Does not support. Any File Attribute Preservation is proprietary and
          therefore is NOT interoperable with other X.400 implementations.
      WT: Fully supported. File Attribute Preservation is end-tend with other
          systems that support the FTAM Body Part. In addition, Worldtalk can
          downgrade Body Part 15 attachments to Body Part 14, enabling users
          connected to a 1984 based MTA to receive attachments even if they were
          originally encoded in Body Part 15

Throughput:
     CDS: End-to-end CDS is 40% slower.
      WT: Benchmarks at greater than 5,000 messages per hour.

Gateway Technology:
     CDS: Utilizes technology from a variety of sources
      WT: Tightly and uniformly integrated technology from one source.


DIRECTORY SYNCHRONIZATION

Productization:
     CDS: Directory Synchronization is not fully productized. Makes extensive
          use of shell scripts. Significant customization is REQUIRED after the
          installation of Directory Synchronization gateways.
      WT: Robust, fully productized with default configuration for ease of
          installation and implementation.

Management:
     CDS: Difficult as it requires manually editing shell scripts and
          configuration files.
      WT: Worldtalk Directory Synchronization is managed entirely from one
          central management utility.

Profile Mapping Rules:
     CDS: Directory Synchronization mapping rules are not flexible and require
          significant customization.
      WT: Worldtalk provides very flexible mapping rules that are fully
          productized.

Scheduling:
     CDS: Directory Synchronization relies on UNIX scheduling (Cron).
      WT: Directory Synchronization fully integrated into product.

Directory Filter
     CDS: Limited, provided via shell scripts.
      WT: Import and Export filtering, configurable individually for each
          Directory Synchronization Unit. Complete control of flow of
          information.

Reporting:
     CDS: Limited, provided via shell scripts.
      WT: Report creates report every time synchronization is run.

Full and incremental synchronization:
     CDS: Full synchronization only. Incremental synchronization is not
          supported from Mail*Hub to mail systems.
      WT: Worldtalk provides full synchronization, incremental synchronization,
          and resynchronization.

Transaction Log:
     CDS: None
      WT: Fully supported

Naming Conventions:
     CDS: Limited
      WT: Fully flexible due to strong Address Management

cc:Mail:
     CDS: All users behind Mail*Hub appear all in the same location. This means
          that the locality of the recipient is not preserved.
      WT: Worldtalk supports the registration of Downstream Post Offices as
          native cc:Mail Post Offices. All other mail system Post Offices appear
          as native cc:Mail post offices to all cc:Mail users.

Lotus Notes:
     CDS: CDS only supports a single Name and Address Book.
      WT: Worldtalk supports alternate Name and Address Books, including the
          creation of new Name and Address Books for users behind the Worldtalk
          Switch.

QuickMail:
     CDS: Does not support QuickMail Directory Synchronization.
      WT: QuickMail Directory Synchronization fully supported.

Microsoft Mail for PC Networks:
     CDS: Synchronizes with standard template only.
      WT: Synchronizes standard and customized templates.


X.500 OPEN DIRECTORY SERVICES

Underlying Database:
     CDS: The CDS X.500 database is currently loaded to Memory. There is no
          support for a commercial database or a relational database. This means
          that the product is not scalable and is not reliable. Processes can't
          share the database.
      WT: Worldtalk provides a relational database under X.500 and works with
          SQL based commercial databases as well.

1993 Shadowing:
     CDS: CDS does not support shadowing based on the 1993 DISP standard.
          Support is not scheduled till [sic] the second Quarter of 1996.
      WT: Worldtalk fully supports 1993 shadowing and replication based on the
          DISP standard. Interoperability has been conducted with the only other
          vendor that fully supports DISP (Nexor)

X.509: Security and Authentication:
     CDS: Does not support
      WT: Fully supported

DSA Scalability:
     CDS: Limited due to the fact that DSA is stored in memory, 50,000 practical
          limit.
      WT: The DSA has been used with around 200,000 entries, and shows no signs
          of limitation.

Performance:
     CDS: Slow
      WT: Worldtalk's DSA is orders of magnitude faster than CDS on the same
          platform for the same operations and size of the database.

Attribute search on same machine and database size:
     CDS: 4.8 seconds
      WT: 0.7 seconds

Schema:
     CDS: Altered to add aliases for address resolution. The aliases are
          relevant to local mail servers and have no importance at the
          global level.
      WT: Default provided, user customizable.

Administration:
     CDS: Edit files (Local management)
      WT: Windows Management Tool (Local and Remote Management)

Control Data's Response
-----------------------

GENERAL

Product vs. Services:
        Control Data is a solutions provider. We offer the software,
Mail*Hub; the hardware, Sun SPARC, HP 9000, IBM RS/6000, Sun on Intel, and
Windows NT (future), and finally we offer the services and support.
Worldtalk recently has attempted to portray themselves as integrators
rather than gateway sellers in public relations material.

X.400 Standard:
        Mail*Hub's X.400 is not ISODE based. It is an in-house developed
technology that is fully 1992 revision compliant and offers performance in
the tens of thousands of messages per hour. Mail*Hub also supports OSI over
TCP/IP as dictated by RFC1006. In addition to compliance with these
standards, our X.400 is compliant with RFC1801 which defines how X.400
should utilize X.500 for routing services. To the best of our knowledge,
Worldtalk's X.400 backbone is only a 1988 revision and offers no RFC1801
compliance.

X.500:
        Although Mail*Hub's X.500 was originally derived from ISODE QUIPU,
it has been almost totally rewritten into a commercial product. The 1993
revision product is being developed entirely in-house. 1993 extensions are
currently implemented in Mail*Hub v3.0 to be released in 4Q95. The X.500
directory is memory based and very fast and scalable. The University of
Minnesota DSA has been at 150,000+ entries for over 3 years and the CGDS
DSA is running with 250,000 entries. CDS has over 2.5M total users with
that number growing every day. Worldtalk's X.500 product just began
shipping recently. CDS's X.500 product has been market-proven for over four
years.

Customization Requirements:
        The beauty of Control Data's solution is our ability to customize.
Mail*Hub is offered in a default configuration. From there, the client
dictates what level of customization needs to be performed. This
customization may be done by the client, by a third-party, or by Control
Data's systems-integrators.


E-MAIL GATEWAYS


Addressing:
        Control Data's addressing is completely transparent. Mail*Hub
utilizes X.400 preferred O/R names to map LAN-specific and non-unique
addresses to enterprise wide LAN-style addresses.  For example, to a MS
Mail user all recipients look like MS Mail-style addresses, and to a SMTP
user all recipients look like RFC821-style addresses.

Address Resolution:
        Although CDS's LAN addressing scheme is not hierarchical, by
storing LAN addresses as X.500 aliases and utilizing several levels of
information caching, search times in the sub-second range have been
attained.  Searches do not have to occur at the base object root in X.500.

Attachments:
        CDS fully supports binary attachments. The Document Conversion
Manager (DCM) converts between X.400 attachments and MIME, audio formats,
image formats, between character sets, downgrades X.400 from '92 to '88 to
'84, and it converts among MacOS and DOS/Windows file formats via KEYpak
translators. These translations are completely transparent to the user. In
addition the DCM allows users to specify preferred conversion formats,
therefore the recipient of the attachment is not bound to the format of the
sender.  In all cases, CDS high-speed gateways do preserve attachments
between email systems.

FTAM Body Part:
        X.400 FTAM Body Parts will be fully supported with Mail*Hub v3.0 in
4Q95. Compatibility with '88 and '84 X.400 sites will be maintained by
automatic downgrades via integration with the DCM

Throughput:
        Worldtalk's comment that CDS is "40% slower" is given without any
benchmark specifications. Mail*Hub production installations have exhibited
throughput of 20,000 messages per hour or greater.  Benchmark environments
have shown several times that performance.

Gateway Technology:
        All Control Data gateways are designed in-house with the exception
of our QuickMail gateway (Mail*Link from StarNine) and the SNADS engine
from Linkage.  The QuickMail gateway is being replaced with a CDS Gateway
in 4Q95.  Worldtalk offers no in-house support for IBM PROFS or SNADS or
DEC's ALL-IN-1. These gateway's are only available from third-party
vendors.


DIRECTORY SYNCHRONIZATION

Productization:
        The Mail*Hub suite is a professional, commercial product available
in a default configuration. All aspects of Mail*Hub may be customized as
dictated by the customer. This allows ease of integration with the
customer's existing systems. This feature positively differentiates
Mail*Hub from other products in its class.  The use of PERL scripts allows
customers to easily implement their own customizations if they so choose.

Management:
        CDS offers a very robust set of management features. First, the
Advanced Operations Manager (AOM) provides a central, GUI-based interface
for the administration of the entire Mail*Hub suite. Directory
synchronization procedures can be performed within AOM. Second, a majority
of all configuration information is stored within the X.500 directory. Also
of mention is Mail*Hub's interoperability with SNMP, HP OpenView, SunNet
Manager and MADMAN-MIB. Again, scripts and configuration files are an
integral part of the customization process.  Intelligent defaults often
make customization of these files unnecessary.

Profile Mapping Rules:
        The highly customizable nature of CDS's directory synchronization
greatly enhances flexibility. Nearly any field in a third-party mailer can
be mapped to Mail*Hub.

Reporting:
        Mail*Hub unquestionably supports reporting of directory
synchronization events and errors.

Full and incremental synchronization:
        Both full and incremental synchronization are supported between
Mail*Hub and its supported mail systems. Worldtalk's use of the term
"resynchronization" is arbitrary and is meaningless without a context.

Transaction Log:
        Mail*Hub unquestionably supports transaction logs.  We are running
a number of managed services for large customers that produce very large
transaction logs.

Naming Conventions:
        Mail*Hub supports whatever naming conventions the customer deems
necessary. Because LAN names and other mail aliases are stored in the X.500
directory, it is a simple matter to add or change an address name.

cc:Mail:
        Worldtalk supports a more hierarchical LAN addressing scheme,
however Mail*Hub's implementation has proven to be very efficient and
equally capable.  Mail*Hub has been used successfully in very large cc:Mail
environments such as Unilever's 30,000+ users.

Lotus Notes:
        Mail*Hub can add and update users in a single pre-existing Name and
Address book. In addition, Mail*Hub can export to multiple Name and Address
books.  It is true that Mail*Hub does not currently support the creation of
new Name and Address Books.

QuickMail:
        Mail*Hub fully supports QuickMail directory synchronization.

Microsoft Mail for PC Networks:
        Mail*Hub fully supports standard and customized synchronization
templates.


X.500 OPEN DIRECTORY SERVICES


Underlying Database:
        Mail*Hub's memory-based directory structure is reliable, scalable,
and performance oriented. Production environments such as the University of
Minnesota (150,000+ entries for 3+ years), Unilever with 50,000 entries and
growing to 300,000 and a CGDS DSA with 250,000 entries prove that
Mail*Hub's directory is reliable and scales well. The directory is also
fully distributed, so multiple DSAs can share directory information.

1993 Shadowing:
        Mail*Hub supports Quipu-based shadowing in the current 1988
version. 1993 DISP support will be included in Mail*Hub v3.0 to be released
4Q95.

X.509 Security and Authentication:
        Mail*Hub supports Quipu-based access controls in the current 1988
revision and 1993 standards-based support will be included in Mail*Hub
v3.0. Mail*Hub currently supports and will continue to support X.509
certifications and authentication.

DSA Scalability:
        A Mail*Hub production environment is currently running 200,000+
entries.

Performance and Attribute search on same machine and database size:
        Worldtalk characterizes the Mail*Hub DSA as "slow" and claims their
DSA is "orders of magnitude faster than CDS". However, their numbers
support a difference of only 6.6x. In actuality, the Mail*Hub DSA supports
15-25 search operations per second, making Worldtalk 10.5x to 17.5x slower
than Mail*Hub with respect to their stated time.

Schema:
        Schema addition is a supported feature of X.500. By adding and
storing address and routing information in the directory structure, Control
Data is utilizing the directory to its fullest extent.

Administration:
        Nearly 100% of all configuration information is maintained within
the X.500 directory structure. The distributed nature of the directory
allows for both centralized and/or distributed configuration and
management. Management is available through a powerful, GUI-based Advanced
Operations Manager. Directory tools such as osilookup, aXess500, and
xlookup are all GUI-based. In addition, interoperability exists with SNMP
and the HP OpenView management system.

CONCLUSION:
-----------

None of the accusations that have been made by Worldtalk are grounded in
hard facts. Their comments on our support for Lotus' cc:Mail and Notes are
the only items with even a thread of truth. Many of the accusations that
have been made here appear to be due to competitive pressures Worldtalk has
been experiencing with the CDS Messaging Solution. Again, our business
practice is to point out CDS advantages and let independent analysts
compare, in a non-competitive fashion, technology and delivery solutions
between companies.

Hi !

Can anyone mail me the ftp-path to a unix-source for a decoder that decodes
the base64-format ? doesn't need to be a complete program, just a code, that
I can compiler under Linux. A DOS executable would also be good.

Please mail me, because I'm not sure if this thread belongs in this

Thanx in advance.

    If you are using Pine 3.91, from the Main Menu go into Setup and 
Configuration.  Scroll down several screens to sort-key.  There are various 
options there for how things are sorted when you see them.  Experiment 
with some of those.  OrderedSubject might give things by thread order.  
(The help screens should say.)

Well, it actually means
"create an alias of the return address of the current mail".

This is bound to "a a".
The first "a" goes to the "Alias Menu", the second aliases the (return
address of the) curent mail.

This is described on the "ELM Alias FAQ" page:

	When I can cancel it reports something like:
	Can't open mail; too many open files

	I saved my .mailbox and at the prompt hit:
	Mail (with the cap M)

	It seemed to read that days E-mail, scrolling up. At the end I 
exited. Still it didn't work.
	I then saved my .pinerc, deleted .pinerc and reloaded .pinerc 
(making sure its ".pinerc" not _pinerc).

	Still the same.
	Using Elm it shows, also, just the days E-mail, not the 344 odd 
"lost". Trying to send in Elm doesn't produced at "sent mail" report and 
afterwards I don't get the proper flag it was sent, just an blank.
	CRL has tried to help but now seem stuck.
	HELP!

I never heard back on this.  Does anyone know how or if this keyword is 
supposed to work?  I thought it was supposed to govern how long those 
messages are displayed on the bottom of the screen.  You know the 
messages I'm talking about, the messages that tell you what you already 
know but it still gives you PLENTY of time to read???  (Just funnin')

Really, I'd like to know where to put this in the .pinerc to make it 
work.  I have added it to .pinerc but pine seems to wish it into the 
cornfield.

Thanks.

I'm new to pine and realize that an attached mimed doc can be saved and read using word, etc.  But I have an email that sent a word doc as part of text, not attached.  Therefore, part of the email msg is the mimed word doc.  I've tried to save it and read it in word but that doesn't work.  Is there any way I can extract it to view the doc?  I've even tried to send it to myself as an attached doc but it attaches it as text, not as an application/file.

thanks!

I believe you are referring to a _source_ change someone suggested,
not a .pinerc configuration change...

OrderedSubj is what I use, and I consider that proper threading.

It still prompts me on whether I want to _really_ post or not, so I'm 
still looking for help on that one.

Hi !

Can anyone mail me the ftp-path to a unix-source for a decoder that decodes
the base64-format ? doesn't need to be a complete program, just a code, that
I can compiler under Linux. A DOS executable would also be good.

Please mail me, because I'm not sure if this thread belongs in this
newsgroup. (Dunno a better one)

Thanx in advance.

Does anyone know if there are any other IMAP mail clients in existance, or at 
least in development?

Any info would be great

I just jumped into this newsgroup, so if a FAQ exists for this question,
please let me know.

I have set up pine for one of our users. Everything works. When she
attaches binary files, they get MIME'd. The typical recipients don't
have MIME or pine, but are on a Unix (Linux) system. Is there a command
line program which decodes MIME files like uuencode/uudecode? I haven't
been able to locate anything in the man pages or searching for mime*
commands.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Please email response even if you
post a reply.

Thanks - Mark Foley

    To do this in Pine (at least, what I think you are wanting), press T 
when viewing a message to "T"ake the address into the addressbook.  Pine 
will prompt you for the nickname you want to use and will give you the 
opportunity (if you want) to modify the fullname and the email address.

The ATISMAIL is up to:

ftp://oak.oakland.edu/SimTel/win3/winsock/atisml04.zip

not 03

If anyone wants to make the change.

I recall running across a package that would allow the reading, writing and
updating of a POPmail mailbox through a HTML interface. Is this package
publically available anywhere?

It seems that it would be fairly trivial to implement a program that would
accept HTTP requests with authorization (username/password), use them to
connect to a POPMail server, and return the results.

Proper handling of MIME messages would be a plus.

We are using NCSA Telnet 2.6 for the Mac to login to sunos and solaris
servers to access pine.  When Cntl-^ is pressed, the number 6 appears on
the screen, we don't get the "Mark Text" message.  When I access pine
through rlogin on a Sun workstaion the Cntl-^ key sequence works great. 

Does anyone know how to get the Cntl-^ key sequence to be recognized as 
Mark Text by pine?  or should I be sending this message to NCSA?

Thank you for your time.

I just grabbed the FAQ and this probably answered in it, but, on the off 
chance it isn't....

Can I put a line in my mail so that I get a note back saying the recipent 
has gotten the mail or opened the mail?

Thanks

How can I configure PINE to prompt me when I start it up to enter a user 
name?  (my sister uses my account occasionally, and its a bit of a pain 
editing .pinerc all the time)  I am sure this is possible, since a friend 
of mine had this set up in PINE.  He has since lost the account, and he 
never did give me the copy of his .pinerc file I requested.  He has no 
clue how it was set up either (I was like that when he got it, and was 
never the type to figure out how things work.)

In any case, I'd appreciate any help with this.  Thanks.

I'd like to know if Pine can be used to read Usenet newsgroups and if so, 
how do I configure it?
 
Also, I am a blind user, using a text-to-speech conversion package.  Pine 
seems to haul the system cursor around the screen after each Pine 
command.  This causes my screen access software to read the screen to me 
over and over.  Is there a way to configure Pine so that it is more 
interactive with the system cursor as it really exists?  For instance, if 
I am in the index feature, and I D msg 4, I will hear that I have deleted 
msg 4 before I her that I am on msg 5.  If I am quoting a msg in a reply, 
I will hear, as I type my new reply, the quoted parts over and over.  If 
I cursor down through the screen to edit, I will have to hit my next line 
<cursor down> then my key whhich reads my current line because the Pine 
cursor and the system cursor seem to meld at this point and my speech 
*thinks* we are on the previous line.  It has been explained to me by my 
sys op that Pine grabs the keyboard and treats the machine of the user 
like a dumb terminal.  My terminal has to stay smart@!! <g> got any ideas?
 
 Thanks!!

I think you'll find that Pine 3.91 already can do what you want through 
its normal Setup Configuration screen.

In particular the variable "customized-hdrs" can be used to add custom 
heeaders such as "X-Organization:" along with, if you wish, a default 
value for each.  However in order to see these headers or change their 
value you must use the Ctrl/R (Rich Header) command when composing your 
message.

However there is also a variable called "default-composer-hdrs".  This 
lists the headers you wish to be shown by default when composing a 
message (ie, the "normal" ones you see without having to type Ctrl/R).  
You can quite happily set up a list here to specify the headers you want 
shown as standard.  Note that this list *overrides* the standard set, so 
if you want them to appear you must include them in your list.  See the 
on-line help for this variable for details.

There are four very useful variables that can only be set in the 
systemwide "fixed" configuration file:

disable-config-screen	Prevents access to the configuration screen.
disable-password-cmd	Prevents people changing their password.
disable-update-cmd	Disables the "Update" command (useful for UNIX systems)
disable-kblock-cmd	Disables the "keyboard lock" feature of Pine.

You may want to try some/all of them.

Thr problem lies not with Pine, but with the configuration of your Mac 
and NCSA Telnet.  If I recall correctly you will probably find a "fixed 
controls" ("fc") keyboard file included with NCSA Telnet.  If you install 
this in your System file and select it using the "Keyboard" control panel 
you will then be able to type the more obscure control sequences properly.

Having done this you will find that Ctrl/Shift/6 generates the required 
Ctrl/^ just fine.  (^ is Shift/6)

I realise this question is not (yet) directly relevant to Pine (Mailcap 
and/or mime.types support coming in a future release?), but in the hope 
that someone can help...

>From various packages in the past I understood the format of entries in a 
mime.types file to look something like this:

application/postscript		.ai .ps .eps

However we have justed installed WebForce (Netscape, WebMagic, etc) on 
our SGI systems and I have found that the mime.types file it installed 
looks like this:

#--Netscape Communications Corporation MIME Information
# Do not delete the above line. It is used to identify the file type.

type=application/octet-stream  exts=bin,exe       icon=binary.xbm
type=application/oda           exts=oda
type=application/pdf           exts=pdf
type=application/postscript    exts=ai,eps,ps     icon=text.xbm
type=application/rtf           exts=rtf

Is the former simply a cut down version of the latter?  Is the latter a 
newer/more fully specified version of the former?  Do programs other an 
Netscape understand both formats?  Does Netscape 1.1S understand the 
former?  What about the forthocoming Pine?

Basically, which should I be using? -- They look so different!

Thanks for any advice you can give!

I don't understand that statement.  Why post before checing the faq you
have in front of you?

>Can I put a line in my mail so that I get a note back saying the recipent 
>has gotten the mail or opened the mail?

You can put lines (two) in your custom headers for return-receipts but
consider a few things:  Very few services send back return receipts.
The receipt doesn't acknowledge anything other than the mail reached
the service, not the recipient, and I'm not aware of any that
acknowledge when the mail was read (though maybe an internal network
setup might).  Some services charge for Internet email usage so
by auto requesting a return receipt, you may be causing the recipient
to pay extra money so you could get a receipt (actually I believe any
such service merely ignores return receipt requests via Internet
anyway).

In your pine configuration file, you'd add:

     customized-hdrs        = Return-Receipt-To:
                              Read-Receipt-To:

Then when writing the email, execute Rich Headers (I think it's Ctrl-R
on the menu) and fill in both of these fields with your email address
or the email address you'd want the return receipt to go to.

Remember, few services support this, and best be sure if the service
does support it they don't charge extra for email lest you'll cause
your recepient some additional charges.

I believe that if the .pinerc entry "user-id" has the value of the null
string, as opposed to no value at all, Pine will prompt each time.

If you edit the pinerc directly, the null string is represented by a pair
of double quotes.  If you use the config screen, you can "Add" then hit
RETURN immediately.

Warning: this info is from memory from a long time ago...

While we're on the subject, is there a way to disable the users ability 
to print the help file?

Thanks,

Check out http://www.uni-frankfurt.de/~fp/uudeview/
or ftp diane.rbi.informatik.uni-frankfurt.de directory /pub/dist/frank
where	uudeview-0.4.11.tar.gz is Unix sourcecode
	uudvd04d.zip           is the DOS binary
	uudvw04d.zip           is the Windows binary



A very nice program that does Base64, UU and XX in both DOS/Windows and Unix
and both directions...

Is there a way to send e-mail with Pine 3.91 so that I'll get a 
confirmation that the message was received?  Thanks for the help.

Thanks for the suggestion, but customized-hdrs and default-composer-hdrs
affect message composition (and, in fact, i already employ them for this
purpose).  I was concerned in my query with message reading.  I still
haven't found any options that enable me to designate additional headers
for the non-"full-headers" mode display.  I suspect such options need to 
be added...

Pine 3.91 does not have that option, but Pine 3.92 will...

Hi is there a way to filter files, from say this listserv, into a pine 
mail folder, which i created called pine. Im sure ppl have asked this Q a 
million times, sorry about that.
We have Unix,Solaris 2.3 (system V), and pine 3.91. There is a utility 
called proamail i think, that should do the job, but i have no idea. Any 
ideas, are appreciated
Thanks in advance

Hi,

We recently added reverse alias lookup to our sendmail configuration. 
This feature substitutes the alias for the user id in the From: field 
(for instance, frf7789@hazeltine.com becomes firestine@hazeltine.com). 
Elm seems to have adjusted well to this change without any adjustments on 
our part. Messages sent with Pine continue to have the userid in the 
From: field rather than the alias. I have looked through the 
documentation without finding any way to modify the From: field, other 
than a Reply-To: custom header. Am I missing something?

Thanks,

Fred

I'm having the same problem.  I got the source code off

The =XX looks as a mimecoded character, and 20 hex is the same as a
space.
Have you maybe written a space-character, at the end of some line(s) ?

OrderSubj is what I use too, and it is better than nothing.
 
But, because it orders all messages with a given subject according to the 
time in which they were *received*locally*, rather than in terms of the 
(universal, GMT) time at which they were *transmitted*, often the 
ordering is jumbled and makes it it difficult to make sense of the thread.

(i.e. responses precede the originating message of the thread).

I have a group of users that are using some weird 3270 card in their
machines to communicate with our unix systems and have some weird cursor
control problem (they tell me) when I set the global pine.conf file to have
an nntp server defined.

A dirty way around this I've found is to put some gibberish in the
news-collections variable in their personal .pinerc files, which makes
the news group part of the screen vanish entirely. But pine also
complains about this unintelligible stuff at startup. 

Is there anything I can set in a users .pinerc file that makes pine not
list news collections, or even the lower half of the news collection
screen, if the global file has a server defined?

procmail is the tool you want:

[ begin .procmailrc ]
PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin
MAILDIR=$HOME/Mail
LOGFILE=$HOME/.procmail.log
                                           
:0:                                      
* ^From: UniqueString
pine

[end .procmailrc]

change UniqueString to something which appears in the "From:" or "From" 
line (whichever you specify right before UniqueString)

procmail is very smart.  If it can't figure out what to do with 
something, it leaves it alone.

    Pine by itself will not do this.  If you are on a Un*x(-like) system,
you can use a mail preprocessor like procmail to do mail filtering: take
action on mail from the particular sender and dump everything else, by
default, into your mailbox (or however you wnat to set it up).  For

When I try access a folder that is setting on my Linux server I get an

I have imap, SMTP, pop, pop3 all set up properly, in fact I can access a 
folder from inside Linux, but can't do the opposite.  This is not clear 
to me, is there anybody that had a similar situation?

Are you using Telnet to access pine on a Unix box?

If so, go into Sessions -> Setup Keys and the dialog box should be self 
explanatory...

How's your new Power Mac PCI doing?

I'm having problems with pine when adding attachments.  The error message I get 
is:
	error positioning /path of file

I am running imap and pop on the mail server.

Any ideas?

several people told me that I can simply edit the header fields when 
composing a mail message which is also a post.

can anyone explain to me how I do this?  I only see the newsgroup, 
attachment and Subject lines.

Thanks

What is the _exact_ error message?  Can you telnet to port 143 on the
server and get a one-line IMAP banner?

Hi,

I am using Pine 3.91 since 1 year and I still have a problem I can
solve. It's about 'From:' field in outgoing mail. This one contains
the hostname of my mail exchanger, 'Pinuche' :
login@Pinuche.grbb.polymtl.ca. I would like to get just the domainame
: login@grbb.polymtl.ca. I have correctly configured my sendmail.cf on
my hosts in order to remove hostname from 'From:' when using 'mail' or
'Mail' but with pine, I still have this problem. However, I have the
lines in pine.conf :

user-domain=grbb.polymtl.ca
use-only-domain-name=no

I tried to use :
user-domain=
use-only-domain-name=yes 

but with no more success. I checked that my .pinerc doesn't have
another configuration.

I ask SGI technical support, and they also receive my email with a
wrong "From:" header. They said that 'From:' is generated by 'pine'
and not by 'sendmail'. They suggested me to force pine not to generate
the 'From:' or to force pine to generate a 'From:' header with
username and domainame by modifying the sources. 

Any idea how to do that ?				 Gildas.

Your message arrived here with the address you want in the From:
header, as shown below.  Either configuration you listed will generate
this address.  I don't know where the header is getting re-written,
but it is leaving Pine correctly.

Hi,

No. Pine is defining the 'From:' header with 'Pinuche' in it and I
don't want this. As I said, SGI tech support and my recipient (my
account in another university) are receiving a 'From:' header with
'Pinuche' in it. As far as I know, you are really the only one
receiving my 'From:' header correctly.  Furthermore, 'Mail' utility
which uses 'sendmail' to generate 'From:' header doesn't create this
problem. Finally, SGI tech support said me that they could see by the
position of the wrong 'From:' header (I think they received my email
with 2 'From:' headers) that this one was created by Pine.

Maybe the best thing is to not define 'From:' in Pine and leave
sendmail doing that. Do you know how to modify sources to do that ?

Thanks in advance.				  Gildas.

Gildas,

wy don't you try to use "Reply-To: <address>" in the "Customized-hdrs"? That will workaround 
the problem.

Ciao,

when reading emails which are more than one page long i would like to see the Subject-Field 
in the top of my Screen. All I see is "MESSAGE TEXT".

Is there any chance to get it in one of the next releases of PINE?

(Or: Is it already there and I haven't ssen it? I'm surte I read all of the Tech Notes ;-)

Ciao,
 Michael Joswig

Hi and thanks for your answer. I don't need "Reply-To: <address>" to
workaround the problem since even if the email address contains a
hostname in it, email arrives to the right place. However, I don't
want to see a hostname in my "From:" header.

Gildas.

1) using kermit, I connect to my school (Novell network), I login and 
select, 'telnet' to get to my mail account at capitalist.princeton.edu

2) I begin to read my mail and news through pine.

3) at some point, usually while composing a message, something happens 
(sorry, that's all I can say.  Nothing visisble hapens, but obviously 
something is happening) and all of a sudden I lose the ability to type.

that's not even the weird part.

Whatever character/key I press, it starts printing out OLD keystrokes 
from much earlier in the session (always from the same session).  I get 
to see everything I typed, all over again, and when it finishes, it just 
hangs there like a program in WinDows running on only 8MB RAM and never 
comes back.

eventually I get logged out for being inactive (nothing I can input) and 
then in 15 minutes (time set by my novell network to punish idle 
connectors) I can login again and everything is fine for a few days, 
maybe a week.

Sounds to be like some type of buffer is being kept and it is getting 
confused and rather than taking input it is giving output, but I don't 
really know.

Anyone have a guess as to what's going on?

I'm using a hayes-like modem with flow control. if that helps.


Thanks

don't know -- I've been using (really road testing) pine for exactly

Gildas,
My goodness, you do seem sure of yourself!  But I'm equally sure that you
are wrong: you have not substantiated the claim that "Pine is defining the
'From:' header with 'Pinuche' in it"

I say that because in previous correspondence with us you've confirmed
that the messages Pine stores in your sentmail folder have the *correct*
From: address.  This means that the problem is not in Pine, but outside.

Also, it is a fact that Pine does not send a different From: to different
recipients, so if some recipients are seeing one From: address and others
are seeing another, it is guaranteed that some software outside of Pine is
modifying the header in one of those cases.

The fact that messages from "mail" do not exhibit the problem is a
red-herring, since "mail" relies on sendmail to create the From: line,
and the fact that sendmail creates From: lines as you want them says
nothing about what it does with pre-existing From: lines.

I guess you believe that the messages we see here in Seattle with the
correct From: address are somehow modified by our own sendmail to make
them look correct?  Alas, for as long as you believe the SGI tech support
person, you will be on an endless quest.

OK, OK. I believe you Terry ;-)

Seriously, why don't force pine to not generate the From: header and
leave sendmail doing the job since it seems to do it correctly for
Mail ?

Because it is entirely correct for the MUA to create the From: header, and
it is entirely incorrect for the MTA to change it!   (And I can assure you
that there are lots of places where the sendmail config would *not* put in
the correct From: address!)

This doesn't exactly fit into the realm of Pine but I'm getting no 
answers from SCO so I'll ask you people.

My MMDF mail handler (Please, no hissing) _seems_ to support a .forward 
file but SCO offers no documentation for it's use.  I pay for tech 
support but the support department seems to choose to not support the 
.forward file and suggested some workarounds using .maildelivery (which I 
DO use.)  But I feel like I'd still like to know how and what the 
.forward file is used for.  Maybe some docs (man page) from another UNIX?
(Unless restricted, of course)

Thanks in advance.

I liked the way plain ol unix mail saved the messages that you read
automagically in ~/mbox.  It kept the ones you haven't read in the
system mailbox.  Can pine do this?

Correctness is a very dangerous goal to pursue.  Correctness is not a
well-defined property for such things as mail user agents (MUAs).
Unlike mathematics, where we can claim that a proof is 'correct', we
cannot in general make such an assertion for MUAs.

Rather than asking "Is it correct?" for mail software, we should ask,
"Does it work?"  The latter is an answerable question.  The former is
meaningless for most mail software and leads to nothing but flame
wars.

Those who are thinking of RFC-conformance are advised to ask "Does it
conform to RFC-xxx?" rather than "Is it correct?"  The former is an
answerable question.  The latter, as emphasized above, leads to nothing
but flame wars.

Here are two common ways of defining correctness for an MUA.

1. An MUA is 'correct' if it works as expected in its intended environment.
2. An MUA is 'correct' if it behaves in accordance with RFCs chosen as
   applicable by the software developer.

People who use the concept of 'correctness' for mail software seldom
specify which definition of correctness they are using.  Thus we have
arguments at cross-purposes between users (who normally use definition
1) and software developers (who often use definition 2).

It might not be easy to satisfiy both criteria at the same time, but
one should certainly try.  Attempting to satisfy only one of these two
defnitions of correctness while ignoring the other is probably unwise.

Going back to the quoted text:

>Because it is entirely correct for the MUA to create the From: header, and
>it is entirely incorrect for the MTA to change it! 

The RFC I am thinking of -- RFC822 -- does not separately talk about
the MUA and MTA.  The dividing line between MUA and MTA varies in
different environments.  No RFC can safely make any assumption about
where this dividing line lies.  Let's see what RFC822 says:

     4.4.1.  FROM / RESENT-FROM

        This field contains the identity of the person(s)  who  wished
        this  message to be sent.  The message-creation process should
        default this field  to  be  a  single,  authenticated  machine
        address,  indicating  the  AGENT  (person,  system or process)
        entering the message.  If this is not done, the "Sender" field
        MUST  be  present.  If the "From" field IS defaulted this way,
        the "Sender" field is  optional...

RFC822 is vague about who creates the From: field.  It talks about 'The
message-creation process'.

It is quite permissible and possible for the MTA to play the rule of
MUA, as in the following command given at the UNIX shell prompt:

     % sendmail mrc@CAC.Washington.EDU
     please ignore Dhesi
     ^D

The above violates no RFC, because no RFC tells us what the MUA, or
MTA, or MUA+MTA combination, looks like.  All we can say is that
*before* the message is transported, the From: field 'should' exist,
and that if the From: field does not exist, then Sender: must exist.

So, I would rephrase the quoted text as:

   1. It is entirely correct for the MUA and initial MTA, acting as a
      cooperating entities, to create the From: header.  As a corollary,
      it is entirely correct for the MUA to create a From: header and
      for the initial MTA to change it, provided both entities act in
      cooperation and the final result is usable for replies in
      accordance with RFC822.

   2. It is entirely correct for the MUA to create the From: header if it
      is the intention of the administrators of the specific environment
      that the MUA do so or be permitted to do so.

   3. It is entirely incorrect for an MUA to create a From: header if it
      is the intention of the administrators of the specific environment
      that the initial MTA do so and not the MUA.

>...there are lots of places where the sendmail config would *not* put in
>the correct From: address!)

There are probably very few such places, but I'm sure there are some.
They would correspond to item 2 above.

It would be unwise to assume that all 'places' correspond to item 2.

Does anyone know of an easy way to randomize the .signature used for each

Dear gentlemans,
using pine3.91 are created queue files with right UID but bad GID (GID=

Could you advise me. I use SGI(OS iris 5.3) mail server.

Pine doesn't actually enter the message into the spool area 
(/var/spool/mqueue on IRIX), but instead simply pipes it into sendmail.

So there might be a problem with your sendmail protection.  Can you do an:

	ls -l /usr/lib/sendmail

It should look something like this I think:

-rwsr-xr-x    1 root     sys       297016 Jun 14 10:22 /usr/lib/sendmail

Note the "rws" at the start of the protections.  This gives sendmail "set 
uid" mode: it can perform operations as if it were running as the uid who 
owns the file (root in this case).

Also check that sendmail is owned by "root" and gorpu "sys".

If these are incorrect you will need to get a Systems Guru to fix them as 
it requires the special privileges of the root username.

Basically a forward file is used to (surprise) forward mail to another
account. It usually contains an email address, to which the MDA will
forward the mail to.

Alternately, a .forward file can be used to call an external program,
such as procmail such as:

"|IFS=' ' && exec /usr/local/bin/procmail -f- || exit 75 #cdh"

>From aliases(4) on a Solaris 2.4 machine:

  Automatic Forwarding
     When an alias (or address) is resolved to the name of a user
     on  the  local  host,  sendmail(1M)  checks for a ~/.forward
     file, owned by the intended recipient, in that  user's  home
     directory,  and  with  universal read access.  This file can
     contain one or more addresses or aliases as described above,
     each of which is sent a copy of the user's mail.
 
     Care must be taken to avoid creating addressing loops in the
      ~/.forward file.  When forwarding mail between machines, be
     sure that the destination machine does not return  the  mail
     to the sender through the operation of any YP aliases.  Oth-
     erwise, copies of the message may ``bounce.''  Usually,  the
     solution  is  to  change  the YP alias to direct mail to the
     proper destination.
 
     A backslash before a  username  inhibits  further  aliasing.
     For  instance,  to  invoke  the  vacation  program,  user js
     creates a ~/.forward file that contains the line:
 
          \js, "|/usr/ucb/vacation js"
 
     so that one copy of the message is sent  to  the  user,  and
     another is piped into the vacation program.

Hope this helps.

Chris

   I am not sure I liked the way /usr/ucb/mail does this (actually
   I do not like /usr/ucb/mail at all), but you can customize pine
   to do something similar.

   Here we arrange as a default that all messages in the user inbox
   are moved to a default user's place if not moved elsewhere (this
   is to avoid the inbox on a spool filesystem with limited space
   get cluttered). I personally disabled this feature, since I'm
   keeping my inbox "ordered" (I like to archive all read mails by
   project, or delete useless ones, but keep in inbox those which
   are "in evidence").

   Look at your .pinerc or pine.conf file, I see that mine has
   no-auto-move-read-msgs in the feature list, while our system
   default has auto-move-read-msgs. Also I keep read-message-folder
   equated to "" (the null string) while the system default has
   a filename there.
   Pine Technical Doc should explain all about this.

Here's a weird problem I'm having:

Pine is not using the full screen available though LINES and TERM set 
correctly.

Details:

I use my computer at home to log in to a mainframe at work which contains
the pine executable.  My comm software is emulating a vt100 using 42 lines.
I log in, set TERM=vt100, export it, set LINES=42, export it.  I suppose
by now you realize the mainframe is running unix.  "vi" works like a charm,
so therefore I'm convinced it's not the emulator, or mainframe settings.
Also "less" also works correctly with these settings.

Any help is greatly appreciated.

    Place the cursor anywhere in the header and press Ctrl-R for "rich 
headers."  This will display all headers you (or Pine by default) have 
defined.  You may then edit to your heart's content.

	Once again going to the config screens and reading the *help*
available will reveal amazing things......

         OPTION: Read-Message-Folder

By virtue of specifying a folder name here, Pine will be configured to
save all messages which you have read during a session into the designated
"read messages" folder.  This allows you to more easily distinguish
between your really new email (in your INBOX) and those which you have
already read.  Depending on how you define the "auto-move-read-messages"
setting in the "feature-list", you may or may not be asked when you quit
Pine if you want read messages to be moved to this folder.  In either
case, moving the messages means they will be deleted from your INBOX.

When we see it (rarely), the message has control-M characters in it.
Now that I noticed this, I've verified it every time, maybe 5 times.
The messages originate on PCs and get inserted with both control-J and
control-M at end of line, non-unix-style.

Try replacing the control-M's with something else by editing mbox.
Careful, if you use mtext format, to do a one-for-one replacement of
the characters; sed might be good.  For mbox format, just delete them.

Comments from the pine team would be welcome of course.

There's a problem when you press ^G.  The help is only printed on the
top line of the page.

How do I get pico to use a person home directory when you go to files
instead of the root?

I'm looking for a file and I press on a directory.  I press 'Y' to
enter and pico says 'File not found: "directoryname".  It works if I
do it again.

I pressed parent directory once and pico didn't go there.

How do I change the directory to the root?  "/" didn't work.

Thanks.

I did do that, that's how I was able to get a core dump via running 
pine.  Actually, I had to add an include (<utime.h>) to c-client/os_d-g.h 
to get the thing to compile.  At any rate, the point I'm at is I have 
pine, pico, imapd and mtest all compiled but I'm getting the mentioned 
error. 

any ideas?

Assuming you have the Pine 3.91 source distribution anywhere you will 
find the program you require already written (it is VERY simple!) in:

	contrib/utils/ansiprt.c

If you have the compressed tar archive but don't have the quota to unpack 
it all you can unpack just this one file using a command something like this:

	zcat pine3.91.tar.Z | tar xvf - pine3.91/contrib/utils/ansiprt.c

You may have to play around to get it exactly right; I'm at the end of 
the day here and tiredly heading home!

As I tried to compile pine on an SGI Indy arunning IRIX 5.3 
by saying "build sgi", I got the following Error Messages:

   ld:
   Unresolved:
   fatal
   *** Error code 1 (bu21)
   *** Error code 1 (bu21)
   *** Error code 1 (bu21)
   *** Error code 1 (bu21)

Has anyone ever built pine on SGI and/or encountered a similar
problem? If necessary, I can send the full compiler output.

Thanks in advance

I haven't seen the Encore port of Pine, but most Unix ports of Pine
consult the terminal device directly via an ioctl and don't consult
environment variables.  If you can't do an "stty rows xx" on your
system, you should ask whomever did the Encore port to make the
necessary changes...

It seems that Sending Mail (regular Email) is very slow since I started 
to use Pine for Newsgroups. Any solutions to this?  Perhaps using a 
separate newsreader (my provider doesn't have anything else installed, 
though).

Bjorn,

Simply having Pine configured to access newsgroups should not affect
the speed of sending mail.  Is it possible that your system is more
heavily loaded than before?  Sometimes a relatively small increase in
system load can have a dramatic effect on performance...

Thanks for the request!

I'm having a severe locking problem with Pine.  Our mail spool
directories are NFS mounted to 3 clients: Solaris 2.4 and AIX 4.1
machines.  Whenever anyone runs pine on a client, it creates a
<username>.lock file and the Pine session hangs.  It says "Opening
INBOX" and the .lock file has the current time as a timestamp.
Can anyone point me in the right direction?

What's the official "best way" to compile Pine 3.91 on Solaris?  For
some reason (I am not sure why, it has been so long), I have been
using gcc.  What do other people use?

Although at times it may be a waste of disk space, I would like the 
ability to have multiple Fcc's for a single message.  I can't get 3.91 to 
accept it.

Is there a way?

Thanks,

I know what you mean; did something similar.  You might want to generalize it
and include many ANSI codes, since lots are useful.

Printer-on is  "\033[5i", ie, ESC followed by left-bracket followed by 5i.
Printer-off is "\033[4i".

Almost certainly, the problem is not the lock files, but rather the
infamous lockd/statd daemons which are invoked by fcntl() locking.  It is
not a Pine bug; rather, Pine NFS access on SVR4 tickles an operating
system bug.  Scream at SUN and IBM for providing broken software.

I am responding to your similar bug report to pine@cac.washington.edu
under separate cover, and will include a documentation file which
describes the locking problem.

Hello, I may not be looking too far ahead into this but, I kept (exported)
a email message with a gif attachment which went into the home directory

beforehand ;'(   And naturally, looking at it online or downloading it you

Short of bringing it back in as an attachment and possibly resending it

that the only way?

Yes, this is a known bug that will be fixed in Pine 3.92.  If you
substitute the imap-3.5 toolkit with the imap-3.6.BETA toolkit and rebuild
Pine and imapd you'll get the fix; otherwise just wait until Pine 3.92
comes out.

The bug is that the calculation of the "RFC 822 size" (the size of the
message in RFC 822 format using CR LF newlines) was a guesstimate (Unix
size + # of newlines) in the older version, and the calculation didn't do
the right thing with CR LF newlines.  The newer version handles CR LF
newlines that are already in the message, and doesn't count them twice.

The question is; how did those CR's get in the file, since sendmail is
supposed to suppress them.  Was NFS used from the PC?

The official way is with SUN's compiler, and that is what the sol part
is designed for.  As many people have noticed, the sol port does not build
using gcc without substantial modification.  About 90% of the sol port are
specific details for the native Solaris compiler, only about 10% is for
the Solaris operating system.

However, there *will* be a gso (GNU Solaris) port, either in Pine 3.92 or
a future version, and this will become the recommended and supported
version.  We too have grown weary of SUN's shenanigans with its C
compiler, and may drop support for the native Solaris compiler entirely
(in other words, *require* gcc).
