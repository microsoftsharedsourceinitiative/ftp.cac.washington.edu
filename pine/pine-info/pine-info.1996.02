News reading, including "catching up", is explained in Pine's built-in help.

Type "?" at Pine's Main Menu then skip down to the section on reading 
News (hint: use the "W" command to search for a string).

Cheers,

 Hi Lea,
contrary to the FCC on other mailers, pine use the File Carbon Copy to 
specify the folder where a copy of outgoing mail will be saved, instead 
of the dedault one generically called SentMail.
Kind Regards
CArlos

I have a client with a list of 300+ addresses, not in Pine addressbook 
format, that he wants to send a single message to.  In addition, he wants 
the list to be in blind-carbon format so that recipients do not have to 
wade through screenfuls of addresses before getting to the message.  The 
list, as it's formatted right now, would probably work fine if I could 
get it into the Bcc: field, but I haven't yet successfully done that...
Is there a way to read a file in to a Compose header field, and if so, 
how do you do that?  
Because of the size of the list editting would probably be almost as bad 
as entering the addresses individually into the addressbook (this is NOT 
a user who could ably use something like vi or emacs).
Any ideas gratefully accepted...

Lea

    No.  Pine by itself will not do this for you.  You have to use some 
other software which processes mail _before_ Pine gets hold of it.  On 
Unix systems, procmail is commonly used (although it is not totally 
simple in all matters for neophytes).

In pico, Ctrl-Space advances through text word-by-word, which is something
_very_ convenient. 

However, when logged into my systems via modem, using any number of
communications packages (procomm plus, win95's hyperterm, wincomm pro,
commworks, etc..) Ctrl-Space doesn't seem to be possible (I don't think
the comm software was designed with "ctrl-space" in mind)

Can pine be configured, or even recompiled, so that some other keystroke
is used in place of Ctrl-Space? I think that would be easier than trying
to get the comm software patched and/or configured for ctrl-space,
especially since this may not be a possibility for some packages. 

TIA,

BTW - MS Kermit (v3.13, for DOS) is the =only= serial communication
package I've found that sends a Ctrl-Space that can be interpretted by
pico.

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:
PINE HAS JUST RECENTLY SENT MY SOME HELPFUL INFORMATION ABOUT THIS 
PROGRAM.  I WAS WONDERING IF THERE WAS ANY MORE AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME 
BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO LEARN AS MUCH ABOUT THE PROGRAM AS I CAN.  IF 
ANYONE COULD PLEASE SEND IT TO ME I WOULD BE VERY GREATFUL. 

THANKS,
ANDREA

"Slow" is relative.  If you have a lot of RAM, then Pine's mbox driver is
the fastest of all.  Text searches are almost instantaneous.  If you
don't, then an alternative format such as tenex is faster since it doesn't
beat on virtual RAM, at a cost of disk traffic every time you access a
message (and slow text searches).

The reason why the mbox driver keeps a snapshot in virtual memory is that
you can't update an mbox format file in place because messages can grow.
Thus, you need a scratch copy.  Either the scratch copy is on disk or it
is in memory.  Matters are further complicated by a requirement on several
systems that the inode be preserved, so you can't write to a new file and
then rename (or rather, you can on some systems but not on others, and
it's not predictable which ones are "safe").  So a disk-based scratch copy
would have to be copied back to the main file.

Between this problem, and the fact that UW machine have adequate memory
but UW internal users have disk quotas and may not be able to keep 2x
their mail file, the memory scratch copy was more attractive to us.  But I
can understand why a person running a 50 user timesharing system with 16MB
of RAM may feel otherwise.

We've considered providing an alternative mbox driver that does the disk
copy, but given the facts that we don't have an internal need for it (we
use tenex format if memory is a concern), that most external sites these
days have ample memory and/or use tenex format, and that we have plenty of
other more urgent tasks to occupy us, it's somewhat low on the queue.

It would not be too hard to write such an alternate driver, I think.  If
someone wanted it bad enough to pay me to do it in my (woefully
inadequate) free time, I could probably have it in short order.

Norbert,
There are several MIME decoders available, for multiple platforms.
One is the "mpack" program from CMU.  I've attached a pointer to it.

This used to be an easy solution when i used Pegasus. Now that I'm on a 
network, it's not. Or is it? Someone said make a filtering rule saying if 
from is ***.adress then delete. But , that I don't know how to do. Even 
better, If I was emailed by someone I'd like to be able to shutdown them 
emailing me (is this bouncing?)  forcing the email right back in their 
face! According to Pegasus , this is true mail filtering or 
blocking...like *69.  Someone tell me how in a clear set of instructions 
for all readers to understand. 

Thanks :)

Sorry This doesn't work !!!

Result is:

Andreas.Muck <andi@stud.uni-karlsruhe.de>

In our case this produces an invalid domain.

Has anyone a fix for it --- it seems that userdb
does not work for non-local mails!
Is there a way to *force* the noncanonify option in sendmail
(or pine) to make it put out only local mail.

Yours

Thanks a lot!

Greetings, 

How do you set the prefix for replying, (the "border-on-copy" in
some other mailers)? as in

>From:  user@node
>Subject: foo

>blah, blah, blah GINGER

The default of ">" must be configurable somehow, though I haven't 
found it.  I've tried changing the .mailrc indexprefix= value
to no avail.

Regards,

Carlos, your message came through blank.  Please re-send, because if you 
have an answer to this I really need to see it and I'm sure the list 
would be interested too...
And while I'm at it, I haven't heard back from anyone at all yet on this 
(David Miller?  Are you out there?) and my client hasn't forgotten about 
it...meanwhile, I've tried everything I can think of and done information 
searches and all that and still haven't come up with anything...
Frustration R Us...

Thanks for any help anyone can provide!

Lea

It is not possible to change the quote character in Pine 3.91 (short of 
obtaining the source, changing it there and recompiling).  I believe I 
recall one of the Pine Developers saying it would be user-configurable in 
Pine 3.92 though (forgive me if I'm wrong, guys!).

Cheers,

Mike Brudenell                                         <pmb1@york.ac.uk>

Could someone provide me with the ftp site for the latest version of PINE
for PC programme and documentation. And perhaps a personal response from
someone who uses it as a personal copy to read/reply offline. 

Thanks very much.

Okay, I know that I can get the header info by allowing the H command.

How about the mail sending trail (the lines above the header that show 
how it got transferred from server to server while being sent)?  Is there 
a way to get it to be seen on pine?  (the mail sending trail is useful 
for finding server addresses for talk and finger commands)  Right now, 
the only way I can go and see this trail part is to save it to a folder, 
then goto something like pico or emacs and read it from there.

Direct replies appreciated too.

Hi Edward!

	I did the exact same thing.  My e-mail address is shorter at 
rbaqai@uci.edu, but my unix is at rbaqai@ea.oac.uci.edu

	Now a problem that I see that you are probably going to have is 
that your unix account name (fenstere) is different than your e-mail 
(ed).  I think this may still be a problem.

	In any case, to change the user-domain to jhu.edu  just enter 
that line in the user-domain field in the config for pine.

	Now, my question is, how do I get rid of an X-Sender line.  I 
really don't need that line in the e-mail I send.

Well, duh!! My brain must've been asleep! As soon as I posted that 
message, I remembered I could do "pine -h" for help, and lo and behold, I 
learned my answer- typing "pine -p alt.pinerc" will give the desired

I'm sorry for posting what seems to have been misleading information 
here.  It would be good if this worked, but it looks as if it doesn't.

I've just tried to follow my own description, using the VMS PINE
client and trying to save to a remote folder on a unix system, e.g 
"S {dotted.host}mail/mail", and I find that it does not work; instead
of saving to a remote folder, it actually creates a local folder called 
{DOTTED.HOST}MAIL/MAIL   (!!!) on the VMS system.
  
"G {dotted.host}mail/mail", on the other hand, works fine, so it's
clear that Yehavi's VMS PINE is partly able to reference remote folders.

I don't know just how I'd got the impression before that I had
been able to make this work.

Once again, apologies.

I can't be sure that the converse scheme would really work, i.e
running PINE client on unix and IMAPD on VAX/VMS, because I've never
tried running the VMS IMAPD.  I think it looks hopeful ... but I see that
Yehavi himself did not suggest this as a solution, so maybe he knows
of a reason why it can't work? 

best regards

-- I am a big fan of mail pre-sorting.  I have used filter for some

they both deal with e-mail.  

  My understanding of filter is that it is that it is a program which
may or may not be available on your system.  The man page for filter
explains everything that you would need to know to set up your
filtering activites.  It essentially consists of a special command in
your .forward file, telling it to use the filter program, and then a
filter-rules file which determines how your mail gets sorted.

  If you can get it on your system, procmail is much more robust at
sorting.

Dear Sir,

	I have compiled the pop3d in the distribution of pine.3.91. It
runs quite well, but the program doesnt'recognize the passwords longer then
8 chars. Is it possible to change this limit?

Any help it'll be welcome

Please, replay to me at fabriani@rmcisadu.let.uniroma1.it too, because my
nttp server loses many news. 

Thanks

   Incidentally in Italian the abbreviation Cc: may also mean
   "copia per conoscenza" lit. "copy for [your] knowledge" that is
   "copy for [your] information", which also fits nicely.

Does anyone know how to get pine to just put the name of the Distribution List

Hello,

I have yet another feature request for PINE.  I haven't been
diddling in the newsgroup much lately, but a nice feature for
the next version of PINE would be a from-index search.  I get
a lot of mail with totally irrelevant subjects, and sometimes
in a list of 100 messages, it's difficult to find the appro-
priate message.  I'd like to see PINE have a feature, from the
folder index, where you can, say, hit 'w' for whereis, type
your keyword, then maybe hit "^W" to search INSIDE messages.
PINE could simply highlight ('select') the messages that apply,
or perhaps flag them "I"mportant or "K"eyed or something like
that.

I'd also like to reiterate my request to make sure PINE has the
ability to cancel messages posted to newsgroups.   :)

TIA,

    I could only support use of this and the other patch mentioned
provided you are running an 8BITMIME version of sendmail or equivalent,
such as BSD Sendmail 8.7* (presently 8.7.3) or a number of other MTAs
which perform properly when faced with 8-bit MIME data.

    Outside of the US in Europe, I am aware that many sites have been
running customized sendmails for some time or have upgraded to one of
the 8BITMIME-aware versions, and I have no problem with applying such
a patch to Pine if you're impatient and have such a sendmail.

    Pine3.92, when released, will also permit you to send 8BITMIME mail
messages when you configure it to speak to such an SMTP (ESMTP) server.
As more sites upgrade their sendmails, this will help to make C-T-E=8BIT
mail much more common.

Hello,

	I have an account in a ultrix system, they (admin.) installed pine
3.91 there and I want to use pine to access my mailbox in another system,
IMAP doesn't work at all and POP3 successfully open the mailbox, but dump
me right back to the prompt, giving me an errore message:

Bug in Pine detected: "Received abort signal".  Exiting pine. 

But, if I go use pine3.90, this problem goes away.  The only problem is, 
I don't have enough disk space to have my own copy of pine3.90 in my 
directory.  Is there any work around for 3.91?

Subject: pine 3.91 and imap 3.6.BETA

Has anyone built and used pine 3.91 with imap 3.6.BETA (instead of imap
3.5? which comes with pine 3.91)?

I'm just asking to try to avoid any potential big problems which I
haven't yet seen.  In fact, I have succesfully built this combo, but I
had to rename pine's imap.c:imap_user() (also in pine.h and send.c) to
avoid a conflict with imap 3.6.BETA's imap2.c:imap_user().  They appear
to server different purposes.

As I said, I have successfully built on this system using ucbcc:

$ uname -a
SunOS grape.cis.pitt.edu 5.4 Generic_101945-36 sun4m sparc

and on this one using gcc 2.7.2:

$ uname -a
SunOS red-viole 4.1.3_U1 1 sun4m

A related question would be what patches (if any) are recommended for
pine 3.91?  I saw some mention of a previously posted patch a while ago,
but I no longer have the post (it was from one of th pine team) and when
I *did* have it, I couldn't find the referenced patch anyway.

Thanks for any comments you might have,
Rudy

hi.  I just started using pine and I have a few questions:

1) I read my mail remotely using imap.  my real e-mail address is
   mcguirk@indirect.com, but pine seems to just combine my username
   on the local system (djm) with the domain name I gave it
   (indirect.com), and so it comes up with an address that I don't want
   (although it works), djm@indirect.com.  how do I tell it the
   correct address to use?

2) is there a way I can store the username and password (or at least
   just the username) for each imap server somewhere so I don't have
   to type them every time?

3) I tried postponing some messages, then I decided I didn't want to send
   them, so I deleted them from the postponed-msgs folder.  after that,
   I was left with a 0-byte postponed-msgs folder, and pine would ask
   me every time I sent a message if I wanted to continue a postponed
   message.  if I said yes, it figured out that there were really no
   postponed messages, but then it came up with an error message
   trying to delete the postponed-msgs folder.  it wouldn't stop asking
   me about the postponed-msgs until I got on the imap server and deleted
   the postponed-msgs folder myself.  is this a bug?

4) when is pine 3.92 coming out?  I've heard it will have support
   for PGP.

thanks.

Does anybody know how to configure pine so that I can be anonymous 
instead of my e-mail address showing in the from field?

Followup-to: poster

I am in a peculiar situation that may not be uncommon.

My system administrator has disabled the "forward to procmail" ability of 
sendmail on our system and seems pretty adamant about keeping it that way.

I have set up procmail to filter my incoming mail into several folders
anyway, but I have to run it 'manually' with a script, instead of being
able to have it run automatically via the .forward file.  I also have set
up an 'at' job to run the incoming-script every so often during the
daytime. 

While this is tolerable, I realized that it might be fairly easy to modify
PINE in the following way:

In version 3.91, when the file $HOME/mail.txt exists, PINE looks at the
system INBOX every so often and when it finds mail there, puts it into
$HOME/mail.txt in Tenex format. 

Why couldn't PINE have an "update-folders-command=" option?  In other
words, if this option were non-null, PINE would check the system INBOX,
then if there were mail, it would call that command.  After that it would
look to see if there were new mail in the incoming folders.  For this to
work in a way similar to the 'mail.txt' mode, though, there would have to
be a local file distinct from the system INBOX; "$HOME/mail/mbox.IN",
perhaps?  The name would have to be hardcoded in the same way that
'mail.txt' is now so that PINE could cross check dates between the 
files.  If one still wanted mail in Tenex format, Pine could then 
transfer from mail/mbox.IN to mail.txt.

This might be a nicer method of running procmail (which I find works
beaufully with PINE) than the standard recommended method since procmail
would be run only when one is actually using pine.  It should work for
other mailfilters as well.

Comments?  Likelyhood of inclusion?

This is not caused by the .lock files, or the /tmp PID files, but rather
by the infamous rpc.statd and rpc.lockd daemons.  These charming critters
go to great lengths to preserve their locks over reboots, whether or not
those locks are actually in use by anyone.

There is a directory on /etc that holds the statd/lockd state, and you
need to blow away the contents in that directory.

The permanent solution is not to use NFS to access your mail, but to use
IMAP instead.  statd/lockd get triggered whenever NFS is in use on SVR4
based systems such as Solaris.  SUN insists that statd/lockd work, but
privately admits that they don't when they are stressed in even minor
ways.

This message happens when Pine detects that some other program has
modified the folder.  Specifically, it determines that the folder's size
has changed, and at the very beginning of the new data there does not
appear to be the start of a new message.

This may not necessarily be something wrong.  Some mailers tend to write a
newline in front of all new mail, whether or not it is needed, and Pine
3.91 would complain about seeing the newsline.  This is fixed in Pine
3.92; although you can work around it now by having your system's mailer
not write the extraneous newline.

It seems to be impossible to send attachements with Pine without them 
being Base64-encoded, even if their Content-Type is text/plain.

Is there a way (a patch to Pine 3.91 maybe) to avoid this ?

Create the list in your addressbook in the usual way.

When you want to mail to the list, put your own address on
the To: header and put the nickname of the list onto the Bcc:
header.

Mails without a To: addressee can cause problems elsewhere.  You
can afterwards throw away the copy that you sent to yourself.

I think the format of the addressbook is documented.  You 
could create an addressbook for them (or provide the list in a global
addressbook, if it's for public use).

good luck

Pine 3.92 will support the .mime-types mechanism to define the
relationship between file extensions and MIME types.  You can then set
up a mime-types file that matches the PMDF standards...

I was laying in bed last night when my pine program wanted me to logon.  
I said, "Leave me alone Piney baby, I'm tryin to sleep."  That was a 
mistake because then my pine program said, "Jed, your password is no 
longer valid with me."  Now I can't get on so a word of advice,  when 
your pine program comes to you in the night do what it says.

My apologies, the H command does give the full header.  I was using the H 
command with e-mail I had sent, and obviously there is no mail trail 
header for those.

Hi

I am using Pine on my Uni account.  The setup suggests that as I haven't 
defined my sugnature account it will use the default .signature - problem 
is I can't find .signature.  


If I need to create it where would it go??

Many thanks, keep well

Reasons for why this behavior is a feature, not a bug, have been posted
previously, but the bottom line is: if your recipient doesn't support MIME
and/or you don't mind if the text/plain might get slightly modified
enroute, then instead of *attaching* the text, use control-R and *include*
it.

it'd be nice if, in the list of folders, I could see an overview of how 
many messages are in each folder.  I don't know if this is easy to do 
within the IMAP protocol, but I have my mail filtered into a bunch of 
different folders for different mailing lists, and it'd be nice to know 
if there are any messages in each one without having to go through and 
select them one at a time.

Hello All,
	I am having a problem using Pine as a mail handler because the 
Control-C command used to cancel an operation does not work. E.g., when I 
am composing a message, but decide to cancel it, I cannot and cannot get 
out of the message operation except by doing a Control-O to postpone the 
message. I get this error no matter what kind of connection I make to the 
mail server (direct, PPP, or dialup). Our system administrator has said 
that a conflict is present because our Unix system interprets Control-C 
as a reserved command within the server and will not execute it within 
Pine.                        Any suggestions, Joe

Use your favorite editor to create a file named .forward.  Place in that 
file the e-mail adress(es) to which you wish your mail forwarded.

Normally .signature goes in your account's home directory i.e. ~summers.

Merely playing with headers is not sufficiant to really send mail
anonymously.  The best way to send mail anonymously is by using
an anonymous remailer.  If you send a message to

  help@alpha.c2.org

you will get help on using that (more secure) but more complicated
remailer.  Or

  help@anon.penet.fi

For a simpler, slower, and less secure one.

There is also a really excellent website on remailers by "Galactus":
 http://www.stack.urc.tue.nl/~galactus/remailers/

Further discussion of anonymous remailers does not really belong in
comp.mail.pine.  So I am cross posting this to alt.anonymous (I hope that
is the appropriate group) and directing follow-ups there.

Take a look at some of the documents on that page for some of the

Hello there....

I have been trying to rebuild pine 3.91 under Solaris 2.4 using the
gnu gcc compiler. (I am doing this so that I can include the mbox
driver and keep the spool area empty)

The first build falls over with MANY complaints about osdep.h.
So long as one does not do a <build clean> in between, a more
appropriate osdep.h is in place as a result of a copy command in
the makefile.sol in the pico directory. Nevertheless, as can be 
seen below, there are still a couple of problems for pine concerning
type declarations for things like memcpy, strcpy and memcmp (in
routines mtest.c and addrbook.c) - and I wondered if anyone might 
be able to help.

Has anyone already solved this problem?

Cheers,

I sent the following to Pine bug report, but I doubt they will
read it, as it already happened.
If you have suggestions, please Email me. I will not
check this newsgroup very often

Subject: Bug (ID S4144): sent-mail folder should sort differently

Hi there, I've been trying to fix the following problem in many ways,
without results. I read instructions, I wrote to newsgroups, I wrote
to you previously, without success. I do think this is a bug, or
a semi-bug (in the sense that one can live without fixing it). 
However, here it comes:

I'd like to have the sent-mail folder sorted by recipient, in such a
way that I keep only one folder for the carbon copy of the outgoing 
mail, and it would be easy to retrieve any wanted mail, or review
the correspondence with someone.
Therefore I would

1. allow pine to specify a specific sorting method to the folder sent-mail
2. create a new sorting key, the "to:" key (with "date" second)

Hoping that this problem will be taken into account,

best regards,

For what implementation?  If this is for a Freeport type system, I can
give you a Sun patch I did (which will have to be edited for ptx).

As a followup: probably it would be nice to be able to specify sorting
method for every folder. Current 'one-for-all' setup doesn't well suite
into the scenario, when mail gets sorted into many different folders whith
very different contents.

You want to keep a copy in your current account, and pipe a copy to
vacation.  This is mine <wells@capaccess.org>:

"wells,|/usr/ucb/vacation"

SunOS's vacation command will configure all of this for you.  "man
vacation" if it doesn't.

An easy way to get around this particular problem is to forward the
mail from your other account.  If it is a shell account, put the email
address you want it sent to in a file called ".forward".  If not, talk
to your system administrator of that account about forwarding mail.

Hello,
There are a lot of E-Mail clients on our campus. Most of them are ISO-8859-1 
aware, (French beeing the usual langage), but not all can handle Quoted 
Printable. When using the ISO charset to send message, Pine seems to always 
use QP. For received messages, it handles both QP and 8bit (no encoding)
How could I send  straigh 8bits chars, with a header :
Content-Type : Text/Plain, charset = ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Thanks in advance
Pascal A. Dupuis

Well, see, your pine program just wanted some input.  When you refused to
navigate it's menus, it figured you were with another mail 'client' as they
say, POPping off a few messages, and got insulted.  Piney once and for all
got tired of your timesharing ways and decided you were just another _user_ 
and now you're edited out of her configuration for good.

I'm sayin' yer gone.  Kill -9'ed.  That'll teach you to treat Piney like
"just another socket."

So in the future, one 'client' at a time or you'll be spending CPU time with
lots of little 'child processes'.

By the way, I can hardly feel sorry for you... All last night I had to

Of _course_ you didn't know.  You and your little group no longer have 
any permissions around here.  She changed her .lock files, too.

And another thing:  Piney asked me to come by your home directory later and
pick up her dot files.  It's on "elm" street, right?  :?)

Two possible solutions for you to look at:

1.  Add a "Reply-to" header as a custom header (in Pine's Setup 
Configuration screen) with a default value of your proper e-mail 
address.  Messages you send will still be marked as being "From:" your 
local machine, but recipients' mailers should honour the Reply-to address 
when constructing any reply to you.

2.  Check out the "user-domain" value in the Setup Configuration screen.

You don't say whether you are using Pine on a UNIX machine or a PC!  If a 
UNIX machine a better solution is to set up your IMAP daemon to work in 
pre-authenticated mode using the rsh mechanism.  If a PC then you _can_ 
put the information in a file (whose name I forget as we don't use Pine 
on PCs here) *IF* your machine/file is secure against snoopers.

I recall that this is a bug in the imapd 3.5 source code included with 
Pine.  I *think* it is fixed (or at least made more robust) in the 
3.6-BETA version of the imapd source code, available separately from 
ftp.cac.washington.edu.  Just unpack it and use it in place of the 3.5 
code to build both imapd and Pine.

When they are ready.  (They have not yet given a date, but HAVE said they 
are unwilling to give a date :-)

Files included by placing their name in the "Attachments" header field 
are *always* encoded using Base 64.

If you have a text file you don't want Base 64 encoding, simply include 
it in the main message text area using the ^R (Read File) command.

That URL is out of date - please use this one instead:

And for links to pine info use:

Good luck and if you find some pine reviews please let me know
so I can add them to my pine page.

Thanks!

Thanks for your time. I upgraded to the recent version and it 
worked as you said, but it is not serving my purpose. In one 
folder I have seven saved messages. I want to see them as seven 
message in eudora mailbos with the separate subject heading. 
But it is giving me as one message with only the heading for 
the first message.
BTW it gives saparate heading if the pine message is not read. 
Is it possible to unread the pine message? possibly not.
Thanks for time again.

John's suggestion is probably the easiest, but other options include:

 o Rebuilding Pine 3.91 with the latest c-client 3.6 toolkit, which
   I believe fixes some POP-related bugs

 o Get the sysadmin to run an IMAPd...

When I move my cursor through the Newsgroups: field in the header, 
Pine freezes for about 30 seconds.  I am using a remote NNTP server.  
Is this normal?

Hi everyone,

I have been lurking around this group for the last month or so but failed
to see a FAQ.  Is there such a thing?  And if so, where can I find it?

Also, could someone please point me to where I can find a copy of procmail.
The ones I d/l all have a '.deb' extention.  (i.e procmail.deb).  And I have
no idea what it is.  Could someone please explain the deb thing or give me
some pointers to where I can get a working copy of procmail.

Thanx.

HI, 

I have a question being asked by one of my friend.  I would like to know 
how come PINE locks some of the folders after I read the messages, and, 
unfortunately, I wasn't able to return to the messages, or the folers, 
sometimes, the folder will appear like 'sent-mail.lock' or 
'sent-mail-lock' and I wasn't able to get back to it.

any suggestions?

Doris

lisa,

a ~/.forward file contains a comma-separated list of addresses to which 
incoming mails should be redistributed.  if you want to leave a copy on 
your system, use the backslash-prefix:

e.g.: (1)

me@somehwere.else.com, me@over.there.edu

(2)

\mehere, me@somewhere.else.com

hope it helps,

Whoops, he means ls -a. (for hidden files.  -l is for file attributes.)

Use the ";" select command of Pine 3.91.  Make sure it is anabled in
the Setup/Config screen first...

I don't understand.  I highlighted three messages, then searched for the word
"Duplicate", which existed in the text of the second message, but PINE
reported that the text was not found.

yours, then I typed ";ntaDuplicate" and pressed RETURN.  As expected,
the other two messages were de-selected, leaving yours selected...

Ahh, yes.  Very nice.  I hadn't ever tried to "narrow" a selection before.

That's an, uh, interesting method of searching for text...

We experimented with this some time ago and found that even a simple
new-mail indicator was too slow to be worthwhile, at least in our
environment.  We are planning to try again when some of the new IMAP4
features are integrated into Pine though...

    I don't think that Pine has an upper limit.  (If it does, it is 
probably pretty large.)  However, some mail transfer agents, such as some 
versions and/or configurations of Sendmail, may impost a limit in 
practice.

    By default, the .signature file goes in your home directory.  (You 
can get there by the cd command from the shell prompt.)  Just edit it 
like any other text file.  However, the bare ls (list) command does not 
show filenames beginning with a period.  Use ls -l .

    You can put in a request (it's not default.)  Assuming you are using 
Pine 3.91, from the Main Menu go into Setup and Config.  Scroll down to 
customized-headers and add Return-Receipt-To: <your address> .  Of 
course, given the nature of Internet email, this does not guarantee that 
you will get a receipt, as not all receiving systems honor it.

We are running Solaris 2.5 on a Pentium PC.  Does someone have Pine 
compiled to run on the X86 version of Solaris?  

Please reply to kelly@whitman.edu is possible.

TIA

    You're right, of course.  (Slip of the fingers -- and brain.)
Sorry about that.  (I usually use an alias, so I rarely enter ls -a 
and ls -l as such.)

Hi,

For a magazine I've planned to work with a polling-group of about 150 
people. I can put all the e-mail-adresses in one group in the 
adress-book. But if i mail the group, all the e-mail-adresses appear in 
the header of the message. Is there a way to post the whole group without 
the e-mail-adresses in the header? Thanks in advance for your response!

I am running Pine on a standalone Linux machine and want to use it
to read mail on my internet service provider via ppp.  I think I have
the general network things set up since I can connect netscape and
tin.  I am having trouble on getting pine connected though.  I have
tried various combinations in the setup screen but need help to get
the right combination.

I have a problem with the use-current-dir option on my Linux system. When
I load a file (^r in composer) and go to the file list (^t) the systems 
gets locked. I notice high activity on the harddrive that goes on
entirely. Even the mnouse on the X11 Screen does no longer move. I must
reset the pc.

Any suggestion ??

Yes it is!  (At least, it is in the Pine 3.91 kit _i_ pulled from 
ftp.cac.washington.edu some time back!)  There's been an SGI build since 
Pine 3.07.

You want "build sgi".

Cheers,

It is normal. I have had the same problem. To get rid of it make shure,
that option "news-post-without-validation" is set.

Using Pine 3.91, can I specify a list of newsgroups for posting? I'd like 
an abbreviated way of doing this rather than selecting each newsgroup 
each time.

Email appreciated.

Not very coherent from Intellects inc. but here goes:

I suggest you go for a long walk and think of something else,
that way you could achieve to _forget_ the read message,
maybe not as good as unreading it, but it could suffice.

How about something like:

alias from 'from -d $HOME/incoming'
alias fri 'echo "INBOX:";from INBOX | more'
alias frin 'echo `fri | lines` "messages" | grep -v " 0"'

I use that (and a bunch of others for my other incoming folders) to give me
an overview of how many new messages I have each time I log on.

PINE was by far the easiest shareware program I've built for Unix.  I
complied it under SGI IRIX 5.2 with the command below.  The binary works
fine even after upgrading my system to IRIX 5.3.

Build pine with this command:
./build sgi EXTRADRIVERS=mbox

The "EXTRADRIVES=mbox" flag is a special option used at my site.  It says
to copy all new incoming mail from the mail spool/server to a user's
mbox file (INBOX folder) upon invocation of pine.  This frees resources on
the mail spool.  I'd be interested to hear of other obscure compilation
options as well as a better description of this option.

Subject: Running Pine from Gopher
Status: O
X-Status: 
X-Keywords:
X-UID: 109

I am attempting to setup a gopher server to allow access to Pine from the
main Gopher menu.  I have had success using the "exec" type to run scripts
from gopher, for example to display the calendar, but have not had much luck
getting Pine to work from gopher.

When I execute the Pine script from gopher I get the message: "Cannot
connect to host (NULL), port 70.  Hostname is unknown".

The Pine script is named "runpine" and contains:

#!/bin/sh
/usr/bin/pine

The .Link file contains:

Numb=4
Name=Pine e-mail
Path=exec:"":/bin/runpine
Type=0
Port=+
host=+

Is it even possible to have Pine accessable from gopher?  If so, could you
offer some suggestions on how to get it to work?  I would greatly appreciate
any suggestions offered.

As I am not with any Usergroups at this time please direct all responses to
my email address listed below. Thank you.

	I'd be interested in this too.  I read the 3.91 future
improvements section, and I'd really really like a mailer that can
handle pgp enc/dec/signature etc... However, judging by the date on
their ftp archive, pine hasn't been updated in over a year... Is
anyone still developing it?

Does anyone have a list of the supported TERM?  I normally jump between
vt100 and hp (or other TERMS supported by HP).  and Pine doesn't seem to 
be able to recognize keystrokes corectly when I switch to TERM=hp.

oh, BTW, I run this on HP-UX 9.0..  Thanx in advance

We're still working on it, but we got up such a good head of steam
that it's been hard to put the brakes on to get a new release out ;)

At the request of my bosses, I recently did trace exactly such a forgery
to a particular user at our site.  The user has been temporary kicked 
off the system and may be so permanently.  The punishment (not my decision)
may be harsh, but it is not uncommon.

Playing with the from line is not the way to make email/news anonymous.
And even joke forgeries get treated strictly.

I don't think so.  The forger no longer thinks so.

Pegasus mail does.  You get a receipt when the mail is read, although I'm 
not sure if this is purely a pegasus to pegasus thing.

It could mean that you have 2 copies of PINE open, maybe ^Z suspended,
then re-opened by typing 'pine' rather than typing 'fg' to bring the
suspended pine back to the foreground ... Only a thought ... Maybe 
someone else has another idea?  BYE.

Hello!

I am looking for Pine Mail to run on an IBM compatible PC or any other 
solution to archive my emails for future reference. The Pine Mail view 
of emails with date etc. is what I like to keep. Also, I want to avoid to 
extract every single email, that I received or have sent, as it is time 
consuming and I would loose the capability of browsing emails using date 
or subject.

Thank you in advance for any answer.

Heinz-Christian

(How) can I start PINE with the INBOX folder opened immediately, without

Thanks for any tips,

I frequently send e-mail to a distribution list with sixty addresses on 
it. So the first dozen or so lines of the message are taken up with 
addresses.

Is there any way to avoid this clumsiness by just showing the name I have 
given the list in the "To:" line, instead of the whole list?

TIA

Does anybody know how many e-mail Id's can be put on a distribution list
in Pine does it have a limit? Or is the limit up to the Sys Admin?

[This has been asked and answered many times, and so should be in the 
archives of this mailing list: check the Pine Information Centre at 
http://www.cac.washington.edu/ for further information.]

1.  Start composing message.
2.  Put cursor on a header line.
3.  Type ^R (Rich Header).
4.  Put recipient list (or addressbook nickname) in the "Bcc" field.
5.  Fill in the "To" field either with your own e-mail address, or 
    something along the lines of:
		Subscribers:;
6.  Send message.

Recipients will not get the whopping great list of recipients (if their 
mail delivery software is configured properly!)

Note Step 5!  This is to avoid problems with some more demented mail 
delivery programs.

Cheers,

I suspect you're onto a loser here...

Gopher (and the Web) are connectionless protocols (if that's the phrase 
I'm after).  That is, a request comes in, the information is returned, 
and the connection broken.

CGI scripts are programs that are run in response to a request to obtain 
and output (rturn) the information.  They finish and the connection closes.

However Pine is very much an *interactive* program.  It expects you to 
maintain an (interactive) connection and type commands at it to open 
mailboxes, move through lists, etc.  I don't know of any way of getting 
this to work with Gopher/Web servers (though I am willing to be proved 
wrong!).

If you are hoping to get uor mail folder readable on the Web you could 
try looking at a converter tool such as HyperMail.  This makes an 
HTMLified copy of the messages in a mail folder.  However these are 
"read-only" ... you cannot delete them , refile them into other folders, etc.

Cheers,

Mike Brudenell                                         <pmb1@york.ac.uk>

    I use ispell on Amiga Pine.  You can install it as the "Alternative

I'm running pine for os/2 from my pc, and i'm trying to get it to read/
write to folders on my hard drive, in particular reading from an
INBOX.ndx file created with lampop. Is this even possible? If its not,
how do i create savemail, sentmail, etc. folders on my hard drive that pine
will use. I haven't been able to figure out the syntax from the help 
files or any of the documentation that i've found.

Thanks,

I can't remember except that you need to go to Main Menu/Setup/Config and
put your newsfeed name (ie mine is news.psu.edu) into the newsfeed section. 
You have to leave and return I believe.

PS I am using 3.9.1.

I use UNIX Pine for two different accounts. With one of them Pine 
makes full use of the screen but with the other one (my main mail) it 
always uses the same 24x80 screen size even if I make my screen height 
and width larger. Anyone know how I can fix this? Please email me at 
andrews@biology.ucla.edu.

We here at Wilberforce University have an NCR 3000 Unix box running
System V Release 4.  I have tried to build Pine and Pico using the 
build sv4 command but get several error messages:

./osdep.h: 44: Can't find include file stdlib.h
/usr/include/sys/byteorder.h: 110: extra tokens (ignored) after directive
os_sv4.c: 50: Can't find include file regexpr.h
os_sv4.c: 53: Can't find include file shadow.h
*** Error code 1
...
osdep.c: 71: Can't find include file termios.h
*** Error code 1
Stop.
...
./../c-client/osdep.h: 44: Can't find include file stdlib.h
*** Error code 1
Stop.


When I run build -n sv4 I get the following error message at the end:

Make:  Don't know how to make ../pico/libpico.a.  Stop.

Can any of you Pine gurus out there help me?

Hello !

I don't know how to send automatically the files I export from the=20
NewsGroups to a specific directory (i.e. "News").

In the Setup menu, I wrote :

news-collection     =3D News *{news.cict.fr/nntp}[]

but when I "export" a file, it goes to the Home directory, not the News=20
directory...

Can you help me ?

Thanks.

I downloaded pine.tar.Z , uncompressed and un-tarred it.

We have one SCO-Unix box with internet mail accessed via uucp on the

uunet service.  We would like to use pine as an alternative to the

old-fashioned unix mail.  All I want is to compile pine on SCO to get

a similar look & feel as the telnet demo I saw on the internet.

(We don't use tcp/ip presently) How hard would it be to do this?

I tried 'make sco' and various things don't compile.

I have just the auto-move-read-msgs option unchecked and that seems to be
enough.  I can send you my config file (~/.pinerc) if you think it helps.

Our site currently uses both ELM and PINE. Pine appears to be overwelmingly
easier to use and more robust except for spelling. 

Elm can be interfaced to Ispell, but has anyone had experience integrating
Ispell with PINE?

Also, is there a better email spell checker than Ispell?  

thanks muchly,

You can't insert headings directly into a mail message, you can to it by 
adjusting Pine Config.However,that feature is already enabled,so all you 
to do is hit Control-R when in the header of a message you composing,and for
the header line that says "Return-R;" insert your email address.

There are some "config" values that are marked internally as not
being user modifiable. This makes sense but, in my opinion, they
should be modifiable from the global pine.conf.fixed. The patch
is simple:

Thank you for your clear instructions. I couldn't even find Pine in the U 
of W home page. What a jungle!

I haven't tried it yet, but next time I will,

I'm grateful.

Sound like you need a program called procmail.  Pine does not filter mail 
but this program will filter it for you before it gets to pine.

You won't see the file in your directory if you use "ls".  To see the 
files preceeded by a "." you must use "ls -a".  As for the ".signature" 
file it just goes in your home directory.  Hope this is helpful.

    While using Pine for extended periods, I receive this message:

         Unable to create TCP socket: Too many open files

    This occurs when I've opened and closed many newsgroups and sent / 
received several mail messages.  I run Pine 24 hours a day.

    Since AmigaDOS places no limits on the number of open files, I believe
Pine must have a MAX_FILES limit.  Does Pine properly close files streams
that it has opened?  Is this an issue for 3.92?

    If I quit and resume Pine, then all is well.

In order to save having to 'Reply' or 'Forward' to check a signature or
decrypt
a message, I have found that if you enable the pipe '|' command and pipe
the 
message to pgp -f it will check the signature OK.  But, if the message
is 
encrypted it appears as though nothing is happening in pine but pgp is
actually 
prompting you for your passcode.  If you enter it, it works; you then
see all the
dialog that you would normally see when you 'cat filename | pgp -f' as
well 
as the decrypted message.

The question is, why does pine not show the results of the pipe untill
it is 
complete, and can it be made to do so?

I am using mkpgp1.6 to do the signing and decrypting.

Thnx for any responses.

It seems that although the documentation (doc/tech-notes) indicates
that "bugs-address" is read from the system-wide config file, actually
this never takes place anywhere in the Pine source code?

So bug reports are always sent to the compiled-in default address,
never to the one set in the system-wide config file?

I guess I can get around this by compiling in a different default, but
can someone explain this, is it just something that's not implemented
yet, or am I missing something?

	Is there a way in exiting pine that behaves more like elm?
I've unset auto-save-read-msgs (so that messages I've read aren't
automatically moved somewhere and deleted), but if I've read a
message, then type 'q' to quit, the damn thing asks me if I want to
save my read msgs to read-mail... I DON'T.  I just want them to stay
there!  If I wanted them saved, I would have saved them myself.

	When I exit pine I'd like these things to happen: if I've
deleted messages, then delete them without asking (I have that option
set).  If I have messages that are not deleted in my INBOX, I want
them to stay there when I exit regardless of whether or not I've read
them, saved them, laughed at them, or whatever, nor do I want to be
prompted about their disposition.  Why is this so difficult to do?
(Elm does this just fine).

	Any info on how this might be accomplished, would be
appreciated... (Greatly).  Though I suspect the only alternative is to
modify the source, which I can do at home, but not at work...bummer.

I have the same problem (I want my home generated mail messages to have a return address the same as my ISP mail account not my home account) and have partially solved it:

I changed the entries:

"personal-name"

and 

"user-domain"

in my .pinerc file the ISP provided names.  Now my mail messages show up like

From: bmandel <bill@loop.com>
I want it to be:
From: bmandel <bmandel@loop.com>

I guess I can just change my home user account to bmandel, but I would  rather configure pine correctly. Does anyone know of another pine variable like "personal-name" that sets the user name to something else?

Thanks,
Bill Mandel

And it came to pass that after the fulness of time Pine 3.89 gave birth 
to Pine 3.90.  And Pine 3.90 likewise to Pine 3.91.

Yea verily, even now Pine 3.91 is reaching a ripe old age, and looks 
forward to the appearance of its son, Pine 3.92.

Methinks it is time to lay your 3.89 to reat and upgrade?  :-)

Well, assuming you're using Pine (which I assume you are, as you're 
asking the quesion in a mailing list/news group *about* Pine!)...

Pine *should* automatically decode the MIME formatted message when you 
read it (or save it to disk).

However this can sometimes not happen, when the message has been received 
by someone NOT using a MIME-aware mailer, who then forwarded it on to 
you.  The special MIME headers get lost in this process, and Pine doesn't 
realise the message is encoded in Base64 or Quoted-Printable (the usual 
MIME encodings).

In this case you can unpack it by obtaining software such as "munpack".  
(I can't remember sites carrying this off the top of my head).

You can also use this software if you have used some other mailer to read 
the message (although strictly you should have asked elsewhere, in a more 
suitable newsgroup/list :-)

Cheers,

Yes....

1.  UUencode the file.
2.  Start Pine and start composing message.
3.  Put cursor in Message Text area.
4.  Type ^R (Read File).
5.  Enter filename containing the UUencoded data, press Return.

These steps form a general sequence that is used to include text files 
without encoding them using Base64 (files named in the Attachments header 
field are *always* encoded using Base64).

A UUencoded file is just text, and so can be included in this way.

I think you're being bitten by a small bug that was in the Pine 3.91 
source code (and possibly binaries) early on.  I'm *presuming* the 
versions now available have been fixed, but may be wrong.

A small patch was released to fix this problem.  Symptoms included 
various settings not being read from the (systemwide? I forget!) 
configuration file.

Have a check at ftp.cac.washington.edu to see if there's a newer version 
of the source/binary you have, or a separate patch file.  I remember it 
was posted to this list ages ago, but can't recall whether it is also on 
the ftp server (anyone got a moment to check?)

Cheers,

Mike Brudenell                                         <pmb1@york.ac.uk>

        We had that problem here: our bibliographic workstations are 
         all OS/2 machines. It seems that pine prints only to LPT1, 
         and OS/2 defaults to LPT3. So somebody wrote a printer 
         redirector, which takes output from pine and hands it off to 
         an OS/2 printer. One more thing to keep on your desktop, but 
         it works fine.

Hi,
   is there a way to config pine so that each time i do a keyboard lock, 
i don't have to key in the password? ie. i would like to have a fixed

	The standard directions for misc.test.moderated says to test your 
connection by using the follow-up function, not the reply function, on 
the message containing the directions (the welcome message). _Is_ there 
any such distinct function in pine? If I use the reply command, say yes 
to posting, then delete the (apparent) addressee other than the 
newsgroup, will that do it??

Pine 3.92 will be able to do this, assuming you have an 8BITMIME aware
ESMTP server.

This could be implemented as a new mailbox format c-client driver and
could be patterned after any of the "snarfing" drivers (tenex, mtx,
mh, mbox).  The advantage of this is that all the changes are isolated
to the underlying c-client library and don't affect the main Pine
code...

One disadvantage of this is that there would be a noticable delay
every time Pine finds new mail in your system inbox as procmail is
called.  We don't have any near-term plans to implement such a driver,
but would welcome contributions...

Well, that's what we do here, although I wouldn't want to contribute the
changes the way they are currently...  In our distributed mail system, mail
is delivered into users' directories as separate files in their "Mailbox"
and our pine calls out to a program to append the mail to the users pine
inbox (again, in their home directory).  In the current version in
progress, the user can direct this process using procmail.<nl>
<nl>
I have been able to work with what we have now, but I'd like to take the
time perhaps to fix this situation somewhat.  We're not likely to change
the delivery-into-Mailbox behavior any time soon, so the proper things in
c-client would be best.<nl>

Main -> Setup -> Config -> initial-keystroke-list : i

Normally Pine starts with the main-menu. Go from there to Setup and 
select Config. Look for the field "initial-keystroke-list" and set it to "i".

This automatically brings you in the index of your INBOX when Pine comes up.

Message-Id: <4fdi6t$snf@wally.uofport.edu>

I've had some pine 3.91 sessions hanging lately, and in the course of my
investigating, I found that each session of Pine makes a datagram conection
to a different port.  This would be okay except that on occasion, Pine will
bind to a port that is listed in the /etc/services file (which I thought
wouldn't happen) and the pine session will hang, as well as knock out the 
service that was there on that port in the first place.

Does anybody have any reason why Pine needs to bind to a port at all?  This
might really mess things up in the future.  FYI, I'm running Pine 3.91 on 
a SS10 running SunOS 4.1.3_U1, and that same machine is the mail server, so
the connections are internal.

Please help!

I connect via modem to a suns from a pc running linux.  The print to
attached ansi command of Pine does not work.  I have tried using C-kermit,
and minicom as communication software.  I have set minicom to ANSI
terminal.  I have set software flow control on.  I have set "preseve stop
... on".  I have tried each of these things in different combinations. It
has been suggested that if I could modify the command Pine uses to print I
might be able to fix this. ( kermit-C "apc server, remote print xxx
finish"  ) Unfortunatly, I don't think my university system administrator
would be to keen on the idea. Is there anything that I, as a user, can do
to make the print to ansi command work when issuing the command in pine on
the suns while connected via modem from my linux computer.? 
	This has always worked in Dos/Windows.  I would like to know if I 
should give up trying to fix this.  For clarification;  by it does not 
work I mean the text is scrolled on the screen, and does not go to my 
printer.

Thank you

I am trying to restrict access to my /etc/passwd file.  However pine
insists on using it and I therefore have the file readable by the
world.

Does anyone know if this can be restricted so pine can read another
cutdown passwd file or not reference it at all?

Cheers, Andrew.

Has anyone had luck compiling pine 3.91 on Solaris 2.5 (or 2.4)?

We tried several different compiler and OS options, all failing
with the same problem; the compiler complaining of a redefinition
of getopt from the stdlib.h version.

All the other modules (pico, daemons) compiled.  Just pine failed.

Reply via email,
Robert

Help,

We somehow got the permissions on a group of files (including pine) changed.
Pine was installed on our HPUX 800 by someone who is no longer here and I do
not know what the permissions should be, but we are unable to send email out
using pine.  We can look and it and receive it just fine.

Anyone know what files are messed up?  The FAQ does not mention permissions.

TIA

Hi.  I was trying to delete some mail while using PINE the other day (on 
my university's account), but PINE said that it cannot delete the mail 
because the folder was "READ ONLY" (and whenever I open the folder, it 
says "READ ONLY".  How do I bypass this?  Or toggle the readonly off?
thanks

Please try to e-mail me as I don't check the group often.

Someone in our department has been experiencing a strange problem:  the "y"
command sporadically and unpredictably seems to issue a "print screen" command
rather than a "print this message" command.

Has anyone else experienced this?  Any suggestions as to cause or cure?

The ';' command is useful for searching messages, or viewing a subset of
messages via the zoom command.  Unfortunately, zoom seems to be the only
command that can take advantage of aggregates.  It would nice to be able
to use aggregates in a manner analogous to elm's tagging feature.

My favourite use would be to save multiple messages to the same folder.

What chance of seeing this in a future version of pine?

ps  Speaking of future versions of pine, when will they take their bows?

If you're trying to say "Can you make Pine think you haven't read a message?"
the answer is "yes."  Use the "*" command followed by "n" to flag the message 
as "new."

You don't need to wait for a future version: The "A" / Apply command,
followed by another command key ( like 'S'ave, for instance ) will
do what you want - i.e. apply the command to the entire selected set
of messages.

Is it possible to send (setup) an automatic reply via Pine?
If yes, how?

I run a mailing list for my wife, and currently we have 323 users, set in
groups of 50 in each group that gets mailed out. What my problem is, that
some of the users have been having trouble receiving the mailing, which
can vary from 3k to 30k in size. I attach a "header" to the top, like in a
digest format on a listserve mailing list, saying the membership total,
date, amount of messages and total lines in the message. When I send it, I
send it to myself and bcc it to each group. 

The problem is some users have recently been only receiving the first 13
lines(the header) and nothing else, however, when I forward it to them
after they contact me saying they didn't receive it, then they get the
entire thing. 

Thats one problem i am having, the 2nd problem is 1 of my users is,
depending on the messages, getting each individual message, even though it
is sent in digest format to her. So, the example would be, if there were 5
messages in this digest, she would get the header(first 13 lines), then
the 5 messages in 5 different letters from me. 

I have been doing this since June of last year with no troubles, and no 
troubles except the occasional bounce from users losing their access, 
but, otherwise, no troubles until recently(within the last month).

Can anyone make any sugggestions on the 2 above problems? Any help would 
be appreciated. BTW, nothing new, as far as I know has been done to the 
ISP I get access through, and send the mail through.

I suspect the problem involves your Mail Transport Agent (e.g. sendmail)
rather than pine.

I see 3 MX records for the host in your return address:

okway.okstate.edu mail is handled by osuunx.ucc.okstate.edu
okway.okstate.edu mail is handled by bubba.ucc.okstate.edu
okway.okstate.edu mail is handled by okway.okstate.edu

Performing an SMTP expand command at each yields, respectively

250 <doctore@okway.okstate.edu>
250 <doctore@okway.okstate.edu>
550 doctore@okway.okstate.edu not a local mailing list

Thus, messages for you appear to be directed to the third host which
fumbles them.

Hope this helps,

I use Pine to send to a list of 300+ people, and when I send it out I use 
Blind Carbon Copy(bcc), you need to enable this in the setup of Pine. 
There is a button to turn it on and off, and after it is enabled, you hit 
CTRL-R to activate it. Though, I have found that over 50 people ona  list 
is max our pine goes, so, I have 7 lists I send our each time I mail to 
them. I am not sure if it is Pine, or our server that prevents us from 
mailing to more then 50 at a time.
Good luck

          Dear Madam or Sir,


I tried to compile pine. Build script showed me information, that I should
find doc/pine-ports file and choose platform.

First question: where is this file?

Second: could you advise me, what command should I execute, to compile Pine and
Pico. I use Unix Solaris 2.4 x86.

                                                Sincerely Yours,
                                                Krzysztof Czuma

I'm afraid there is no simple way built into pine. You must use 
another program to 'filter' your mail.

Here is the URL of the FAQ on how to filter your mail.

Good luck,

Peter

    If you are using Pine under Unix and have the program sz available, 
browse my home page for a technique to download directly from Pine's 
display of a message via Procomm Plus to your PC.  In my case I have PC+ 
configured so that it goes to a RAM-disk, which I could then copy to a 
floppy if I wanted.  (I could also reconfigure PC+ to download directly 
to a floppy drive.)

	I have also sporadically expeienced this problem. Do you use a 
telnet type setup?  If so, check your session and global settings.
	The most probably reason is that it CANNOT find the printer 
command.  Make sure that you can print from that same terminal.

	By the way, when I use a regular terminal program, it never 
prints out to my printer.  I have also had to use a telnet entry program.

	It is already available in the current (3.91) version.  It is called
"a" or "apply".  After the "a" command you tell it what to apply to the
messages which have been ";" tagged.

I use pico as my editor.  I want to set my right margin
to 64 characters for CNTL-J justification, but am unable 
to locate any instructions as to how to do so.

Any help will be appreciated.

I'm using Pico in Pine and also in the shell at the command prompt...

The command 'set mark' [control-^], stopped working for me. 

'set mark' now requires [escape-escape-^].

How can I reset the command back to [control-^], which should be the default?

For the last couple of days, I've been using Pine to read news.  I've 
notice that articles are flagged with the "N" to indicate that they're 
new articles.  Once opened and read, this flag is removed.  If I open 
another folder for news a come back, these same articles are listed with 
the new flag.

The only way I've found to really mark them as read (and remove them 
permanently) is to do a ";aad" to delete them.  Is there something that 
I'm missing?  Is there any easier way to accomplish this?

Thanks,
Ray

If you're using linux, this is probably because /usr/bin/spell is a
link to ispell.  Make /usr/bin/spell be the following file instead:


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
#! /bin/sh
#
# A front-end to ispell which allows it to act like the "spell" program
# By: Christopher Neufeld <neufeld@caliban.physics.utoronto.ca>
#

case $# in
        0)      ispell -l | sort | uniq ;;
        *)      cat $@ | ispell -l | sort | uniq ;;
esac
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This will make the command "spell" behave like the typical unix spell 
command.

To actually use ispell with its list of suggested words, you can make 
ispell the alternate editor by adding the following to your .pinerc:

editor=/usr/bin/ispell -x

Hope that helps.

Can someone tell me if there is a keystroke in Pine to jump to
the beginning or end of a message.  Many times I am quoting
from another large document and would like to use just one
sentence and discard the rest.
 
Having a command to jump to beginning and end of document would
surely be useful.

Catalogue Format Options:
1.  19-Part email- can be read by EVERYONE (~525 K Total).
2.  For more advanced computer users:  attached text file ~525K - you
     must know how to download an attached text file and then be able to

     special expansion software or knowledge of Stuffit (tm) needed.  You
     just double-click on the file icon and it automatically expands
     (unstuffs). This is for more advanced mac computer users only, as
     you still have to know how to deal with an attached file.  It will cut
     your download time by 75%.   Expands out to the same ~525K file in
     option #2.  See option #2 for more info on what you will need to be
     able to do.
4.  For expert computer users: compressed attached text file, created with

     has expansion software to decompress (expand) Stuffit(tm) (.sit) files.
     This is for more advanced computer users only and will cut your

     #2.  See option #2 for more info on what you will need to be able to do.



Hi fellow 'netters,

My name is Melanie Tsai and I recently started using a magazine
subscription club in the USA that has a FREE 1 yr. magazine subscription
deal with your first paid order- and I have been very pleased with them.
They have over 1,500 different USA titles that they can ship to any country
on a subscription basis.   As for computer magazines from the USA, they
more of a selection than I ever knew even existed.  They have magazines for
most every area of interest in their list of 1,500 titles.

Within the USA, for their USA members, they are cheaper than all their
competitors and even the publishers themselves.  This is their price
guarantee.

Overseas, on the average, they are generally around one-fourth to one-half
of what the newsstands overseas charge locally for USA magazines.  On some
titles they are as little as one-tenth of what the newsstands charge.  They
feel that mgazines should not be a luxury overseas.   In the USA, people
buy magazines and then toss them after reading them for just a few minutes
or hours.  They are so cheap in the USA!   Well, this company would like to
make it the same way for their overseas members.  They are also cheaper
than all their competitors in the USA and overseas, including the
publishers themselves!   This is their price guarantee.  Around one-half
their business comes from overseas, so they are very patient with new
members who only speak limited English as a 2nd language.

Their prices are so cheap because they deal direct with each publisher and
cut-out all the middlemen.

They will send you their DELUXE EMAIL CATALOGUE (around 525K-big and
juicey) !)...if you completely fill out the form above.  It has lists of
all the freebies, lists of all the titles they sell, titles broken down by
categories and detailed descriptions on nearly 1,200 of the titles that
they sell.

Please do not email me as I am just a happy customer and a *busy* student.
I don't have time to even complete my thesis in time, let alone run my
part-time software business!  Please fill out the above form and carefully
follow the intructions above to get it to them via fax or smail.

They guarantee to beat all their competitors' prices. Sometimes they are
less than half of the next best deal I have been able to find and other
times, just a little cheaper - but I have never found a lower rate yet.
They assured me that if I ever do, they will beat it.

They have been very helpful and helped me with all my address changes as I
haved moved from one country to another.

They have a deal where you can get a free 1 yr. sub to a new magazine from
a special list of over 295 popular titles published in the USA.   They will
give you this free 1 yr. sub when you place your first paid order with them
to a renewal or new subscription to any of the over 1,500 different popular
USA titles they sell.

They can arrange delivery to virtually any country and I think they have
clients in around 45 or 46 countries now.  Outside the USA there is a
charge for FPH (foreign postage and handling) (on both paid and freebie
subs) that varies from magazine to magazine.  I have found their staff to
be very friendly and courteous.  They even helped me with an address change
when I moved from one country to another.

The owner thinks of his service as a "club" and his clients as "members"
(even though there is no extra fee to become a member - your first purchase
automatically makes you a member) and he is real picky about who he accepts
as a new member.   When he sets you up as a new member, he himself calls
you personally on the phone to explain how he works his deal, or sometimes
he has one of his assistants call.  He is kind of quirky sometimes - he
insists on setting up new members by phone so he can say hi to everyone (I
sure wouldn't want to have his phone bills!),  but you can place future
orders (after your first order) via E-mail.

He has some really friendly young ladies working for him, who seem to know
just as much as he does about this magazine stuff.  If you live overseas,
he will even call you there, as long as you are interested, but I think he
still makes all his overseas calls on the weekends, I guess cause the long
distance rates are cheaper then.

He only likes to take new members from referrals from satisfied existing
members and he does virtually no advertising.  When I got set-up, they had
a 2-3 week waiting list for new members to be called back so that they
could join up. (Once you are an existing member, they help you immediately
when you call. )  I think they are able to get back to prospective new
members  the same day or within a few days now, as they have increased
their staff.  I am not sure about this.........but if you email the above
form to them, that is the way to get started!

They will send you their DELUXE EMAIL CATALOGUE (around 525K-big and
juicey) !)...if you completely fill out the form above.  It has lists of
all the freebies, lists of all the titles they sell, titles broken down by
categories and detailed descriptions on nearly 1,200 of the titles that
they sell.

They then send you email  that outlines how his club works and the list of
free choices that you can choose from, as well as the entire list of what
he sells;  and then they will give you a quick (3-5 minute) friendly,
no-pressure no-obligation call to explain everything to you personally and
answer all your questions.

Once you get in, you'll love them. I do.


Sincerely,

Melanie Tsai


ps.  please forward a copy of this message to all your friends on the net
who you think might be interested in it!  It is a great deal!  If you join
and then they join after you, you will earn a free 1 yr. subscription for
each new person you get to join after you join!   If you exceed 25
referrals, they let you use them to give away as gifts, for Christmas,
Chanukah or any other occasion.  Please be kind enough to mention my name
when you join.   I will then get a free magazine for a year for referring
you.
Thank you.

Hi, list!

The question: I have set Pine 3.91 to save sent messages by recipient. It 
works O.K. except when there is no To: line (it happens). Most annoying 
is the case of news posting. I don't then see Fcc header when composing, 
but if I hit ^R, I suddenly discovered that all news posting are saved in 
sent-mail folder. Pine makes it silently without even inform me about it.

Is it possible to supress it? I don't normally save EVERY mail or news I 
send. 

thanks in advance

Hi, folks!

I currently try to configure PGP support from out of mail reader (Pine
3.91) using .mailcap. At first attempt to request public key form
key-server I got message of type: 

application/pgp ; format=keys-only

The question is: where can I find info on application/pgp type to be able to
proper configure .mailcap.

I would prefer some sort of mail based archive server as I have problems 
with on-line connection.

I would appreciate your copy of posting direct to me.

much thanks in advance

I am using HyperTerminal on Win95 to connect to a Unix server and use 
Pine.  The Print to ANSI does not work.  The computer just hangs.  I know 
that the option works OK as I have used it on other computers (under Win 
3.1 and on Macs).

Thanks for any help!

I didn't see an answer to your question, so here goes. Distribution lists 
are done in the Address Book. Select Address Book from the main menu and 
then press "S," Create List.

I'm new, brand spanking new actually. I run a small mailing list(about 
325 members) for my wife. We're having trouble using PIne sending out 
the "digest" formats. Pine is sending the first 13 lines of it, adn then 
no more. But, heres a little background on what we are doing.
People send me mail, I export it to a file on my home directory, download 
it, and edit it(somewhat), attach the "header"(header is a 13 line ASCII 
that gives the name of the list, membership total, date, amount of 
messages and total amount of lines that are in that digest. I upload it 
back online(I use a PC, adn my ISP is a UNIX based), and then I compose, 
CTRL-R for rich header, add my email address to the top,a dn the first 
group of 50 names in BCC. I add a subject, usually the name of the list 
and a date, and then read the file I uploaded back online adn send it off.
What some members are getting are only the first 13 lines, adn nothing else.
Does anyone have any clues for me?

I don't know but I just had the same problem for two days. When I sent an 
email to my service provider (Balt. Co. Pub. Lib.) they said that pine 
was closing, but was still thinking it was open or something like that 
and that they corrected the problem from their end. But this brings me to 
my question. Sometimes when I open Pine and go to the INBOX and then 
later press L to get to the folders it seems to get hung up and stay hung 
for a long time. I can't wait forever and hope that it will unhang itself 
so I just turn off my modem and redial (I usually give it a good four or 
five minutes before I do this). Am I doing something wrong? Or can I do 
something different when this happens. Did I contribute to putting myself 
into that READ ONLY problem? Anyway??????? Thanks, Joseph

Greetings:

Following are suggestions for a future version of Pine.

1.  Autodowload feature in Pine allowing one the option to send message 
and attachments to one's own computer/disk via a protocol like ZModem or 
Kermit.

2.  The ability to also print stuff from the stand-alone Pico editor 
without having to mail files to oneself and printing out of pine. :)

3.  Either a better spell checker, or the option to link the Pine and 
Pico editor to a better spell checker from the user point of view.

Many thanks

Hi
I can not post new posting in Pine for OS2 Warp.
When I try to Post NEW posting it seems that it is trying
to get news group and exits with a message that there is
an error in Pine.

But I thougth I got it working before.
It could be first version. Or there is something wrong
with my Pine setup.
Any idea?
Thanks
bob

    Sure.  If nothing else, do what I do: UUENCODE the file separately 
and then include it in an email with Ctrl-R in the Pine composer.  It 
will be part of the message body itself rather than an attachment.

I have a problem with pine I hope someone can help me with.  When I try to 
spell check a document I get this whole list of options that appear in the
text of my letter.  I think this is a problem with pico.  Can anyone help
configure this properly?

We're running VMS PINE.

It seems that the wastebasket is not expunged automatically on
exiting Pine, but you must go to the folder first then exit.
Doing this, you will be promted to expunge the wastebasket.

I looked in setup but did not see a setting for auto-purge.
Is it possible? or do we have to "manually" expunge
the wastebasket?

Thanks for any suggestions,

Thanks for your help on: "no routing to folders available in Pine"

Is it possible to transfer a file from the INBOX directly to my PC 
without having to go through the UNIX environment from where I use Pine?

I can print the files into my local printer but when I try to transfer 
them Pine sends them to the UNIX file area rather than to my local PC.

Appreciate your help!!!

I must admit, it is probably time for a release of some sort. Most at 
cac.washington.edu seem to already be using pine3.92 in whatever form it 
may happen to be in. Keep up the good work.

Thank you for the FAQ, however my 2 questions were not answered
1. How does one copy multiple names from an address book at one time?
2. How does one delete multiple newsgroup answers at one time.  When you
subscribe, you often have 1000+ messages.

Hello,

I have a question maybe someone can answer regarding Unix Pine 3.91 being 
used in "read-only" mode.  I sent this to "Bug Reports" via the "B" option
within Pine, but the mail was returned undeliverable. (??)

I'm wondering if it was it a design decision, or a bug, to NOT allow new mail
to arrive in Pine when using "pine -o" (read-only) mode?  The current behavior
is inconvenient because I have to EXIT Pine and re-enter it in order to check
for any newly arrived messages.  In case you're wondering, it seems to work
fine starting Pine without the "-o" option, but then it has the ability to
modify my INBOX, which I'd rather avoid.

I use a POP mail reader over a dial-up connection as my primary reader, but
constantly telnet in to my account from work during the day to check my mail,
and I use Pine.  So, I use "read-only" mode so that everything will appear on
my POP mailreader at night.  The problem is, I have to keep exiting and
re-starting Pine all day in order to recieve new messages.

I'd like to see the INBOX be "read-only" but still allow new mail to be 
received and displayed when in "read-only" mode.  Is this a possible bug 
fix, or future enhancement (depending on how it was meant to work)?

Anyone have any suggestions?  Is it just me?

Thanks for your time,

Dennis Price

Well, one possible cause of this would be that Pine was started up in
"read-only" mode.  In the Unix version, this is done with "pine -o".  

Just an idea...

David,

I moderate a newsgroup (misc.taxes.moderated) and use PICO
as my editor under ELM.  My problem is very simple.  I want
to edit initial posts and followup comments so that their
line length at time of posting is 64 characters.

Two reasons: (1) some posters (AOL in particular) have no
concept of line length and (2) from where the right margin
is now set, it is easy to wrap lines when quoting a second
or third time.

Also is there a way to go to the top and/or the bottom of
a file.

Terrific editor!!!  Especially like the CNTL-K cut and copy
function and the CNTL-U recover from ill-considered justification.

BTW: My ISP has PICO 2.5

    Is there a way to collapse the Address book without jumping to Main 
and returning?

    Just one of those little things.

Yes there is!

how can someone be getting special characters (code 224 and up)
into the pine subject line? does that mean someone is doing serious
hacking (and possibly messing with security)? or is it simple?

You need the later pine391a.zip version that fixes the

Thanks - 'stty rows nn' made pine work use my full screen. My only 
remaining question is how to set this up automatically!

   I know you guys have probably had a few people ask this question 
already, so please forgive the redundancy.
   I use Pine at my work. It works fine for E-mail, but the server here 
doesn't get any newsgroups. I have an account at a university server 
which does have newsgroups, but it's awkward to telnet there and use 
their Pine. I tried setting the "nntp-server" with the server address, 
the same I have Netscape set to when I'm using it to get news (but I use 
Netscape through a PPP connection to the University server, so I'm 
already logged on), and it tells me "invalid remote specification". This 
makes a certain amount of sense, because I need a login name and a 
password to get to my university account, and I haven't told Pine what 
those are. 
   How do I configure this? I have a hunch it has something to do with 
the "news-collections" setting, which I haven't messed with. Can anyone help?
Please respond to me personally, because I don't subscribe to this 
mailing list.

Hi everyone,

I can filter my incoming mail to different folders but would like to 
bounce all mail not for my IDs back with a note. Could someone enlighten 
me on how I can do that in Procmail or point me to a FAQ on the subject ?

thanks,
raj

 I have PINE 3.91 , and I was wondering if there were any security
concerns when making Pine available to users? I have placed it in
usr/local/bin and now all the users on the system are able to use it.
Should I be wary of any holes that exist in PINE? set permissions
on PINE and things like that?

Ahyhow thanks...

I run it on the following os/es

Solaris 2.5
Dynix/pTX 2.1.1 (Sequent)
and SunOS 4.1.4

Other than that I love pine...its very good for email, better than
elm thats for sure.

This will be available in Unix Pine 3.92.  Presumably it will be
included in PMDF Pine 3.92, but you'll have to consult Innosoft about
that...

Pine simply uses the nomenclature "Reply" where dedicated news reader
program use "follow-up".  (This is to keep a common realm of concepts for 
e-mail and News within Pine -- one "replies to" an e-mail, not 
"follows-up to" it)  So doing the steps you suggest should indeed work. 

Cheers,

I would like to subscribe to this mailing list, if there is a mailing 
list available for this news group.  I don't get the chance to monitor 
the news group enough and need to follow threads, etc.  I would also be 
interested in hearing from anyone who knows of a way to filter news.  I 
remember a thread not too long ago about how rude it is to post to a news 
group and ask for an e-mail reply.  Someone in that argument mentioned 
subscribing to news groups noninteractively and filtering the news.  This 
would be ideal.  Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.  E-mail 
responses are of course welcome, but I will try like hell to monitor this 
news group closely over the next week or so as well.

Thanks in advance.

I have a BSDi 2.0 unix platform on a pentium which used to run Pine perfectly. 
Recently, something changed and now whenever a user accesses Pine it will only 
come up in readonly mode.  I imagine this must be a rights thing but I have no 
idea where the rights have be screwed up.  BTW, pop3 access works perfectly.

I just compiled pine under NetBSD 1.1/i386.  When I try to start it I get 
this message:

"Can't access terminal or input is not a terminal.  Redirection of 
standard input is not allowed.  For example "pine < file" doesn't work."

I get this message both when logging on directly at my PC, where 
TERM=pc3, and via telnet where TERM=vt100.

pico will start but behaves quite strangely; in particular the arrow keys 
don't work right.

I must be doing something stupid.  Can anyone tell me what it is?

If the nntp-server that provides you with news is not defined
you can define it in your .pinerc-file.

Leave subject blank.

In body of message put:   subscribe pine-info

Send it away!

If you want to get off the list, same address, substitute unsubscribe for 
subscribe in the body.  Few things more annoying than watching people 
send subscribe and unsubscribe requests to the list at large instead of 
the list management program.

John,
	Once you have marked the messages as deleted, if you press "X" 
Pine will ask you if you want to expunge messages?  Press "Y" and this 
will delete the marked messages without exiting the program.

Yes... the "X" (eXpunge) command.

No, it is not possible to do this.  Pine (and other mail reader programs 
such as Elm) read mail *after* it has been delivered to you.

You will need to persuade the mail delivery system to feed newly arriving 
messages for you through some sort of program which looks at their 
content and decide where to file the message.

The persuasion is typically done (on UNIX systems) by creating a file 
called ".forward" in your home directory.  See the manual page on 
sendmail for more information.

The filtering program is typically "filter" or "procmail" -- rarely 
standard utilities on UNIX systems.  Ask your local help desk if either 
are available on your machines.

(Whilst you're there, you could ask them to show you how to use them too! :-)

This is because the current version of Pine (3.91) does not support 
authentication to News servers.

You need to create a file in your home directory called ".signature".  
The contents of this text file should be what you would like you 
signature to look like.  To create this file type "pico .signature" at 
your shell prompt.

Hope this is helpful.

I am new to this list and am sorry if this question has been answered 
already.

Can I get pine info messages in the digest form? The information message
which came alongwith the subscription confirmation is quite on this point.

Thanks in advance

You can create an ascii file with whatever details you need and upload it
into your machine. After that rename that file to .signature.  You can 
ask pine to append your signature automatically by changing the setup to
append signature at the bottom. (That is what pine has done for my
signature :->)

I am really sorry, because this question was discussed here already, but 
I missed the answer (if any); I cannot RTFM as I curently have no on-line 
connection.

I have a friend whom I try to persuade to use Pine. It will be used by 
about 250 - 300 users (if at all). The problem is, most of them are 
connected through dial-up lines. Currently they use UUPC to send/receive 
mail, but it could be easily switched to use dial-on-demand TCP/IP over 
FTP PC/TCP or Novell Lan WorkPlace.

They will in any case wait for Pine 3.92 (because 3.91 lacks some crucial 
features) but to make decision:

1. will it be possible in 3.92 to use off-line mode, that is, preload 
mail from server using POP/IMAP/??? to local PC?

2. will it be possible to use, er, "batch" sending (much the way Pegasus 
Mail does), that is, while in Pine session, accumulate sent mails and 
then send them at once?

3. probably some other features which in effect are equivalent to ones 
above?

Could anybody shed a light on this? 

much thanks in advance

Andrej,
Alas, offline support didn't make it into the cut for 3.92 (which really
is coming Real Soon Now), but "offline" is still planned for later this
year.

I'm new to pine.  I'm running pine from a dial up connection to a unix 
machine.  Twice when I have pushed 'L' to list the folders has pine 
actually listed all of my folders.  Usually, however, it only lists my 
INBOX and nothing else.  I have to memorize the names of my folders if I 
want to open them.  Anyone know why this is happening?

Does anyone know how to send an attachment from Pine so that it shows
up in a CC:Mail user's mailbox as an attachment. Unfortunately,
brain-dead CC:Mail doesn't understand standard MIME attachments.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

I thought of these first, but why does it only happen when I'm
telnetted (or sshd) into this box from *one* particular machine?

Hint: The *one* machine I telnet into from is a LINUX box via pppd.
Usually I'm telnetted/sshd in via normal Ethernet and all is
fine (both DEC servers). Could this behaviour be due to:
	- differences in termcap/terminfo?
	- differences in X-handling?
	- other diffs between DEC Unix and LINUX?

I should try an extended telnet/pine session from an ethernet-connected
LINUX box, and maybe one w/o X. I'll let you know. 

But before that: Is there any other way of tracingthese things (besides
recompiling with -g etc)? DEC Unix does not have truss or so :-(

Mathias

Any hint of what these other mightbe?

How do I flag a mail so that it would let me know when the other person 
has received it and/or read it?  The latest FAQ does not have answer to 
this query.

All info appreciated.

Ciao,

KD

In your Setup/Config, under Customized Headers, put the line:
	return-receipt-to: <your_email_here>

Note that this will only give you an indication if it was delivered 
successfully or not.. however, with some mail programs, it may also 
generate a response once the other person reads your mail.. 

Hope that helps.

	I sent this to 'pine@cac.washington.edu'.  I was wondering if 
anyone else has seen this problem.

Subject: PC-pine & Windows for workgroups

Pine-meisters,

	We have un*x pine & imapd & ipopd running here (William Paterson 
College) - I installed all of that myself.  We're also trying to use 
PC-pine (on wfw machines running MS tcp/ip), but are running into some 
problems.  The strange thing of it is, is that when I connect from my NT
3.51 box, I have no problems at all.  I suspect some sort of 
incompatibility w/ wfw's tcp/ip.  (I am able to telnet to the server 
without problems).

	Here are the errors I'm getting.

At first everything looks fine - I log in to pc-pine and get:
"Folder "INBOX" opened with 1 message"

If I then hit 'l' I get:
"[Can't connect to frontier.wilpaterson.edu,119: Refused (10061)]"

If I highlight INBOX and hit enter everything looks fine (shows the headers).

If I then hightlight one of the messages and hit enter i get:
"[[CLOSED] IMAP connection broken (command)]"
followed closely by:
"[[CLOSED] No-op dead stream]

and then it 'dings' (default windoze sound) repeatedly.

when I then hit 'q' to quit it will ding so I hit 'q' repetedly until the 
"do you really want to quit?" line comes up and then hit 'y' to which it 
says 'ding' (...we are the Knights who say 'ding'! - oh, sorry, Monty 
Python flashback) so I repeatedly hit 'y' until it quits.

Any ideas on what's gone loopy?

I am working on an application and would like to be able to send and read 
information from the PINE program and external programs on an MS-DOS 
platform.  Are there any API's available to do this??  Does anyone have 
any experience doing this with PINE??

In order to try to solve the problem of pine's print to ansii command not
working, when connected to Pine on the Suns via modem using Ckermit in
linux, I am reconfiguring the print command.  This is option three in the
printer configuration.  I would like print to execute a small script. 
Something like
	cp (message) ~/tmp/(message)
	kermit -C "apc server, remote print (message), finish"
	rm   ~/tmp/(message)


This particular one may not work, but that is the general idea.   I 
cannot use (message).  What does pine call the message that has been 
selected for printing? 

Can anyone see any problem with this plan, or suggest an alternative method?

Thank you

 ELM versus PINE that is thee question...

 At the company I work at there is some discussion on which
is better and for what reason...I was wondering if anyone
had any opinions to share to this?  I am currently using
pine3.91 on several flavours of unix, must say it is quite
nice, simple and gets the jobby-job done. ALthough some think
that elm is better at supporting pgp and so on...

whats the word on the street?

thanks

Recently I often get the message
	"maibox format invalidated"
or
	"Access error" or similar in pine 3.91 on a DEC Alpha DU3.2c

This only seems to happen when I telnet in from one particular
remote machine and then run pine. (the box is my home-Linux box)>

Is there any way I can set up a debugging flag to trace this? What
could trigger this problem?

regards
Mathias

Pico appears to be aware of a "right margin" when you justify a 
paragraph using CNTL-J.  It's the right margin for justification
that I want to adjust.

  Alternative naming -- use ``my-print.$$'' -- $$ will be replaced by the=
=20
pid of your script process thus making the name unique. Maybe add ``#!=20
/bin/sh'' or something similar as the first line of the script.

  But as the suggestion for the Pine development team, it would be nice to
have some temporary file name substitution in commands started by pine ...=
=20

        Wastebasket? Wastebasket?? You mean if I expunge something 
         from a folder and then discover I shouldn't've, there's a way
         to recover?? That's what my old internal mailer has always 
         had, but I can't find anything of the sort in pine .... :-(

Does anyone know how to make the text blink in pine?  I've seen a  few 
messages now where the text is blinking and I would like to know how to 
do it.

    I can't help you but it would be nice if Pine had a Rexx interface to 
meet your needs.  Rexx is an inter-program message system built on an 
easy to use interactive language.  It's great for gluing applications 
together and it also very good at text processing.

    Rexx is available for PC-DOS 7, OS/2, AmigaDOS and other operating
systems.

Pine is designed to run without any special privileges.  If Pine is not
installed with any setuid/setgid privileges, then it's just an ordinary
program.  If your users have a C compiler they can build a private copy of
Pine for themselves.

One thing that you need to be careful on is the protection of
/usr/spool/mail (or /var/mail if that's what your system uses).  This
directory should be protected for public write with the "sticky" bit set
(chmod protection 1777).  This is necessary in order to permit Pine to
lock mail files when it is reading or writing; otherwise sendmail and Pine
can trip over each other.

Some sites protect the directory 775 and give mail programs setgid access
to group "mail"  instead.  Pine is not designed to run securely in this
mode.

I read your other message, apologizing for not offering to post a summary.

The answer is "it depends".  What OS?  What shell?

The easiest way to find out how many lines is with resize.  The trick is
getting the LINES and COLUMNS set in stty.  On SunOS 4.x, 'eval `resize`'
would set the values in stty.  Since I have switched to Solaris 2.3 or so, I
have found that it is much trickier.  There are all the standard problems of
setting an environment variable in the current shell, that is what eval is
for.  You will have to read the manpages for stty, eval, and resize, and
experiment.

"Mailbox format invalidated" occurs when Pine detects that new data has
been appended to the mail file, but that new data does not immediately
start with a "start of message" indicator.

This problem is almost always caused by one of two things:
	1) you ran more than one copy of Pine simultaneously and system
	   call locking (flock() or fcntl()) failed to prevent it; this
	   happens most frequently when accessing the file via NFS.
	2) Pine does not have write-access to /usr/spool/mail (or wherever
	   the mail file is located) and thus is unable to create .lock
	   files.  This would permit Pine and sendmail to trip on each
	   other.  This happens when the protection of the directory is
	   something other than 1777.

There are other potential causes, but check these first.

I had a user ask me if he could read/write to the folders in
the directory where he started pine, like elm does (never tired it?).

He apparently has many folders orgainized the way elm makes you
do things.

We're running Solaris 2.3, if that helps.

please respond to my email address if you can (as well as post),

thanks,

Hi! I was hoping someone could tell me how I could specify where incoming mail
folders go, other than $HOME. I'm going to be using procmail to sort my mail,
and would love the incoming stuff to go elsewhere, in hopes of trying to keep
$HOME somewhat clean. :) Also, mail that doesn't go into other incoming
folders will stay in my mail queue. Thanks, in advance! :)

I think you (w_slone) may have over reacted.  (A very abbreviated
summation of the original message is below for those who may have missed
it)

For all we know, the person who asked merely wanted to
send anonymous postings (for which the correct response would
have been to point him to information about anonymous remailers).

Before going over someone's head it is best to try to contact them
directly.  You don't know what purpose he has for his questions.
Warn him that forging is not something taken likely, but spreading
your accusation all over the net is probably inappropriate.

[And lots more like it]

As I have been trying to say, cross-posting a call to smear across
many groups is an over reaction, and under certain circumstances may be
as or more destructive than an individual forgery.  It's better
to keep cool about these things, so that we can deal with the
genuinely destructive cases as they happen.

Regarding Pine version 3.91:

I have a problem with pine that we have not been able to
explain due to network traffic, machine loads or size
of mail file.  During the day I periodically get a lock up
or freeze of pine which I can not associate with any command
usage or event.  The next few command keys I type are kept in the
input buffer and processed after 2 minutes have elapsed.
The problem happens regardless of how many users or load factors are
on the systems involved.  Examples of times when the freeze occurs:
returning to the index from within a message, moving down or
up one message while in the index, typing return to see a message,
and moving up or down one message while viewing a message.

My mailbox is typically about 4 MB in size, with around 1000 or
more messages kept.

Does anyone have any knowledge of this problem or suggestions
on what to check?

Yes... use the Sort command ($) when viewing the newsgroup's index.  This 
will then offer you a number of ways of ordering the messages.  "O" 
(Ordered Subject) is best: primary sort key is subject, secondary key is 
date.

Cheers,

    Pine by itself will not do this.  You have to use some sort of 
program which will process the mail _before_ Pine gets hold of it.  On 
Unix type systems, procmail and filter are two of the more common 
pre-processors.  If you are on a Unix type system and have a WWW browser, 
browse my home page and follow the link to Nancy McGouch's pages for 
information on mail filtering.  (You will have to follow several links to 
get there.)

    This is actually not a very good idea.  It depends on the hardware 
setup of the message recipient's terminal.  On some terminals the message 
will blink (or appear in color, or whatever), but on other terminals it 
will just make a mess.  There are no standards, and it's really not very 
polite to those whose terminals cannot handle it.

Something to try:  make sure you set enable-mail-check-cue
then observe whether the freezes correspond to two asterisks showing up in
the upper-left-corner of the window.  The asterisks indicate that pine is
checkpointing any state changes made to the mailbox; i.e., re-writing it.

That wouldn't explain why it takes so long, but might help identify where
to look further...

ELM looks for a Status line in headers and if it exists it looks at the values.
Whenever it leaves a folder it will update the folder by writing to it.

>I open my mailbox, it remains there?

Just leave the mailbox without updating it, ie don't use "$" to update,
do not change the folder and leave ELM with "X".

NOTE:  I made these statements from experience.
       The code might do a lot more stuff which I probably don't want to know.

However documented - don't use it!  It's bad enough with 8bit chars already.
PC folks keep drawing boxes around their signatures with 8bit characters.
And please note that we already have a shortage on asterisks on Usenet.

Hi - I believe you've guessed the right answer - Reply (in a newsgroup) 
in PINE works like 'followup' in many newsreaders, e.g. TIN - the message 
you are asking about wrongly assumed that the 'followup' terminology is 
universal.

Also, at least in my version (PINE 3.91, Solaris), Reply -ing, then 
selecting 'Post to news group = Y, Reply to all recipients (if asked) = N'
has the effect of only posting; you probably don't need to manually 
delete any other addresses.

For background: 'followup' in many newsreaders means: post under current 
subject, with Re: added, whereas (in those programs) 'reply' means 'reply 
not to newsgroup but to author via e-mail' - similarly, for them, 'post' 
means 'post as new subject'; in PINE, that is simply Compose/send (Ctrl-X).

I hope this helps.

Hi

I don't think Sven's comments on this attribute are valid.  It's an 
*excellent* idea (sorry to take up 8bit chars with the "*" emphasises, Sven).

When I do this I find that the messages go from INOBX to WASTEBASKET.
If I do not remember to Xpunge the wastebasket, they build up there.
Is there a way to expunge the wastebasket automatically?

I have the same problem (I want my home generated mail messages to have a return address the same as my ISP mail account not my home account) and have partially solved it:

I changed the entries:

"personal-name"

and 

"user-domain"

in my .pinerc file the ISP provided names.  Now my mail messages show up like

From: bmandel <bill@loop.com>
I want it to be:
From: bmandel <bmandel@loop.com>

I guess I can just change my home user account to bmandel, but I would  rather configure pine correctly. Does anyone know of another pine variable like "personal-name" that sets the user name to something else?

Thanks,
Bill Mandel

Hi Richard,
i'm affraid you must do that in two parts:
I- To attach a file to Pine
 1- first you must move your file(*) from your hard disk to the server 
 2- in pine, do the ATTACH

II- To save a file in your hard disk
 1- from Pine  EXPORT to the server
 2- move it(*) to your hard disk

(*) move from|to a PC/Mac to|from the server with : FTP, TELNET, etc

  Dick, 
 
 
  You ask: 
 
     Also is there a way to go to the top and/or the bottom of 
     a file. 
 
 
  Ctrl-W, Ctrl-Y should take you to the top of the document. 
 
  Ctrl-W, Ctrl-V should take you to the bottom of the document. 
 
  If, for example, Ctrl-V doesn't do anything --substitute Esc, 
  Esc, V like this: 
 
                         Ctrl-W, Esc, Esc, V 
 
  which should take you to the bottom of the document. 
 
 
  Cordially, 
 
  Jim 
 
 
 
  HINT.  Always press the space bar once before pressing Enter 
  at the end of text-lines.  It makes editing lots easier.

  Friend, 
 
 
  You ask: 
  
    Is there a way to delete currently marked messages in the index 
    folder without exiting? 
 
 
  With the up-arrow or down-arrow key, position the cursor at the 
  line identifying the message you wish to delete; or, 
 
  Type the line number of the line identifying the message you wish 
  to delete, then press Enter; and the cursor should jump to that 
  line. 
 
  Having positioned the cursor, press the D(elete) key.  A "D" should 
  then appear at the line identifying the message you wish to delete. 
 
  Having thus deleted one or more lines, you can then expunge the 
  deleted lines by pressing the X(punge) key.  You will be asked 
  whether you really wish to expunge, or put out of sight, the deleted 
  messages.  If you really do, press Y(es). 
 
  Test the above instructions on messages you're going to get rid of 
  anyway to see if they work, or work correctly, on your system. 
 
  To activate one or more of them you may have to make appropriate 
  entries in the Pine configuration screens. 
 
  To delete or expunge a bunch of messages all at one time, please 
  read the Pine documentation about aggregating messages. 
 
 
  Cordially, 
 
  Jim

Hi All,

Recently I compiled PINE 391 on VMS.
Using a privileged account (readall privilege) it works fine,
A non privileged user can see the overview of mailfolders, 
but cannot open the mailfolders.

The fileprotections seem to be allright, so what else can be wrong ?

I'm using pine 3.91.  In the Folder Index screen the $ SortIndex
command does not have an option to sort on "To:".  While at a casual
glance this might seem silly for those of us on mailing lists it
would be really nice (e.g. i finally got around to setting up procmail
to save posts to this list to a folder, now i want to pick all the
e-mail out of my inbox that i've saved and dump it all in this folder).
And it would be nice if the "To:" queried if you'd like to search just
"To:" lines or for all recipients (i.e. functionality of procmail "^TO"
alias).

Is there a better place to send suggestions like this?

While we're at it, how about having multiple .signatures based on the
recipient(s) (or other criteria)?  That way I can have one .sig for
the alt-sex-bestiality-barney-L mailing list and another one for e-mail
to the chair of the physics dept here at UW...

Yes, put the cursor at the beginnin of the To: field and edit it.
For example change 133812@alfa.ist.utl.pt
Change to     Seal 133812@alfa.ist.utl.pt
Make sure you put in the space so it doesn't read 'Seal' as part of the 
address.

Hope this helps.  BYE.

There are some "config" values that are marked internally as not
being user modifiable. This makes sense but, in my opinion, they
should be modifiable from the global pine.conf.fixed. The patch
is simple:

These sites presumably trust their users not to create other files in 
this directory.  Not an ideal assumption where Undergraduates are 
concerned :-(

Well, I guess it depends on what you mean by threading...  But to my mind 
the "$O" command sequence gives a good enough effect to be considered 
threading.

In particular, it groups articles sharing a common subject together, 
arranged in date order.

This is one perfectly valid meaning of "threading" as implemented by a 
number of dedicated news reading programs.  Admittedly others use the 
fancier threading based on Xref: field values, and some even do both.

I don't see how you can dismiss Pine's behaviour when the same effect is 
used by dedicated news reading programs.

Cheers,

I have a vague idea that you can use POP and/or PC-PINE, mail coming

into the Unix box and being distributed across the novell network

to PC's( where we use Wordperfect Office Mail)F.  Can someone direct me to
 
relevant documents to help me in researching this possibility?


( Mail comes in via uucp on SCO UNIX V 3.2  I just now installed pine

on SCO ( very nice! ) )

I would like to know if there is a way to make Pine behave like this:

1) Use Left & Rigth cursor keys to move between index & message views
and main & index views (like in fex. Tin-newsprogram). In my opinion 
this would be much more intuitive (and easier too) than current way of
having to use return & 'i' or 'm'.

2) To use arrow ("->") to show "current line". This would speed up
pine's operation much when using slow connections.

3) At start to go to the first message, which was received after last
time pine was used (elm behaves this way by default I think), instead of
going to first message which is unread.

If this isn't possible yet, then I'll present a wish here that they
would be implemented in the next version. These three minor enchancements
surely wouldn't be hard to add but I think many could find them helpfull.

Thanks for any response,
Mikko Makela

Yes, the ** does appear as the freeze occurs.  Does pine read
the entire mail box in from scratch each time it checks for new mail?

No, the new-mail check is denoted by a single asterisk.  The double
asterisk denotes checkpointing changes in the folder to disk.  These would
normally be changes in flag status (e.g. from UNSEEN to SEEN).

The implications of checkpointing depend on the mailbox format you have
chosen to use.  If you use the normal "mbox" format, Pine has the whole
thing in virtual memory, and writes it back to disk.  So if memory is
limited, that means paging in from the swap disk, then back out to the
"real" folder.  If NFS is involved, things get more problematic because of
NFS locking problems.

Does pine support a resynchronize command like elm?  In elm I can hit '$' 
and all the deleted messages in the folder disappear.

Having looked at your 'evidence' I find myself wondering whether you 
aren't over-reacting just a bit - the writer offers a perfectly 
reasonable explanation for his request, since many providers' newsreaders 
lock one into its default headers; if he has a personal domain, as he 
says, why shouldn't he adjust his headers accordingly?

Besides, even if that is not his only motive, maybe he just wants to post 
anonymously; you might not like that, but it is NOT 'forgery', which 
means 'posting as someone else'.  As long as he's not doing that, it is a 
much less serious matter.

Cheers,

Don Miller

Huh?
When you add a name to your addressbook pine asks you what
the full name is. You are not obligated to write the full
name...It will accept eg "Dracula, Count" too...

If the right feature set is enabled on both, then I cannot imagine an
operation except maybe pgp-encoding a message, which I have never used, that
would be easier on elm than pine.  For example, select all the messages with
a given text pattern, or select a folder.  When people make the above kind
of statement, I always suspect they do not know how to use many of the
features that pine offers.  Such statements should be backed up with
specifics so that we can refute them if possible.  As the statement stands
it is merely a religious statement.

Please note, I vehemently disagree with the whole pine Usenet news
philosophy and implementation, and I wish it supported older terminals like
ADDS and ADM3a, etc.

Earlier this week, we had a user try to lock her keyboard using the "K" option.

Then, she could not unlock the session (forgot password).

We have tried to disable the keyboard lock option in the pine.conf but have been
getting:

	Unrecognized feature in feature-list (disable-kblock-cmd)

returned in our .pine.debug# file.

Is disable-kblock-cmd the correct option to enter in the feature list to disable
keyboard locking?  Or are we misspelling it (this spelling is what is described
in the nmanual)?

Thanks,

Mark H. Black

Hello, all:

I just posted the message you probably saw, in response to the rantings 
of someone accusing someone else of being a 'forger'.  As I usually do, I 
CC'd a copy of the message via e-mail to the address listed by the author 
of the message to which I responded.

I got it back in about three seconds, with the error message copied 
below; given the tone of their complaint, I thought it was rather funny...

Sorry. I know this is a FAQ, but I looked through Pine Help, Release 
notes and the Robot and couldn't find what I need anywhere.  Plus I 
fiddled with Config and still couldn't produce a signature at the end of 
my messages.

Can anyone tell me, in plain English, the steps I need to take to 
create a signature at the end of my messages?

thanks,
seth

In article <Pine.SOL.3.91.960213212654.19818A-100000@bingsun2>, you write:
|> In order to try to solve the problem of pine's print to ansii command not

   I have assigned "print" to a script which does some postscript
   formatting of the mail message (header and body in different fonts,
   running page title).

   My script begins with the line

# store the incoming mail in a temporary file
  cat - >/tmp/$$.tmp

  and then goes on manipulating $$.tmp.
  The fact is that Pine passes the message on stdin, not on a temporary
  file ! If you need a file you have to trap it yourself.

BTW in matter of suggestions to the Pine development team, I'd like
that besides passing the message on stdin, some extra info were passed
as arguments. Chiefly I'd like to have the message number in the folder
(the other info I can extract from the mail header, but this one is
nowhere) : I'd like to put a running header on each page saying :

  Message # nn of folder XXX : From YYYY on date DDDD

(at the moment I can do the second part only !)

Hi Seth

Go to your "files" area in Lynx (not Pine) and (C)reate a file.  After you 
create the file, you can (E)dit it and do your signature.  To save it, 
you type Ctrl x (^x).  Once you have done that, it will automatically 
appear when you compose a message in Pine.

I hope this answers your question.

Cheers!

Marsha

Thanks for your reply. I am using SunOS with tcsh as my shell. Following 
your advice I added 'eval `resize > /dev/null`' to my .login file. This 
successfully sets the values in stty so that pine now makes use of the 
full height and width of my screen.

In summary: the trick is to set the correct values for stty. This is most 
easily done (on my system of SunOS and tcsh) by using the resize command 
as described by Stewart above.

Thanks,
Peter

When I reply to a post in a newsgroup, Pine automatically sends e-mail to 
the original poster in addition to to the newsgroup.  It does allow a 
personal reply without a post to the newsgroup, but not posting reply to 
the newsgroup without an e-mail to the original poster.

How do I reply to the post in the newsgroup without sending a separate 
e-mail reply to the orginal poster?

The correct name for the feature list is "disable-keyboard-lock-cmd"

You may well want to set this in the global fixed configuration file 
(pine.conf.fixed) rather than pine.conf.

Well, I have three accounts: two at universities with which I
am associated and a PPP/Slip account.  I have the choice 
between pine and elm on two and between pine and VMS mail on
the third.  I chose elm with pico as my editor and vms mail 
with edt as my editor.  I have tried pine but have found the
others to be easier.

Ummm... Are you sure things are happening quite as you describe?  We are 
using Pine 3.91 here and when replying (R) to a Usenet News article Pine 
asks if the reply is to go to the newsgroup(s)...

...If I say "N" then a message is started with only the "To:" field 
filled in (ie, an e-mail only to the article's author);

...If I say "Y" then a message is started with only the "Newsgroups:" 
fields filled in (ie, the "To:" field is blank so no e-mail will be sent).

If I want to send to both I have to use one of the above and then fill in 
the other field.

However if you are getting both fields filled in (or, indeed, want to 
fill in the other as I do) simply edit the fields.  (You may need to use 
^R (Rich Headers) to get them all displayed.)  To blank out a field (say 
the "To:" field) just put your cursor on it and type ^K (the usual "Cut 
Text" command).

Cheers,

Mike Brudenell                                         <pmb1@york.ac.uk>

    I suppose this is what you want.  In Pine, when looking at a folder 
index, press 'x' for "eXpunge" and all messages marked for deletion will 
disappear (for good!).  If you don't want to have to respond to a prompt, 
go into your configuration and enable expunge-without-confirm (if memory 
serves me correctly).

On the contrary, dear Marsha!  People not using Pine will wonder what the
^a,^b, and ^c are doing in the posts as they dont get to see that effect.
Thus emphasis with asterisks is a lot better as they will show with any pager.

Characters with special meanings do not have the same effect on all programs.
Especially for 8bit characters.   Examples?  Signatures in ibm.pc groups!
Whatever you write - you had better use ASCII (0x00-0x7F) only.
That's why I almost never use umlauts, ie äöüß.  :-)

Btw, Marsha:  If Pine is such a good newsreader then why should there be any
need to quote everything I said, including my signature and header lines?
One word:  Threading.

Yeah, that'd be great.  But to accomplish what you're trying to do, use the 
semi-colon command to select a group of messages, choose "t" for selection 
by text criteria and "t" for selection based on the "To:" field and enter the
text you're searching for.  Then use the "a" command to apply the "s" save
command to move the selected messages to the folder of your choice.  (You can
repeat this process to search the "Cc:" field as well.)

To do this the "enable-aggregate-command-set" feature must be checked in 
your setup.

Try ftp.celestial.com in pub/sco-ports/unix. There is another site

I use  DOS/QL2FAX and except in one instance have had no problem using 
pine.  Another person on Digex.net uses WIN/QL2FAX and is also unable to 
print using the "Y" command.  We have tried everything the others at 
Digex use but with no success.  Is anyone aware of a peculiar problem with 
the QL2FAX program and, hopefully a fix?

Would appreciate any replies be sent via email since I don't cover this 
list regularly. 

TIA

That can be a nice feature.  But in the meanwhile you can use the same
procmail to sort out from you inbox file based on "To:" field criteria
the messages you like.  Just a suggestion.

We are experiencing similar problems here. We are using Pine3.91
and Solaris 2.4. Every so often, Pine will freeze during mailbox
accesses. This frequently occurs during startup. Eventually, the
access timesout and Pine resumes.

This is not just a problem with Pine, however. We have had similar
problems with ELM and WordPerfect. We recompiled ELM so that the
only file locking mechanism being used is the filename.lock method.
Apparently this is an option in the Makefile. This seems to have 
fixed the problem with ELM.

Unfortunately, I haven't figured out how to turn off this locking
mechanism within Pine (and thus depend only upon the filename.lock 
method).

We think that it is a problem with Sun's "fcntl", which is called
within "flock", which is used within imap's c-client.

Perhaps using "maillock" would be a better alternative to using
flock/fcntl?

"X" (eXpunge) will permanently get rid of all messages you have marked 
for deleting and (I think) check for newly arrived mail.  It doesn't do 
anything (either of these) if you have no messages marked for delete.

^L is the accepted way of checking for new mail: it clears the screen and 
redraws it, checking for new mail in the process.

Take your pick... :-)

I had noticed in the past that upon leaving a non-INBOX folder I would 
get indication that some of my messages were being removed. What I just 
realized is that if you save a message that is marked Deleted the Deleted 
flag stays on in the saved message. If you later leave the folder that 
you save to, the message gets removed without any warning. Now, I know 
that I have the expunge-without-confirm option turned on, but I thought 
that was only when you do an explicit expunge. I think that the Delete 
flag should be turned off on the saved message. I can see no practical 
reason to keep it on. 

I know that it's probably too late to put a fix for this in 3.92 
(assuming, of course, that the PINE developers consider this a problem), 
but I just wanted to point this out so that other PINE users don't find 
messages unexpectedly disappearing from their folders.

BTW, I think that Pine is a great tool. (With mail tools like Pine and 
scripting languages like Perl, who needs anything else? :-)

I am trying view this attachment from pine. If I save the attachment, it

I created a /etc/mailcap with the following entry.
 
application/octet-stream; pico %s

The contents are getting garbled even though I can read the saved 
attachment nicely.

Is there any way I display the attachment.

Thanks for any information.

What is the best way to make Pine 3.91 correctly use the arrow keys on a Wyse 50?
I don't particularly want to translate keys coming from the wyse50 so the arrows
will work correctly? Am I correct in that pine ignores the arrows from the terminfo
and/or termcap? Any help would be appreciated.

The old imap-3.6 toolkit has some out of date documentation in a file
called Internal.DOC.

There is no documentation yet for the imap-4 toolkit other than how to
build the IMAP and POP daemons (in the README file).  You need to read the
source code, or get a copy of the old Internal.DOC file and take what you
read with a large rock of salt.

The imap toolkit is designed for primarily for programmers, with a
secondary purpose of providing the latest versions of the IMAP and POP
daemons.  If your intention is to build and install Pine, you are better
off getting the Pine distribution.

If your site is well-managed and properly configured, it shouldn't matter.
Between the sticky bit on the directory and security checks in the agent
(/bin/mail or whatever) that delivers mail, there aren't any security
problems.  Denial of service problems can be dealt with by using disk
quotas or administrative measures; ditto if you're worried about people
using it as a unauthorized file storage area (you don't have one of those
paranoid sites that doesn't let users use /tmp, are you?).

Actually, the cost of disk space has plummeted to below $.25/MB.  There's
no excuse in this day and age for a campus computing facility to offer
inadequate disk space.

    To be honest, I have never heard of this behavior.  For instance, 
when I went to reply to your post, Pine is not trying to send email to 
you.  Are you sure you are using the current version of Pine (3.91) with 
*no* local modifications?  Ask your system administrator whether you have 
a "plain vanilla" version of Pine.

Hi folks,

We installed pine on Sparc Server 1000 running solaris 2.5.  Sometimes, 
we notice some user's pine processes running forever.  It eats a lot of 
CPU times and brings up the load average.  It is really de-grading our 
machine.  The problem is that the user was logout but the pine process still 
running with parent's process ID #1.

I read some of previous article from this newsgroup.  It said it is 
related imapd.  What is imapd?  We didn't install it on our system.  Will 
it fix the problem if we install imapd on the system?

Is it any patch to fix this problem?  I can't find a bug report on 
offical pine WWW site.  Did the pine developer notice that? Is it going 
to fix on next version?  We may consider not going to use pine if we 
can't find the solution.

Well, the problem does not happen with elm, running in
the same circumstances.  It looks like a bug or inefficiency in Pine.

Hi

I have looked but can't find out how to add a receipt to a message, or in 
other words get a receipt for a message that has been delivered.

Does anybody know if it's possible and if so how to do it??

An alternative on Unix systems is to define an alias.  For example, I
use the C-Shell, so in my .cshrc file, I define two aliases:
        alias pn    "pine -i"        
        alias p     "pine -I l"

Then, if I want to enter pine and go directly into my inbox, I use my
pn command (I named it that for pine newmail), and if I want to enter
pine and go directly to the folder list (for example, if I want to
compose a message or if I want to read an existing message), I use my p
command.

I'm not certain what Elm's checkpointing or locking policies are, but I'm
pretty sure it puts its working copy of the mailbox into a temp file
rather than into virtual memory (i.e. swap file) --so that's one
significant difference.

You might consider switching to Tenex mailbox format, which doesn't need
to read the mailbox into virtual memory.  (See Pine Tech Notes for
details).

Please, any suggedtions for the following. When I do a "W" = where is, 
and type "fiji", instead of getting any post with Fiji in it, my screen 
all turns to caps and inappropriate caps at that. For example ? reads as 
? HJ+- and M reads as Mthen a square K+ MJ++ and V reads as [SJ+JL+]. 
Only capitals in news items remain readable. Any ideas. Thanks a lot/

while reading the mail u want to print you can alt l which turns on
the printer...
Or you can export with the e command to your unix directory
and then do a alt f1 and then cat "filename" to save output
to your hardrive..
or three do a cat "filename" precceded by a alt l to go to your printer..

this is my signature file...

 Hi there,
 If i need to copy a text from my Mac - it goes to the Clipboard - to 
paste it into Pico or a mail i'm creating with Pico, sometimes the copy 
goes on a endless look.
 If you can help, please mail me.
 Thanks, CArlos

How can I suppress a long list of CC:s in a distribution list I create so 
that everyone who receives the message doesn't have to scroll through a 
list of everyone else receiving said message?

thanks,

seth

p.s. there would be a signature here if I could figure out how to do it!

Elm doesn't checkpoint.  If a system crash happens, your changes are lost.

For various reasons, the /etc/passwd file needs to be world readable.  
What you may wish to implement is shadow passwording, which leaves the 
userid and GECOS information in the file, but points to another, hidden 
password file for the password itself.  The password field in /etc/passwd 
is then set to * or ! or x or some such character.

In the same way that I can dismiss anything that claims to be something
it is not, no matter how widely implemented it might be.

Subject sorting is not threading.  Subject sorting does not organize the
articles by their place and order in the discussion, nor does subject
sorting allow one to keep up with a thread when the subject changes,
something which happens quite frequently in lenghthy discussions.

One analogy that helps make this clear is trn's "article tree".

If your newsreader sorts on subject then on date, articles with a given
subject are arranged on a line:  while article n+1 may in fact be a
response to article n, it might be a response to article n-10; you can't
tell with a subject-then-date based newsreader, as subject-then-date
sorting doesn't make track the relationship between articles.  When
subjects change, subject-then-date sorting loses the new track
altogether.

Threading, on the other hand, organizes articles in a tree:  on any
given branch, article n+1 does follow article n, and if article n
generates multiple responses, their will be multiple n+1 articles, each
on its own branch.

To make explicit some of the language used above, subject-then-date
sorting is one-dimensional:  the variable of interest is the date, and
dates by themselves do not supply any information about the structure
and flow of the discussion.  X-ref based threading is multi-dimensional,
and organizes articles based on the structure of the discussion; I say
multi-dimensional because the ability of threading to follow a
discussion through subject changes introduces another "degree of
freedom" in tracking a discussion.

You can't. Pine ignores key definitions in termcap/terminfo and
the arrow keys on a Wyse 50 aren't reprogrammable short of
blowing a new EPROM.

  I have some patches to Pine 3.91 that add correct use of key
definitions in termcap/terminfo plus they fix some bugs and add
some features (but they are optional). Let me know if you want
them. If also have SCO and Linux binaries - but *only* SCO and Linux.

Is the Pine/Pico spell-checker something that can be customized for a 
particular site?  If I sent my system gurus a list of words that I think 
should be added to Pine's dictionary, could they do it?

Hi,

When I forward a mail or reply (with the original message text included), 
my sig appears at the top of the mail with the message text following 
it. Of course I can manually transfer it to the bottom of the text but is 
it possible for this to happen on its own?

Use bcc: which is available in rich header mode (^R).

    Put the list in the Bcc: field.  Just be sure to put _something_ 
(such as your own address) in the To: field.

Hi.  I was trying to delete some mail while using PINE the other day (on 
my university's account), but PINE said that it cannot delete the mail 
because the folder was "READ ONLY" (and whenever I open the folder, it 
says "READ ONLY".  How do I bypass this?  Or toggle the readonly off?
thanks

Please try to e-mail me as I don't check the group often.

Hi, I want to send email to a large list of addresses.  How can I read in 
the list to the TO: field?  When composing message text it is possible to 
read in a file from your directory, I want to do the same thing with a list.
In the alternate, can someone recommend a ail program that will allow me 
to do import a dbase file or ascii list as an email list?

Is there a way to make Pine not show this kind of escape characters etc.

In one of the newsgroups I have had my screen lock up several times
because of a person that uses escape sequences in his From: address.

If you're using linux, this is probably because /usr/bin/spell is a
link to ispell.  Make /usr/bin/spell be the following file instead:


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
#! /bin/sh
#
# A front-end to ispell which allows it to act like the "spell" program
# By: Christopher Neufeld <neufeld@caliban.physics.utoronto.ca>
#

case $# in
        0)      ispell -l | sort | uniq ;;
        *)      cat $@ | ispell -l | sort | uniq ;;
esac
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This will make the command "spell" behave like the typical unix spell 
command.

To actually use ispell with its list of suggested words, you can make 
ispell the alternate editor by adding the following to your .pinerc:

editor=/usr/bin/ispell -x

Hope that helps.

The simplest approach would be to define a distribution list in the
pine address book.  See the pine help for details.

No, they expect the mail programs not to create arbitrary files using
their setgid status.

Send mail to "postmaster@host.domain" with subject "loginstat username", eg:

	To: postmaster@blue.weeg.uiowa.edu
	Subject: loginstat ringnald

Btw, there are two errors in your post:
1)  You mipselt your name    ("Ringnlada" instead of "Ringnalda").
2)  You mispllt your address ("RRingnald" instead of "ringnald").

HTH.

Pine does not do threading and doesn't claim to do threading.
OrderSubject sorting is still useful, but it certainly isn't true
threading.

I asked about this a while back on this list.  I seem to recall that Pine 
3.92 will contain some enhancement/changes to suppress the display of 
such "problem" characters.

Thereby causing yet more potential confusion for us poor Brits 
still suffering under the legacy of reversed domain names compared with 
the rest of the world.  ("it" = "Italy" and "dk" = "Denmark" ... so is 
"it.dtu.dk" in Italy (old-style Brit terminology) or in Denmark 
(new-style (world-compatible) Brit terminology).

Thankfully problems are now much fewer given the radical change within 
the UK over to conventional Internet address ordering.  :-)

I could not link pine on SCO machine. It says libcrypt.a cannot be found.

Man pages of 'crypt' says libcrypt.a is not distributed outside U.S. How 
can I overcome this ?

Well, the ^^ means control-^ and the ^ is a shift-6.
So this gives a control-shift-6.  Did you press all the buttons?

Exactly my point.

Had you missed the earlier articles in this dicussion wherein some users
claimed that it "depended what you meant by threading"?  Perhaps the
comments of pmb1@mailer.york.ac.uk (Mike Brudenell) will refresh your
memory:

which lead to my comments, above.

Not true.  My recipients want to receive mail or usenet postings
that conform to normal conventions - irrespective of what size 
window _I_ happen to use.

That was also my feeling, and if cntrl/J really does adapt to the
window size then I don't see it (nor would I want it to).  

I'm still hoping we'll get an answer...

(actually this isn't "justifying" in the technical sense, it's
line wrapping, but let's not quibble about terminology, I think
we know what's meant here).

Get yourself Support Level Supplement lng225b from SCO. It can be found 
on ftp.sco.com or with your SCO reseller.

This supplies you with the missing libraries and an documentation file.

Yes  --- when I press control-shift-6 (at the same time), I get 6
and do not mark the start of block of text.

Hello everyone,

	I'm afraid this may be a stupid question, but ...  While I was in 
Pine, I got a message at the bottom of the screen asking for a Talk 
session.  I had not done this before and did not know what to do.  I now 
have instructions, but they say "from the unix prompt".  Does this mean I 
need to make a quick note of the person who wants to talk to me and then 
quit pine and go into unix?  Or what?

	TIA

Connie (marigold@ux1.cso.uiuc.edu)

Been there...

Hit [escape-escape-Shift-6-shift-6].  This info is in man pages in some
versions of Pico and Pine.  This will mark text, when ^^ won't.

I don't know why it's ^^ sometimes works and sometimes you need the
'escape-esacpe,etc.  If you find out more, please let me know.

I subscribe to a mailing list available only in digest
form. That means when one includes a message of value to
me, I have to save alll the messages.

Is there a way for pine to de-digestify a mail message? If
not, is there a preprocessor that will?

Thanks,
Pete

PS: Please reply by email -- I'm really eager to do this.
Thx.

I'm using pine for both e-mail and News browsing. When I reply a folloup
to a News posting I'd like to also send it as mail to the person who
posted the message. The only way I've found up to now is to post the
folloup, then go to the send messages folder and forward the message. Is
there any better way to do this ?

Many thanks,

What's the best way to get a Pine address book (Unix) ported over
to a Netscape 2.0 mail utility (Windows 3.x)? Thanks!

There is a flag ("use-current-dir") which makes pine export a message into
the *current* directory instead of the home directory. Of course you can
give pine a (absolute or relative) path, as when saving in the home
directory. 

I like to have one "default" directory for files exported from usenet news
and emails. Because I want to run pine from any directory, I use the
following two-line shell script: 
  cd ~/post
  pine

I hope this helps!

-On the same note, I sometimes get mails with large attached files. After 
having exported the attached file, I want to keep the message, but delete 
the attached file. Possible?

Connie,

If you want to engage in the "talk" session, you need to quit Pine and go
to your shell prompt. Then, perform the "talk soandso@blah.blah.com"
command to connect with the person calling you. Yes, jot down the address 
because you might forget it backing out.

I recall seeing the original questions, but don't remember if you said 
what rerminal emulator and type of computer you were using.

There was certainly a problem with versions of NCSA Telnet on Macs, for 
example, which exhibited exactly the sort of problem you describe.  In 
particular you had to install the "Fixed Controls" keyboard resoruce 
(drag it onto the System Folder's icon) and then select it in the 
"Keyboard" control panel.  This was to let the Mac generate some 
keystrokes (such as ^^) that it couldn't under the usual keyboard mapping.

The latest (and last!) version of NCSA Telnet for Mac (2.7b5, if I recall 
correctly) handles such keystrokes much better, without the need for the 
KCHR resource.  (This is going off the release notes: I still use a 
slightly modified resource because of some other requirementes I have, so 
cannot say for certain).

If you are using NCSA Telnet on a Mac, especially a version before 2.7b, 
you should look at either installing the keyboard resource or (better) 
upgrading to the latest and last Telnet.

Cheers,

Mike Brudenell                                         <pmb1@york.ac.uk>

Maybe formail from the procmail package could solve your problem.

You can suspend pine (Ctrl Z). This will take you to your unix shell from 
where you can talk. After finishing, type fg. This will take you back to 
exactly where you were when you suspended pine.

You will first have to enable-suspend by going into Setup (Configure). 
There is an option in the feature list.

In PC Pine, when I try to sort the inbox by Date, it takes forever!  I am 
working with a Sun mail server and IMAP.  Other sort criteria are much
faster, and on the unix version there is no difference.  Anyone have the 
same experience? I have about 120 messages in my inbox.

Thanks,

Moshe

Hi there. I would be very appreciative if anyone could help with my
problem. I am on the LA Freenet which does not support MIME code in its
e-mail. I received a large file encoded in MIME so I am unable to de-code
it. The sender can't re-send it in ASCII. I tried downloading it by
capturing the text but that didn't work. I tried using Kermit, X,Y &
Z-Modem but those didn't work either. I aksed the moderator of the LA
Freenet & he couldn't help. The file was sent using Eudora but I can't use
Eudora on the LA Freenet. Can anyone offer helpful suggestions? This file
consumes 63% of my mailbox just sitting there so I'd like to be able to
download it to a floppy at least. Thank you.

Hi my name is Jill
I use Pine at work (UW employee) on a PC, no problems.
I am currently getting pine e-mail service at home through my son's school 
remote server. 
For some reason I am unable to print my e-mail messages using the 
Y command. I get the message "attached to ansi"( or whatever) and then 
press Y again, all it  does is scroll through part of the e-mail message 
but doesn't print.  
I have a Mac Performa and an Apple Stylewriter 2400. 
Do I need to reconfigure something in order to print?
Thanks.
Jill

Hi Jill,

How are you connecting your Mac at home to your son's server? via PPP and 
running Telnet as a client?

If so, then you need the latest version of Telnet in order to "print to 
ANSI" to work... Telnet 2.5 does not work for local printing....
You need to get Telnet 2.6 (which I am using) for Macintosh in order to 
print your e-mail on your Mac...

Good luck...

I started using pine when I got to UW because it was supported on all of the
platforms we had available, and found it to be able to do almost everything
that I liked about elm.  I have a couple of things that I wasn't able to
figure out how to do:

1) Search entire messages for a string.  The [W]hereis command looks for
strings in headers, but I couldn't figure out how to get it to search the
entire message.

2) Send encrypted mail.  Not a regular occurrance, but it has come in handy.

Neither of things things are a big enough deal to get me to go back to elm.
There are, however, a few annoying things which are about to cause me to go
back to elm if I can't get them resolved.

1) When using IMAP to get my mail off of another machine, pine crashes
regularly (like sometimes every five minutes - other times every few days),
saying that my inbox was closed due to an access error.  I sent in a bug
report and got no reply (maybe that's standard).

2) When I changed to reading just from a local inbox file, it pauses for
about 20 seconds each time it wants to sync the file.  I never noticed this
pause with elm.

3) When I get new mail, and it displays the "New mail!" message at the
bottom of the screen, it pauses again for about 5 seconds.  Not
life-threatening, but annoying enough to bother me.  Probably there's a
config option for this one.

In fairness, there are a couple of things that I like better in pine. 

1) The postpone message is better in that it remembers who you were sending
to and you can have several postponed messages; however, there's no way to
forget about a postponed message without resuming it and then cancelling it.

2) The entering of To: and Cc: addresses is better in that it's easier to go
back and change them; however, it's also a pain because the Ctrl-K (kill to
end of line in emacs) deletes the whole line.  There's nothing worse than
sort of following the semantics of some other program.

It's clearly much more configurable than elm; however, I'd rather have it be
fast and reliable on the things which are important to me than able to do 50
million things that I don't care about.

Do you mean that you want to read a file in something that runs off the 
$home dir?

I did this (If this is what you want)
In my $home, I have a subdirectory called 'text'
And within that dir, a file named 'flame'

When I composed a message, I used ^R  and when prompted for the file 
name, I entered text/flame...

Hope this helps, but then again I may be way off base..*l*



: I had a user ask me if he could read/write to the folders in
: the directory where he started pine, like elm does (never tired it?).

: He apparently has many folders orgainized the way elm makes you
: do things.

: We're running Solaris 2.3, if that helps.

: please respond to my email address if you can (as well as post),

: thanks,

I encountered a tough opposition when trying to connect from UNIX pine
to a VMS INBOX.  Here are the facts.  If you have ANY clue please let
me know; I've ran out of ideas...

I have pine 3.91 installed under UNIX (SunOS 4.1.3) and works great!

The trouble comes when one of my colleagues tries opening its VMS
INBOX using pine under UNIX and VMS POP3 (i.e. opening the folder:
{polclu/pop3}INBOX).  Invariably pine fails for him with:

        Bug in Pine detected: "Received abort signal".

after connecting to VMS POP3 daemon.  The POP3 daemon log looks like:

$ type POP3_SERVER.LOG;9
MultiNet POP3_server Flags = 0, Version = V3.4
s: +OK 5 messages in folder NEWMAIL (V3.4)<CR><LF>
c: STAT<CR><LF>
s: +OK 5 32835<CR><LF>
recv_cmd: Socket closed by peer
  SARTORI      job terminated at 20-FEB-1996 18:05:16.26
$

There is no error log on the UNIX side except the message above.

The strange part is that I can log into *my* VMS INBOX using exactly
the same binaries (pine, pop3, UNIX and VMS machines, etc.).  The only
difference that I've discovered is that the disks on which our VMS
accounts are located are different.  I've already checked the VMS
permissions and are the same.  There is no difference not even in VMS
mail configuration.

Please let me know if you have any idea.  I don't know where to continue
digging.

Many thanks,

Mihai Lazarescu

Thanks to all of you who responded, privately and publicly.  Apparently a 
lot of us have learned something today that we did not know yesterday.  I 
know I have learned so many tips here--this is just another example.

Many of you are so generous with your time and expertise.  I'm very grateful.

Connie

I am not sure toomany of you will even see this but here goes.
I have read a bunch of stuff caiming great multiple address books.  
They all seem to say that their is an option on the features list to enable
it.  I couldn't find one.  All I could find is the expanded thing.
I can have a personal and a global but I can't make the gloabl.
I want to have a personal, a work, and one for people from  certian places,
things like that.  Anyone with any ideas please mail them to me.
I don't read this grooup too often and even when I do I don't usually get
everything that is posted.  Thanks a bunch

	Does this work with every version of Pine?  What does fg stand for?

Hello, my inbox of email is stuck on READ ONLY. Tell me if this is what 
is doing this. Sometimes when I open pine and then press L for the 
folders it seems to get Hung-up. It just sits there for the longest time 
sometimes 5 minutes plus. I dance around the key board and nothing 
happens so I reach over to my modem and turn it off and then back on 
again and redial to get back on line. Is this why I get stuck in READ 
ONLY when I come back online? If so how do I fix it I can't edit my INBOX 
and it is getting pretty full. HELP  thanks for your help, Joseph

You can also put a "./" at the start of the filename, which will then 
read it from the current directory.  (I think other relative path 
features (.., etc) should work too.)

Use the "Select" command instead.  You may need to enable this first in 
the Setup Configuration screen (the "enable-aggregate-command-set" feature).

Then, in the Message Index, type...

	;		... Select messages whose
	T		... Text
	A		... of the entire message
	string		... contains this string

Having selected some messages in this way you can then apply a command to 
the whole set (A then command), or zoom the index to just list the 
selected messages (Z ... another Z will unzoom it).

The select command provides a good deal of flexibility in selecting 
messages by various criteria including, if you use ";" when you already 
have a set of messages selected, to Broaden a search (OR criteria 
together) or Narrow it (AND them together).

> 2) Send encrypted mail.  Not a regular occurrance, but it has come in handy.

This is possible in Pine 3.91 by setting up the alternate editor command 
to invoke a shell script/program you write to process (encrypt) the 
data.  You then compose your message, followed by the "Alternate Editor" 
command to pipe the message through your script.  This has been explained in 
detail at various times... try checking the Pine Information Centre:

"fg" stands for "foreground".  It is not a Pine command (you've suspended 
-- left -- Pine, remember) but a command to the UNIX shell (command 
interpreter) you are using.

Most of the more modern UNIX shells allow programs to be suspended 
(frozen) or even suspended then moved to carry on running in the 
background.  The commands typically used to do this are:
	^Z		...suspend current process
	fg		...resume suspended process, bringing it to the
			   foreground again
	bg		...put suspended process into the background and
			   start it running again

Note that not ALL shells support this (for example the commonly used 
Bourne shell (sh) doesn't), and some more esoteric shells may use 
different commands.

To find out more see the man page for the shell you are using.

Cheers,

My problem marking text went away when I upgraded NCSA Telnet to

2.7b4 control-^ works, as it should.

I need the ability to receive e-mail using my own domain name, but
forarding the mail to eight different users.

I need to have eight different "aliases" (i.e. alias1@domain.com,
alias2@domain.com, etc), with each alias forwarding the mail to a
different ISP account. For instance mail sent to "alias1@domai.com"
would forward to "user@netcom.com", but mail for "alias2@domain.com"
would forward to "user@eworld.com".

Can I do this through pine? Is there a better/easier way?

TIA

I do not know much about pine that is why I would like to ask for your 
help.  My sent-mail folder has been fused into one sent-mail(READONLY) 
file.  All the messages I write now cannot be added to this file and they 
cannot be saved anywhere.  Please help me if you know what happened and 
if you are able to tell me how to separate my messages again.

Thanks for your help.  Erzsebet Szilagyi

No, you can't do this with Pine (it is for reading mail *after* it has 
been delivered).

Instead you need to persuade the software which does the delivery to 
reroute the message.

Assuming you are using a UNIX system the chances are that it is using 
"sendmail" to do this.  Try reading the man page for sendmail, 
particularly the section talking about ".forward" files.

Cheers,

Pine doesn't do this.  Instead an MTA such as sendmail or smail is
responsible for forwarding.  The easiest way is to use a .forward
file.

Hello there,

My question is as follows:

when I compose a new message i edit it and after leaving the editor I press
^X. Then Pine asks me if I want to send the message. Is there a way to skip
this question and send the mail right away ???

Thanx

Ray

Has anyone integrated the Ph or ldap 
capability into PINE in anyway.  I guess the 
address book capability would be the likely 
place.

 How can I print out the help manual for Pine?
I tried using the "Y" command but that only sends the
help instructions to the screen not to the printer.

Hi, I have inatalled pine on a UnixWare server.  The end users access
Pine using  PC's (PcPine), Kermit emulation  or dumb terminals.

Is there a MacIntosh version of Pine?  If yes, where do I look for
information.

Thanks.  JjT

Mac or Windoze Eudora?  Set the default encoding of Mac Eudora to
AppleDouble (turn on balloon help and see what Eudora itself tells
you).  I suppose you should set Windoze Eudora to use uuencode if it
does it.  In no case should you ever use Binhex.

There was some discussion on this list earlier about a problem with pine 
when built at DGUX 5.4R3.10 with Maintenance Update 02 installed.

I have just installed Maintenance Update 03 and rebuilt pine, and it 
seems to be working just fine.

I apologize in advance if this is the wrong group.  I could not find a 
comp.news.pine ng.

Anyway, is there a way for pine to use killfiles in the newsreader?

A couple of different ways, actually:

Type the list of addresses, seperated by commas in the "To:",
"Cc:", or "Bcc:" fields.

Create a group in the pine address book that contains all of the
addresses you wish to send to (very usefull if you will be sending
to this list more than once).

   Try to creat a .forward file in your home dir., and put a line like

   \br, user_id@place_to_forward_to
        
   in the file. that's it. hope this helps.

I think you should check the `procmail' distribution.  Is a program called
`formail' in there that can solve most of the tasks related to incoming
mail filtering.  I'll attach the man page of it.

You're probably leaving pine processes running when you disconnect.
Killing such a process when you reconnect should give you read/write
access.

First, find the processes' PIDs (process IDs), by a command like

  % ps -efl | grep ftek | grep pine

or

  % ps auxw | grep ftek | grep pine

Then kill each process by using its PID.  I like to use a "general kill,
then a certain kill" (the expression should not be taken overly
literally):

  % kill PID1 PID2 ...
  % kill -9 PID1 PID2 ...

Hope that helps,

Hi, first use the export command (E) to save the file in your home 
directory, then download it using configuraitons of your system, be it 
UNIX or VM. Cheers, Emmanuel.

Has anyone found a solution to this?  We are havingthe same problems
with pine and elm.  I can fix it in elm, but not in pine.

I'm having a consistent problem with pine 3.91 that is probably easily
explained, but I don't get it.

I've tried to set up my default folder collection for saved mail to exist
on our imap server (which is the Cyrus 1.4 imap server).  I can save mail
to folders that already exist.  I can also create a folder from the folder
menu, and then save email to it.  But if I try to save mail to an imap
folder that doesn't already exist, pine fails to create a new folder,
saying instead TRYCREATE folder doesn't exist.

I thought the behavior to an IMAP server was supposed to be the same as saving
to a local file - that is, that the folder would be created automatically.

Am I missing some sort of option or preference value here?

I'm using Pine v3.89, and when I include the original message I'm replying to in
my reply, my .signature file is placed at the top of my message, above
the message I'm replying to. I used a version of Pine a year ago (when I
was at another University) that didn't have this problem. Is there
anything I can do about it?

Please email me at cm5bcmc@bs47c.staffs.ac.uk

Thanx in advance

	You really should consider upgrading to 3.91.  I don't think 3.89
had the nice configure menu....but that was a long time ago.

	Anyway, you can edit your .pinerc file and in the feature-list
section include signature-at-bottom.

  Goog morning
  If i need to copy a text from my Mac - it goes to the Clipboard - to 
paste it into Pine on a mail i'm creating with Pico under a Unix server, 
sometimes the copy goes on a endless loop.
  I need urgent help. Please mail me
  Thanks, CArlos

I really can not agree. A lot of peaple in Russia (and I believe, in other
countries too) nead "encode anyway" prompt in Pine not only in attachments and
even with not only 7bit texts.

In Russia 80% of people use e-mail on MS-DOS PC's with very simple UUCP
package.
And thay never heard about MIME, thay don't know how to get something by ftp
and so on. That's why a lot of people in Russia want to write 8bit messages in
"KOI8-r" charset without any encoding.

Try looking in Pine's Setup Configuration screen (S then C from the Main 
Menu).

See the interesting looking option entitled "signature-at-bottom"?

Not a safe assumption that you can get away with the process - keep in 
mind that the UNIX program doesn't respond to your mouse and it can't 
necessarily keep up with the paste.  Pine and pico assume that input is 
coming from the keyboard and you can usually get away with the cut&paste 
game for small pieces, but I certainly wouldn't  expect it to be supported.

If you need to insert text, the recommended means is to upload either via 
FTP or modem the text to your home directory and use ^R to insert it into 
the text of message.

When I send messages to listserv groups or myself, my inbox index shows,
             "To: listserv name", rather than indicating that it's from
my name.  I'm using Pine 3.1 and have tried various SETUP/CONFIGURE 
settings.

Where have I gone wrong  -- or at least not gone right   : - )    ?

Steve,
There are two mysteries here.  You're right, the behavior should be the
same in both the local and remote case, but in both cases Pine should
prompt you ask whether you want to create the new folder.

Can you double-check what you're seeing in the local case?  Then we can
concentrate on whether you have discovered a bug in the way Pine and Cyrus
imapd interact.

I just got an account with a free-net and would like to set up
automatic mail forwarding to another email address. I've checked
all the available help files that the free-net has, but can find nothing
that explains how to set this up.
I check my free-net account rather infrequently, but don't want to
miss any important messages.
Can anyone explain how I can set this up?
Thanks

When you do a save to a non-existent folder, pine just does a copy - so 
it fails.  I've posted a new message on this providing a little more 
detail.  The RFC's warn that this may be an interoperability problem.  We 
could probably fix it, but I have to believe that someone else has had 
this problem already.

I've also posted to the appropriate Cyrus mailing list.

Pine *should* be triggering on the TRYCREATE token from the Cyrus server
and prompting you to ask if you want it to create the folder.

Try running at -d9 debug level and send us the relevant .pine-debugN
section.

Thanks.

Hi,

On 02/22/96 at 02:48 PM, you said:

You are doing nothing wrong. Pine is showing that "YOU" wrote the message,
and the important part, according to it, is that who it is going "TO", not
who it is From anymore.

I posted this before, but have gotten no response so far:

Is there a way to delete attached files while keeping the message?
(Does this have anything to do with the ongoing Killfile-discussion?)

Thanks!

Alas, no, Saving without attachments is not yet available --but it's on
the list for a future release.

No, it's not related to kill files.

How about every 8th person not asking this question and maybe paging through
Internet for Dummies or any other of a number of fine references before
cluttering up mailing lists.

Forwarding Mail:

This is a UNIX function.  Create a file in your home directory named
.forward (yes, that's 'dot forward').   The file contains one line - that
being the address to which you want mail forwarded.  An example.  My home
accounts are jesten@acs.stritch.edu and jesten@execpc.com.  If I want my
mail to automatically be forwarded to my work address, my .forward file has
one line:

xx2884@wepco.com

This is my work email address.  As long as the file exists, mail gets
automatically forwarded.  

If you are confused about how to create a file, that's a new question. If
you are a pine user and can get to the unix shell (if you can't get to a
unix shell, you may need to have your sys admin do this for you), you can
probably use the pico editor.  To start it, type pico .forward    You'll see
a screen which looks very much like when you compose mail.  When finished,
press ^X and answer "yes". Do not change the name from .forward or the
system won't recognize it.

Happy surfing!

Jim

Pine uses your system's "spell" program, so yes, your system gurus

Pico does not currently have an explicit option to adjust the margin,
but it does use the size as reported by the terminal driver.  You can
typically adjust this with something like "stty cols 64" before
starting Pico.  Pine sets a limit of 76 characters, but does use the
terminal size if it is smaller.

Pine 3.92 and the Pico distributed with it will have options to
explicitly adjust the wrap column.

Hi,
Is it possible to have a date-sensitive signature file?
I mean, can I put a date in my signature file, and make it change 
according to the actual date of the message to be sent?

As mentioned by someone else, the Select ";" command provides this.

Painful but possible with 3.91; will be much easier to do with 3.92
(assuming you intend to use "classic PGP"... no support for
Multipart/signed just yet.)

I'll follow-up with you separately on this.  Last week a bug in imapd was
found that can trigger this error in some cases, but I don't know if it
fits your situation.

Pine checkpoints, Elm does not.  Still, 20sec is a long time.  The mbox
format and mbox driver that Pine uses by default read the entire mailbox
into virtual memory, as opposed to using a temp file.  This works better
on some systems than others.  On a system with little memory and/or
relatively poor VM performance (as, e.g., one with slow swap disks),
it can be terrible.

If you don't need compatibility with other mail tools, the Tenex format
has a lot of advantages.

In 3.92, the message display/timing algorithms have been completely
re-done to minimize unwanted pauses.

In 3.92 you'll be able to delete messages in the postponed-msg index.

Serving many masters is tough.  ^K originally worked like emacs, but early
user testing showed that was not ideal for our initial target audience.
In 3.92 there will be an option to have ^K cut from the cursor position
ala emacs, but alas it doesn't work in headers yet.

I agree with those priorities.  Fortunately, most people are not
experiencing the reliability problems you are.  We need to try to get to
the bottom of your Access Error problem.

We have recently been replacing HP Thinkjet and 500 printers with HP 
600, 660, and 660cse printers.  We are having a great deal of difficulty 
printing messages from Pine.  When the Print(Y) command is entered, the 
user is prompted with "Print to attached ASCII?".  "Y" is entered and 
the display scrolls the entire message but nothing is sent to the 
printer or to the print manager.  Has anyone else experienced this 
problem or have a simple solution?  Our user community ranges from the 
power user to the computer illiterate, so we need a solution that is 
either user transparent or extremely user friendly.

"Secrets of Pine 3.9"
 --> Pine 3.91 released on 94.10.11 (fixes some significant bugs in 3.90)

INTRODUCTION

Thank you for trying Pine 3.9!  This version offers many new features,
and even some new bugs, so please let us know about any problems you 
encounter via the "Report Bug" command (B on the Main Menu).

Some of the information in this document is included in Pine's online 
help text, but we hope the additional detail in certain areas will be 
useful to you.  Also, a few items that are not new in 3.9 are mentioned,
since they have not been well-documented in the past.


CONTENTS

 o Overview of what's new in Pine 3.9
 o How to use aggregate operations
 o How to use Pine for reading and posting Internet news
 o How to use "incoming message" folders
 o Did you know that...
 o Errata


OVERVIEW OF WHAT'S NEW IN PINE 3.9

Here are some highlights of what's new:
 
 o Several long-promised commands are now available:
        -"B Bounce" to remail a misdirected msg to the correct recipient
        -"* Flag" to set or re-set message status, e.g. New or Important
        -"| Pipe" to send the contents of a msg to a Unix command
 o Aggregate message operations:
	"; Select" to select a set of messages
        "Z Zoom" to zoom the FOLDER INDEX to show only selected messages
        "A Apply" to apply a command (e.g. Save) to all selected msgs
 o Builtin configuration screen (Setup/Config on the MAIN MENU).
 o News posting.
 o News subscription/unsubscription.
 o Multiple address books.
 o Postpone multiple messages.
 o Customizable headers for Composer.
 o Improved MIME attachment support via "Mailcap" configuration file.
 o Improved support for multiple incoming message folders.
 o Improved TakeAddress capabilities.
 o Feature to invoke an alternate editor implicitly.
 o Features may be specified on the command line.
 o Feature to turn off implicit marking of a message as deleted when Saved.
 o Feature to use current-working-directory for Export, ^R, etc.
 o Control file to specify which options are user-configurable.
 o A Beta version of PC-Pine for Windows/Winsock is now available.

Note that many of these features must be explicitly enabled, either by
you or your system manager, and some may be administratively disabled at
your site due to security or support considerations.  If any of them
don't seem to work for you, please check with your local support staff
before reporting a bug. 

HOW TO USE AGGREGATE OPERATIONS

Aggregate operations are a new (optional) feature in Pine 3.9.  They give
you the ability to select all of the messages in the current folder that
match some specified criteria, and then to apply any of Pine's ten message
operations (i.e. Save, Export, Print, Forward, Reply, TakeAddr, Pipe,
Flag, Delete, Undelete) to the entire set of selected messages. 

The following commands constitute the "aggregate command set":
	"; Select" to select a set of messages
        "Z Zoom" to change the Index to show only selected messages
        "A Apply" to apply a command (e.g. Save) to all selected msgs

As is the case with most new Pine features, aggregate operations are not 
enabled by default so that the basic "out of the box" Pine configuration
may remain as simple as possible.  To use this particular capability, 
set the "enable-aggregate-command-set" feature via the MAIN MENU Setup
command (after Setup, choose Config).

Message selection can be based on message numbers (as shown in the Folder 
Index), dates, status (e.g. New, Answered), or any part of the message text
(headers or body).  Selected messages are denoted by an "X" in the first
column of their FOLDER INDEX entry, unless the "show-selected-in-boldface"
feature has been chosen via the Setup/Config screen. 

Multiple selections are possible.  In this case, Select will prompt you 
to either Broaden or Narrow the selection, and then ask for the match 
criteria to do that.

In addition, when aggregate operations are enabled, the WhereIs command in
the FOLDER INDEX screen will have a new "^X Select Matches" sub-command. 
When you enter a match string at the WhereIs prompt and press ^X instead
of RETURN, every message in the folder whose Index listing includes the
match string will be selected. 


HOW TO USE PINE FOR READING AND POSTING INTERNET NEWS

Previous versions of Pine were capable of reading Internet newsgroups 
(Usenet), but the ability to post messages to these newsgroups, or 
subscribe to them, is new in Pine 3.9.

It is possible that your system manager has configured Pine so that
everyone on the system automatically has access to news.  You can check
this by looking for a news folder collection at the end of your FOLDER
LIST screen.  If it's not there, you will need to tell Pine the name of
your local news server.  Here are the steps for using this facility: 

 1. Choose the "Setup" command from the MAIN MENU.
 2. Select "Config".
 3. Use the down-arrow-key to select the option "nntp-server".
 4. Press "A" to Add a value to this option.  Type in the name of the
    news server for your site, then press RETURN.  You will need to get
    this information from your local support staff.  A typical news
    server name would be: "news.nowhere.edu".
 5. Return to the MAIN MENU by pressing "E".
 6. Press "Q" to quit Pine; then restart Pine.  This is necessary to
    have the above configuration change take effect.
 7. After restarting Pine, choose the FOLDER LIST screen by pressing "L".
 8. Select "News-collection" (you can press SPACE to move to the news-
    collection, which will be the last item in the FOLDER LIST screen.)
 9. Press RETURN if you see: [ Select Here to See Expanded List ].
    If you have used a different newsreader previously, you probably
    already have a news subscription file with your favorite news groups
    listed.  If not, you need to add some...
10. Press "A" to Add more news groups to your news subscription file.
    If you know the name of the group you wish to subscribe to, enter it
    at the prompt and press RETURN; otherwise, press the "To All Grps" key.
    Select the desired group and press RETURN.  Repeat to add more groups.
11. Once you have newsgroups displayed in the FOLDER LIST, you may select 
    them just like mail folders.  

One difference between news and (personal) mail folders: while you can
mark News messages Deleted, just like with mail, you may not actually
eXpunge them from the newsgroup folder.  Instead, you may "eXclude" them
from view, using the "X" command.  In order to remain compatible with
other news readers, Pine uses the same ".newsrc" news subscription file.
However, this file can record very little message state information.  The
"Deleted" flag is the only message status flag that is preserved between
sessions.  

When you reply to a news message, Pine will ask if you want to post the
reply to the listed Newsgroups. When the current folder is a newsgroup and
you enter the Composer, Pine will ask if you want to post to the current
newsgroup.  Even if you say "no", you may manually enter a newsgroup name,
after exposing that header in the Composer by pressing Control-R.  (There
is also an optional feature to suppress this prompt if you'd like Pine to
assume that you want to Post whenever invoking the composer while reading
a newsgroup folder.)

Here are some additional hints about using Pine for newsreading...

 o In most cases, the only thing you will need to do to enable news
   reading/posting is to set the "nntp-server" variable, as described
   above.  For some configurations, such as reading news from the same
   machine Pine is running on, you will also need to set the
   "news-collections" variable. Use the context-sensitive help in the
   Setup/Config screen to see an example of this case. 

 o You may specify a list of hosts for the nntp-server variable. In the
   absence of an explicit news-collection setting, the first nntp-server
   listed will be used for reading news.  Any other hosts listed will be
   used for posting messages if the first host is unavailable. 

 o PC-Pine users, take note!  PC-Pine will normally look for your news
   configuration file (NEWSRC) first in your PC home directory (typically
   C:\NEWSRC) and if it doesn't find it there will look in the same
   directory where your PINERC file is.  You may set the "newsrc-path" 
   variable (PC-Pine only) to specify a different path if you prefer. 
   This may be helpful for compatibility with other PC news readers. 

 o If posting to news groups seems slow, especially if you are using
   PC-Pine over a slow dialup link, set the "news-post-without-validation"
   feature via the Setup/Config screen.  This will suppress immediate
   validation of each newsgroup name appearing in a message you are about
   to post. 

 o If you don't want your subscribed newsgroups to be displayed in
   alphabetical order, you may set the "news-read-in-newsrc-order"
   feature and then manually edit your newsrc file to the order you prefer. 

 o To "catch up" in a newsgroup, that is, mark all the messages as deleted,
   use Pine's new aggregate operations capability (which must be explicitly
   enabled via the "enable-aggregate-command-set" feature). The four
   keystrokes ";aad" will cause all messages in the folder to be marked as
   deleted.  These messages will not be shown the next time you enter the
   newsgroup, or after typing the eXclude command. 

 o In news groups it is not possible to actually expunge messages marked
   as deleted. so Pine will normally suppress them from the FOLDER INDEX. 
   However, the "& Unexclude" command --available only when viewing a news
   group index-- will restore them to the FOLDER INDEX display, and "X 
   eXclude" will make them disappear again. 

 o Remember that when you get "Empty List" for news folders in your 
   FOLDER LIST, you need to use the "A Add" command to subscribe to the
   news groups of interest to you.  Unfortunately, you need to do this 
   one-at-a-time right now.

 o New feature in version 3.91: For those who miss having messages marked
   with an "N" in the Folder Index, try the "news-approximates-new-status"
   feature.  Read the help text that goes with it, though, so you don't
   get surprised when some messages you've seen before show an N again...


HOW TO USE "INCOMING MESSAGE" FOLDERS

It is often convenient to have incoming messages vectored into different
folders, depending upon their subject (or any other criteria).  This is
sometimes called "Delivery Filtering".  Pine has no knowledge of how mail
delivery is done on any given computer, so it is not feasible for Pine to
control delivery filtering.  That means you must use whatever delivery
filtering tools are available on your system to provide this function.
Some of the programs used on Unix systems to accomplish this include: 
"procmail", "deliver", and "filter".  Some sites also arrange for 
messages addressed in the form "user+folder@site" to be automatically 
vectored into the named folder.

Once the delivery filtering arrangements have been made according to the
local practice at your site --and that's the hard part-- Pine needs to be
told about the additional folders you are using for incoming messages,
besides your INBOX.  This is done by selecting the
"enable-incoming-folders" feature via the Setup/Config command.  Then in
the FOLDER LIST screen, you can use the "A Add" command to register the
names (and optionally, nicknames) of the additional folders.  In cases
where these folders are on a remote mailserver other than the one holding
your INBOX, you will need to know the name of that mail server as well. 

Once these incoming-message folders are defined, the TAB command may be
used to scan the incoming message folders for Recent messages.  When you
are in the FOLDER INDEX or MESSAGE TEXT screen, the TAB key will take you
to the next "interesting" message (e.g. one marked New); however, when
there are no more such messages in your INBOX folder, TAB will check your
list of incoming-message folders (if any) for Recent messages and ask you
if you wish to read that folder now.  If you set the
"auto-open-next-unread" feature, it will automatically open the folder, so
you can TAB through all of your Recent messages in each of your incoming
message folders. 


DID YOU KNOW THAT...

 o The "Ret" shown in some key menus at the bottom of the screen refers 
   to the RETURN or ENTER key on your keyboard, and "Spc" refers to the 
   SPACE BAR.

 o The TAB command normally stops on messages marked as "New" or 
   "Important".  In folders where these message status flags cannot
   be permanently stored (e.g. news groups), TAB will stop on any
   undeleted message.

 o You can mark a message as "Important" so that you can easily find it
   later.  This is done via the "* Flag" command.  Once a message is
   so marked, the FOLDER INDEX will show an "*" in the first column
   for those messages.  The Flag command must be explicitly enabled, 
   and it can also be used to set or reset other message status flags,
   e.g. New. 

 o You never need to press "O" to enable the OTHER CMDS, unless you
   have chosen to run Pine in "Function Key" mode.  The "O" key just
   sequences through the key menu to remind you what commands are available
   for the current screen, but all of them are active regardless of which
   subset are displayed in the key menu.

 o The "signature-at-bottom" feature only applies to Replies.  It is
   not possible to force your signature to the bottom of the included 
   text in a Forward.

 o You can define multiple signature files and include whichever one
   you wish, wherever you wish, via the ^R (Read File) command in the 
   composer.  If the file names you choose are very short (e.g. s1, s2)
   this is relatively painless.

 o Pine automatically checks for new mail every 2.5 minutes.  When 
   viewing the FOLDER INDEX, you can force Pine to check for new mail by
   pressing ^L, or if on the last item in the Index, by pressing "N".
   The eXpunge command will also force a new-mail check.  If you would 
   like to have some indication of when Pine is checking for new mail,
   set the "enable-mail-check-cue" feature and watch for an asterisk
   to flash in the upper-left-hand corner of the screen.  (Two asterisks
   mean that Pine is check-pointing --saving state changes in-- your INBOX.)

 o You can now cause the Export command, the Composer ^R (Read File) 
   command, and the Attachment Save command to use your current working 
   directory, rather than your home directory, by setting the 
   "use-current-dir" feature.

 o Experience has shown that printing difficulties using Pine's 
   "Attached-to-ANSI" feature are almost always due to problems with the
   PC or Mac communication programs being used (not all of them implement
   the ANSI standard control sequences for printing), or the printer
   configuration on the PC or Mac;  however, there are cases where Pine's
   printing assumptions don't match what your printer requires (e.g.
   specific End-of-line convention, or suppression of the trailing
   form-feed to eject the last page, or needing PostScript).  In these
   cases, setting a custom print command may be appropriate, perhaps using
   the "ansiprt" Unix command included in the Pine distribution and the
   commonly available "enscript" postscript encoder command. 

 o The Composer's ^R command means two different things, depending on
   where your cursor is positioned.  If you are editing the header of a
   message, ^R will cause additional headers to be displayed, e.g. "BCC"
   for Blind Carbon Copies.  If you are editing the body of the message,
   ^R means "Read File".  The file you specify will be included in the
   message text at the position of the cursor.

 o You can now control which headers show up by default in the composer.
   This is done by using the Setup/Config screen to set the
   "default-composer-hdrs" option.  You would specify a list of headers
   you wish to be visible immediately when you enter the Composer.  Other 
   headers are still accessible via the "^R Rich Header" command.

 o The "H HdrMode" command now conditions not just the MESSAGE TEXT
   viewer, but also the Print, Pipe, Export, Reply, and Forward commands. 
   This command, if enabled, toggles between displaying or including the
   basic set of message headers Pine normally shows and all the headers in
   the message, including the "Received-from: " diagnostic headers.  The
   "H" command is a toggle; be careful to turn it off after use so that you
   don't inadvertently send unwanted headers when you forward a message. 

 o On the MAIN MENU and in all Help screens there is now a "B Report Bug" 
   command that will automatically attach configuration information that
   may assist in debugging a problem.  It will also ask if you'd like to
   attach the current message in case the problem relates to that message. 

 o If you find Pine's tendency to ask you for confirmation on certain
   operations annoying, you may suppress several of the prompts.  Using
   the Setup/Config command on the MAIN MENU, you may choose any of the
   following features: 
       expunge-without-confirm
       quit-without-confirm
       select-without-confirm
       compose-sets-newsgroup-without-confirm

 o You may further reduce the number of prompts you see via the following
   features which cause Pine to assume a "Yes" response to a corresponding
   prompt: 
       include-text-in-reply   <-- applies to Reply command
       auto-move-read-msgs     <-- applies if "read-message-folder" defined
       auto-open-next-unread   <-- applies if incoming-msg folders defined

 o The "+" that sometimes shows up in the first column of the FOLDER INDEX
   means that the message so marked was sent directly to you, as opposed
   to you being CC'd or receiving the message by virtue of being on a
   mailing list.  The idea is that messages with the "+" sign might
   require some action on your part, whereas messages without the "+" are 
   more likely to be "for your information".

 o The "*" that sometimes shows up in the first column of the FOLDER INDEX
   means that you have explicitly marked that message as "Important" via
   the "* Flag" command so that you can easily find it again later.

 o You can cut/paste more than one line at a time in the Composer.  Use
   the "^^ Mark" command (that's the Ctrl-^ key) to set a "mark" at the
   beginning or end of the composed text you wish to delete or move, then
   move the cursor to the other end of the block of text to be "cut". 
   Then the "^K Cut Text" command will remove the highlighted text between
   the Mark and the cursor, and put it into a buffer so that if you move
   the cursor and then use the "^U UnCut Text" command, it will be
   "pasted"  into the new location. 

 o The key menu at the bottom of the composer does not show all of the
   available commands in the composer.  Use "^G Get Help" for a complete
   list.

 o If some control characters don't work in Pine (or Pico), it is probably
   because the communication or operating system software you are using
   is intercepting those characters before they get to Pine.  Some that
   are more likely to be intercepted include ^C, ^J, ^O, ^^, and ^_ .
   If you are unable to reconfigure your communication software to 
   correct this, a work-around is to press the ESCAPE key twice followed
   by the desired control key.  For example, ^C would be simulated by
   pressing "ESC ESC C" and "^^" would be "ESC ESC ^".

 o You can suppress the monthly "sent mail" pruning prompts by setting the
   "last-time-prune-questioned=" variable in your .pinerc to a date far
   in the future, e.g. "99.9"  You will need to do this by manually editing
   your .pinerc; you cannot change this value from the Setup/Config screen.

 o If you run "pine -pinerc new_pinerc_file_name"  you will get a fresh
   copy of your .pinerc configuration information placed into the file
   "new_pinerc_file_name" with the options you are using set.  It will
   also have fresh comments, and then everything in the config screen and
   the pinerc file should match.  Old variables that are no longer being
   used will disappear.  If you ever plan on editing your .pinerc file 
   in the future (and don't want to be confused by obsolete comments), 
   it would be a good idea to run the command:  "pine -pinerc .pinerc"
   Or in the case of PC-Pine: "pine -pinerc \pine\pinerc"  (assuming
   your pinerc file is in the \pine directory on your PC.)

 o You can suppress the creation of .pine-debug files by running with
   debugging turned off, i.e. invoke "pine -d 0".  Note, however, that
   this will prevent recording data that might be essential to solving
   a problem you encounter.  Pine normally keeps the last four pine-debug 
   files in your Unix home directory.

 o You can prevent Pine from saving a copy of all outgoing messages by
   setting the default-fcc option to the null string (two consecutive 
   double quote characters); i.e. default-fcc=""

 o You can learn more about Pine, including a brief history of the project
   and sources of additional information and assistance, by reading the
   Release Notes via the "R" command on the Main Menu.  Of particular note:
   there is now a news group devoted to Pine (comp.mail.pine) and various
   files (documentation and code) are now available via both ftp and the
   World-Wide-Web.  The URLs are:  
         ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine
         http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine


ERRATA

 o The Release Notes for version 3.91 have a typo near the beginning:
      IMPORTANT NOTE: if you are plagued by messages saying ^X or ^Q not
   should say:
      IMPORTANT NOTE: if you are plagued by messages saying ^S or ^Q not

 o The Release Notes also have an error in the configuration section.
   The MAILCAPS environment variable is a *colon* delimited list on Unix.
   (It is *semicolon* delimited only on PCs.)

Before I get flamed royally for this - please excuse my putting all that
debug article in the mailing list/newsgroup.  It was  a mistake, honest.

Steve,
It's a little more subtle than that: neither IMAP2bis ('cept maybe a
*really* old one) nor IMAP4 servers do the implicit create, but in the
IMAP4 standardization process, the syntax for special information tokens
such as "TRYCREATE" was "cleaned up", i.e. changed, i.e. made "slightly"
incompatible.  We didn't notice the problem in testing Pine against our
own IMAP4 servers because (I just learned) the UW server tries to be
nice to old clients and sends both forms of the TRYCREATE response.

It's a Pine problem and will somehow get fixed.
Stay tuned while the folks in the back room reconnoiter...

Did it work with the old Thinkjets?  By and large, the print to attached 
ansi does does work well with any ink jet printers.  You'll do far better 
to just connect printers on the unix network and use unix printing.  It 
works perfectly out of pine.

	If you're really strapped for space, there are a couple ways to 
do it that're really monumentally kludgy.
	You can forward the whole digest to yourself; then cut most of it 
with ctrl-^ and ctrl-K before sending with ctrl-X. Then save the snippet 
when it arrives.
	Or export it, and then use pico to do the same thing. Then you 
can pull the edited snippet back into a message with ^-R, send that to 
yourself, and save it to the file.
	A third way would be to use a second mailer, depending on what 
you've got available ....

Tim, yes and no you can't run a true shell, but you don't need too.  you 
can suspend the operation of pine by pressing ctrl-z, then, when your 
ready to come back type: FG.  this will cause pine to resume operation 
exactly where you left it.  Now, you must first go in to pine 
configuration and activate the suspend pine option.  I hope this helps.>

I meant to say "does not"!

Jim,
Attached-to-Ansi printing problems are usually not a property of the
printer itself, although a printer relying on software flow control is
arguably more problematic than one using hardware flow control.

Difficulties with attached-to-ansi printing are almost always a function
of the communications software running on the desktop machine, and/or the
terminal handling (especially flow control) of/to the Unix host.  Many
comm programs do not support all of the VT or ANSI escape sequences (in
particular they lack the two for printing), and some Unix hosts have
strange and not-always-wonderful stty defaults.

Quick rule of thumb: if you don't get anything out on the printer, it's
probably the comm (terminal emulator) program.  If you get some, but only
pieces, of the printout, it's probably a flow-control problem.

Having said that, I certainly wouldn't want to discourage anyone from
using Unix printing tools to a network printer if that is an option for
them.  It avoids the comm program and flow-control problems above...

I'd take the above one further.  Could there be a hook in pine that
would be called if the username is not in the addressbook and not
local to the machine?  This hook would call a user defined utility
that takes the username string and looks up the address for that
person?  (say from some corporate database that links the name to an
email address outside of the domain, but still within the network)
And don't say global address books can do it.  In a company with more
than 100,000 employees and hundreds domains, the global address book
isn't maintained on unix (but is accessable from unix via a utility).

 I copy here the answer i got from:
Jim ESTER<jesten@acs.stritch.edu>.

 Not a safe assumption that you can get away with the process - keep in 
mind that the UNIX program doesn't respond to your mouse and it can't 
necessaraly keep up with the paste. Pine and Pico assume that input is 
coming from the keyboard and you can usually get away with the cut&past 
game for small pieces, but i certainly wouldn't expect it to be 
supported.
 If you need to insert text, the recommended way is to upload either via 
FTP or modem the text to your home directory and use ^R to insert it.

 Because i had tried it several times before send the mail, SMALL PIECES

I'm receiving mail from other countries that says it won't display
correctly because it was written in another Character set, for
example: ISO-2022-JP

I can find the spot in configuration where I would change the
character set, but when I put a new value in, nothing seems to
happen.  I suppose this is because we have to get these alternate
character sets from somewhere and install them

I can't seem to find a source for character sets or instructions
for installing them on a UNIX machine though.

Could anyone tell me how to do this?

Thanks!

Assuming you're using UNIX, and pine was compiled to allow escaping to
the shell, and the option "enable-suspend" is used (... whew ...), you
simply enter ^Z.  This will put pine in the background and place you
back in the shell.  To get back to pine you normally enter "fg" (it
actually depends on the shell you're using).

I noticed that even with the sig-at-bottom checked, it will still be at

...so, I just made my .sig with quite a few empty lines above the actual

When wanting to send a long message, I have to compose it on line, 
wasting Pine connection time.

How can I up-load an ASCII file to  /home/mail/username/mail, a  
directory in the UoW system, *before connecting to Pine*, so that I can 
attach it to Pine out-going message ? 

Thank you for attention

I know that it works with 3.87 too. fg stands for foreground as opposed 
to bg for background.

Don't worry, on their side it will show your name (or whatever you had in 
that field) on their side.  Any mail that has the from of you on your 
side will show the to side instead! Whether or not it is in your 
sent-mail or Inbox.  Another interesting pine quirk.

Sorry. I know this is a FAQ, but I looked through Pine Help, Release 
notes and the Robot and couldn't find what I need anywhere.  Plus I 
fiddled with Config and still couldn't produce a signature at the end of 
my messages.

Can anyone tell me, in plain English, the steps I need to take to 
create a signature at the end of my messages?

thanks,
seth

Subject: Accessing newsgroups from a remote server

   I know you guys have probably had a few people ask this question 
already, so please forgive the redundancy.
   I use Pine at my work. It works fine for E-mail, but the server here 
doesn't get any newsgroups. I have an account at a university server 
which does have newsgroups, but it's awkward to telnet there and use 
their Pine. I tried setting the "nntp-server" with the server address, 
the same I have Netscape set to when I'm using it to get news (but I use 
Netscape through a PPP connection to the University server, so I'm 
already logged on), and it tells me "invalid remote specification". This 
makes a certain amount of sense, because I need a login name and a 
password to get to my university account, and I haven't told Pine what 
those are. 
   How do I configure this? I have a hunch it has something to do with 
the "news-collections" setting, which I haven't messed with. Can anyone help?
Please respond to me personally, because I don't subscribe to this 
mailing list.

....here we go again....

Automatic Signatures:

Pine will automatically append a signature file to your messages if it 
finds a file named .signature (that's "dot signature") in your home 
directory.  To create the signature, drop to the unix shell prompt and 
start up your favorite editor (probably pico if you're a pine user..) 
like this:

	pico .signature

You should be in famililar looking territory now.  Compose your signature 
just like you compose mail.  Tradition, nettiquette, and some news 
readers "encourage" you to keep your signature down to 4 lines so let 
your conscience be your guide there...   When you are finished, press ^X 
(control X, not apple-X for Mac users who may not have ever used the 
control key before because Mac programs tend not to use it..).  You are 
asked whether to save, just say yes.  Do not change the name.

The next message you compose will have the signature automatically.  One 
other thing you may need to do is go into the pine config (if your local 
admin hasn't disabled setup) and check the signature-at-bottom option, 
but many admins make it a default.

Hope it helps.

Jim

Well, from your unix prompt just start an upload like you normally would 
in your particular software.  You probably can't use pageup if your using 
vt100 or 102 since that is used for the terminal.  However, most of the 
good communications software out there has an alternative for starting 
uploads.  Anyway, once you have started the upload process, you should be 
prompted for a protocall and then the file name to upload, type in the 
filename and the upload should be initiated.

Once the file is on your server, go in to pine and hit c for compose.  
After you have given the message a subject, in the body of the message 
type ctrl-r and give pine the filename.  Pine will import the file right 
in to the message, hit ctrl-x and y to confirm sending the message, all 
done.

I can't use Ctrl X or Ctrl O within Pine as I think the terminal server
getting some problem.(I can use them when telnet but can't when I dial-in)
So, I try to use 'pine -k' to use function instead. However, I can only
use F(1-4) but not F(5-12). Anyone here can give me another alternative
to this condition?? Or, any solution to the above problems??

I'm assuming you can use <ctrl> Z in v3.89 but I can't seem to find the 
option in the .pinerc file.  Where should I be looking?

Thanks.

Itried the directions but didn't get an answer from "postmaster' nor an
error message. I am a complete novice. Is it possible that there is no one
in charge. Pine on our system is almost totally unused. It was only by
accident that I found it a week ago. Is there some way I can find out
other users in my division? I think on list-serv i used a review command
to get a list of subscribers.       18 Feb 1996, Sven Guckes wrote:

I have a problem  when using  the command "Y" (print)  on   PINE:it 
 doesn't  work!
 I am using my computer connected by telephone line  to my university
with a FAX-MODEM with 14400 speed.The mail service always worked well
but when I wanted to print a message (specially the long messages)
the print command (Y) answered :printing  followed by "print 
 completed" but the printer didn't print anything!
 The people of my host (university) ,when consulted,advised myself
 to use the first alternative on the menu SETUP of the PINE.It
 didn't worked either!
 I will appreciate any instructions to solve that problem.

Correct.  In Pine 3.92, such control characters will be filtered out
unless you select the pass-control-characters-as-is feature...

Hmmm...  I don't think any of the Pine Team (developers of Pico) hang
out on comp.editors, so this (comp.mail.pine) newsgroup may be a
better place to ask your questions...

There were some bugs in the pop3 driver included in Pine 3.91.  Have
you tried re-compiling with the latest IMAP-3.6 distribution?

The sig will appear at the top when you are forwarding mails. I don't 
think there is any way of getting around that. However if you enable 
sig-at-bottom, the sig will appear at the bottom when you include the 
original message in a reply.

...it sounds like your terminal server has those key combinations 
reserved for something else.  The DecServer 700 I know from experience by 
default uses Ctrl-X to clear the command buffer.  These combinations CAN 
be reconfigured in the terminal server so by all means pressure your sys 
admin to take action.

You can suspend pine, use the shell, and then type "fg" to go back
to pine.  The regular suspend key is ctrl-Z (^Z).  It has to be enabled
in one of the options.

Would someone please email me the steps to make my pine (under linux 1.2.13) receive email while it is connected to the internet?
Currently, I log in and can send mail from my machine over the internet (via my dynamic PPP connect), but I cannot receive it. It
still goes to my ISP's machine, and is never retrieved by pine.

Suggestions?

As a followup to my previous post, I have found a partial solution to 
killing files.  You can use the group and apply stuff to kill very long 
threads.  I have a macro (any chance that new versions might allow 
user-defined macros?) that kills the selected thread:

;ts^X^Mad;a    Where ^X is CTRL X, ^M is CTRL M

Are you trying to print to your home printer? Because this will not work, 
if you choose y to print it will print to the school's (default) 
printer.  If you want to print the message at home either capture the 
text or export the file to your filespace then upload it.

If you run pine on UNIX, and are willing to settle for a new signature 
with each login rather than a new signature file for every e-mail letter 
sent, then something like the following works.

There is a program called fortune which displays a different quote each 
time it is run.  Create a file, in this case I call it .sig, that 
contains the constant part of your signature file.  Then add the 
following two lines to your .login file:

fortune | tee fortune.txt
cat fortune.txt .sig > .signature

Unfortunately, you get somewhat less than profound and relevant quotes like 
this:

We have found all life forms in the galaxy are capable of superior
development.

the help claims u can mark text thusly

at my university, this works on some teminls ( the PC's or the x-terminals,
forgot which ones.) but not on other terminals.

the real problem is at home, connecting to university via modem.
the home setup is :

a PC
an old version of kermit communication software (same at the  university)
& pine ( or pico )

---------

the university gurus, like some doctors, 
blame the patient/victim.

help !

versions of OS/2.

Hi,

my question is rather simple. I can access the Mailserver of
my provider only with a login-id and a password. This works
well with eudora under WINDOWS. Can I use pine in such a case
too?

	Ahhh.....you have to be careful about what some people post.

	In some cases what they say will only work at their sites.  In
other cases there are some people who enjoy posting information which
is somewhat sarcastic but will be taken seriously by the novice user.

	There is no "universal" method to determine who/if/when others
may have logged on to a particular system.

	Regards,

is the plataform where Pine is going to install.

Thanks in advance,

I wasn't clear enough on my problem.
Say, I posted to the listserv "bbq" and being a member of the listserv 
group, "bbq", when the message arrives in my Pine 3.91 index, it reads, 
"To:  bbq".  Now, I didn't copy to myself, but only posted to the 
listserv, who forwarded to me.  When other's bbq listserv messages 
arrive, the "from" column of the index shows "Joe Shmooe" (the author of 
the message).

Do my messages show up in other subscribers' indices as from "jeanxyz"?
If this is how it's "'sposed to be'", it's just so messy!        xyz

Catalogue Format Options:
1.  19-Part email- can be read by EVERYONE (~525 K Total).

     must know how to download an attached text file and then be able to

     to deal with this option.
3.  For more advanced Macintosh computer users: compressed attached
     text file, created with a Stuffit(tm) self-extracting archive (.sea),
      ~133K.  Can be decompressed by any Macintosh computer user; no
     special expansion software or knowledge of Stuffit (tm) needed.  You
     just double-click on the file icon and it automatically expands
     (unstuffs). This is for more advanced mac computer users only, as
     you still have to know how to deal with an attached file.  It will cut
     your download time by 75%.   Expands out to the same ~525K file in
     option #2.  See option #2 for more info on what you will need to be
     able to do.
4.  For expert computer users: compressed attached text file, created with
     Stuffit(tm),  ~114K.  Can be decompressed by any computer user who
     has expansion software to decompress (expand) Stuffit(tm) (.sit) files.
     This is for more advanced computer users only and will cut your
     download time by 78%.   Expands out to the same ~525K file in option
     #2.  See option #2 for more info on what you will need to be able to do.



Hi fellow 'netters,

My name is Allison Eng and I recently started using a magazine subscription
club in the USA that has a FREE 1 yr. magazine subscription deal with your
first paid order- and I have been very pleased with them.    They have over
1,500 different USA titles that they can ship to any country on a
subscription basis.   As for computer magazines from the USA, they more of
a selection than I ever knew even existed.  They have magazines for most
every area of interest in their list of 1,500 titles.

Within the USA, for their USA members, they are cheaper than all their
competitors and even the publishers themselves.  This is their price
guarantee.

Overseas, on the average, they are generally around one-fourth to one-half
of what the newsstands overseas charge locally for USA magazines.  On some
titles they are as little as one-tenth of what the newsstands charge.  They
feel that mgazines should not be a luxury overseas.   In the USA, people
buy magazines and then toss them after reading them for just a few minutes
or hours.  They are so cheap in the USA!   Well, this company would like to
make it the same way for their overseas members.  They are also cheaper
than all their competitors in the USA and overseas, including the
publishers themselves!   This is their price guarantee.  Around one-half
their business comes from overseas, so they are very patient with new
members who only speak limited English as a 2nd language.

Their prices are so cheap because they deal direct with each publisher and
cut-out all the middlemen.

They will send you their DELUXE EMAIL CATALOGUE (around 525K-big and
juicey) !)...if you completely fill out the form above.  It has lists of
all the freebies, lists of all the titles they sell, titles broken down by
categories and detailed descriptions on nearly 1,200 of the titles that
they sell.

Please do not email me as I am just a happy customer and a *busy* student.
I don't have time to even complete my thesis in time, let alone run my
part-time software business!  Please fill out the above form and carefully
follow the intructions above to get it to them via fax or smail.

They guarantee to beat all their competitors' prices. Sometimes they are
less than half of the next best deal I have been able to find and other
times, just a little cheaper - but I have never found a lower rate yet.
They assured me that if I ever do, they will beat it.

They have been very helpful and helped me with all my address changes as I
haved moved from one country to another.

They have a deal where you can get a free 1 yr. sub to a new magazine from
a special list of over 295 popular titles published in the USA.   They will
give you this free 1 yr. sub when you place your first paid order with them
to a renewal or new subscription to any of the over 1,500 different popular
USA titles they sell.

They can arrange delivery to virtually any country and I think they have
clients in around 45 or 46 countries now.  Outside the USA there is a
charge for FPH (foreign postage and handling) (on both paid and freebie
subs) that varies from magazine to magazine.  I have found their staff to
be very friendly and courteous.  They even helped me with an address change
when I moved from one country to another.

The owner thinks of his service as a "club" and his clients as "members"
(even though there is no extra fee to become a member - your first purchase
automatically makes you a member) and he is real picky about who he accepts
as a new member.   When he sets you up as a new member, he himself calls
you personally on the phone to explain how he works his deal, or sometimes
he has one of his assistants call.  He is kind of quirky sometimes - he
insists on setting up new members by phone so he can say hi to everyone (I
sure wouldn't want to have his phone bills!),  but you can place future
orders (after your first order) via E-mail.

He has some really friendly young ladies working for him, who seem to know
just as much as he does about this magazine stuff.  If you live overseas,
he will even call you there, as long as you are interested, but I think he
still makes all his overseas calls on the weekends, I guess cause the long
distance rates are cheaper then.

He only likes to take new members from referrals from satisfied existing
members and he does virtually no advertising.  When I got set-up, they had
a 2-3 week waiting list for new members to be called back so that they
could join up. (Once you are an existing member, they help you immediately
when you call. )  I think they are able to get back to prospective new
members  the same day or within a few days now, as they have increased
their staff.  I am not sure about this.........but if you email the above
form to them, that is the way to get started!

They will send you their DELUXE EMAIL CATALOGUE (around 525K-big and
juicey) !)...if you completely fill out the form above.  It has lists of
all the freebies, lists of all the titles they sell, titles broken down by
categories and detailed descriptions on nearly 1,200 of the titles that
they sell.

They then send you email  that outlines how his club works and the list of
free choices that you can choose from, as well as the entire list of what
he sells;  and then they will give you a quick (3-5 minute) friendly,
no-pressure no-obligation call to explain everything to you personally and
answer all your questions.

Once you get in, you'll love them. I do.


Sincerely,

Allison Eng


ps.  please forward a copy of this message to all your friends on the net
who you think might be interested in it!  It is a great deal!  If you join
and then they join after you, you will earn a free 1 yr. subscription for
each new person you get to join after you join!   If you exceed 25
referrals, they let you use them to give away as gifts, for Christmas,
Chanukah or any other occasion.  Please be kind enough to mention my name
when you join.   I will then get a free magazine for a year for referring
you.
Thank you.

You can also get Pine to use ispell (an interactive spell checker)
by configuring it as the alternate editor.  You can then invoke it
with ^_ (check your local .pinerc file or the global pine.conf file).

This trick, however, cannot be used from Pico.  You would have to 
run Ispell on the file after exiting the editor.

You can get additional info on Ispell at:

TERRIFIC!!!  

Worked exactly like I needed it to.  

Thank you, David Miller!!

I believe it's right in the shell script, or in the documentation (can't
recall where I got it) but as memory serves, the string is 'd-g'.

Well, "Richard P. O'Sullivan" <rosully@aww.com> recently (960202) claimed on
comp.mail.pine (which is, btw, the newsgroup to ask questions about Pine):
> ^A = ^Abold text^B / ^B = plain text / ^C = ^Cunderscored text^B

I have not tested it, but I am sure that it looks real |<00|_ on birthday,
or christmas email.

>Is it possible to display with Red/Blue/Green background?

Colour is possible, too.  After all, what is multimedia for, anyway?

For colour you have to format the text properly:
First, your mail must have the "X-Colour:" header line
which tells Pine that the email contains colour info.
Second, each coloured text ("TEXT") requires the colour information
which must be set around the text:
	start info / colour info / TEXT / colour reset / stop info

The "start info" is the control-k (^K).
The "colour info" is three characters where each one gives the intensity of the
colours red, green, and blue - in that order!
After the colour info just give the text and end with the colour reset.
The colour reset is control-m (^M) which is then followed be "E" for "end".

Try it!  For best results on a vt100 use these colour intesity values:
"I" for "red", "K" for blue, and "C" for green.

If you use this often then you should make this a pico macro.
Happy kiccolouring!

Sven

	Try using "fg" meaning "foreground".  To learn more about fg and
other job control commands on Unix, type "man fg".

They say the aruba administrators on Unix don't allow us to use "fortune" 
command in order for us not to play game.  Anyway, "fortune" command from 
my aruba account doesn't work.  Do you have any suggestions?

Thanks to all that answered my question.
The answer is: yes, it's not a real shell, but it will allow you to run 
commands from the command line.

Instructions are:
(Assuming you're using UNIX, and pine was compiled to allow escaping)
1. In pine/configuration, check the option "enable-suspend"
2. Use ^Z to put pine in the background and place you back in the shell.
3. To get back to pine you normally enter "fg" (for most shells).

Hope this helps others as well.

Is there any way other than control-l to exit one newsgroup and
then go to read another when using pine to read newsgroups?

Using control-l takes a bit of time.

Thanks for any suggestions about this.

I think you should add news folders by adding News *[name of remote 
server/nntp] to your news collection settings. This is a shot in the 
dark. Hope it helps.

Sorry, it should be News *{name of remote server/nntp}[]

Hello -

Our school currently has a GroupWise e-mail system and a Pine/Unix 
e-mail system as well, with many users going to GroupWise. I'd 
appreciate hearing form anyone with tips about tools to 
automatically convert a Pine address book to a GroupWise address book.

Thanks in advance.

    Yes, that is one part of the problem.  The Pine character set
value refers to what you are supposed to be able to read and write,
rather than what Pine can display for you.  That is, it doesn't change
your display character set, but rather the tagging of mail you send,
or the on-the-wire MIME character set.

    If you get messages with a different character set than your system
defines, you must have a way to display them, which will require in the
simplest case, new fonts.  For some languages or multi-byte or multi-
octet character sets, a completely different display mechanism than that
the 8-bit ASCII-based character sets use is required.


>I can't seem to find a source for character sets or instructions
>for installing them on a UNIX machine though.

    I've started to set up another font archive for X11 fonts, which can
be found at  ftp://ftp.radio.cz/fonts/X11/ .  I'm still in the process
of setting this up, so it's a slight shambles.

    Here you can find fonts for many character sets you might find in
MIME mail which you can use if you run X on your Unix machine.

    I won't go into the details of installing them, other than to refer
you to commands like  mkfontdir  and  xset  and  bdftopcf .  I will refer
you to an HTML document I discovered today...
http://sizif.mf.uni-lj.si/linux/cee/x11/font.install.html

    I hope this will help you to get started, for the easier languages
(such as those covered by the ISO 8859 set of character sets)...

I used hpp (i. e. command `build hpp') on HP 9000/700 workstation running

Hi,

I face the following problem when I am using pine to read news:

Every time I go from one folder to another by pressing TAB, I get an 
irritating beep. This also occurs when I open a folder with no messages. 
Is there any way of supressing this beep. Any help is appreciated.

Nevin.

We are using the Pine e-mailer.

In pine I have a large addressbook which I would like to use in 
Netscapes News and Mail programmes also.

Is that possible ? What is the format of netscape addressbooks ?

Good advice.  This probably doesn't need to be said, but that change is
not permanent (i.e., you'd have to do that every time you do a session)
Fortunately, you can use the "Save Set" command to save that
configuration to
a "telnet set" (which you should then use in the future to invoke your
session).

I did notice in group three of the help notes that no local support was
available. So, I might be right	in thinking the system locally is 
running unattended. I was told pine was good only for usenet news and 
e-mail. Can you use lynx to access the WWW?

I know how to forward all my email from one account to another, by using 
.forward .
Can I forward only certain emails, such as all with subject banana or all 
from bob@etc? Is there a way?
Thanks

When entering a filename in the Attchmnt: header, pine apparently
checks whether the file exists and immediately gives an error message
if it doesn't.  It does not however check whether the file has
appropriate permissions for me to read it. When the file is not
readable, pine types an error message to the screen when sending the
composed message, but sends it anyway, without the attachment.

Pine should not only check the existence of the file, but also whether
it is a plain file with appropriate read permissions.


While I have your attention, this is not a bug, but a missing feature:
Pine should have TAB completion wherever filenames have to be entered.
It does it already for folders.

Cheers,

We gave up on control caret here and added CTRL \ to do the same thing.
I can send the diffs to the 3.87 sources if people are interested. So now
both commands do the same thing so we don't have to tell people used to
the old way to change it. Our problem was we couldn't seem to make a
control caret on a macintosh off the 6 key.

A serendipitous event led me to discover that it is possible to include 
highlighted text in Pico-edited pine mail messages.

FYI, the WordPerfect characters 5,170 (deck of cards `heart') and 5,7 
(classic smiley face), when saved as ascii text and edited in pico, show 
on the screen as ^C and ^A, and yield black on white or red on white 
text, respectively. This is a very nice effect, against the standard 
white-on-black pine mailer message.

Problem is, I can't find any documentation that allows me to create the 
effects directly within the Pico editor.

Can anyone direct me to reading material, preferably in a file somewhere?

Thanks for your attention to this query...

I am a UNIX mail administator treading in the unknown of Windows95...

I'm considering using imapd on a Solaris server and allowing Windows95
dialup users to use PCPine to access their mailboxes.  The dialup connection
is using the Dial-up Networking PPP support that comes with Windows95.

Will PC-Pine work in this environment?  I don't see Windows95 mentioned in
the Pine home page.  The Windows95 device is the "Dial-up Device" and the
TCP/IP drivers are provided by Microsoft Windows 95.

Thanks for any help or hints

ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/ has the Unix version of pine, which comes
with the DCL files to compile under VMS.  However, I've tried compiling it and
it always seems to crap out on me.  The one time I was able to get an
executable, it coughed up a core dump at me.

For the record, I'm running OpenVMS Alpha v6.2 with UCX v3.3.

I use PC-Pine (the Winsock version) on my Windows 95 laptop every day.
At my office, I use a PCMCIA ethernet card, and at home I use the PPP
dialin, both using the TCP/IP stack provided by Microsoft.  It works
without a problem.

You may be confusing different implementations of PINE for VMS.  One 
is a commercial product which you would purchase.  AFAIK you don't get 
it on the net.

The one that we use is a free version, by Yehavi Bourvine in Israel.
It has some shortcomings, but it mostly does what we want.

>we don't have WWW where I work.

Well, then you're working with at least one hand tied behind your
back.  Lynx, at least, exists in a VMS version: get it and use it
(look on comp.infosystems.www.browsers.misc for an FAQ, ask there
if you need further help).

The only information I can offer you about Yehavi's VMS PINE
is on a WWW page:

http://ppewww.ph.gla.ac.uk/%7Eflavell/vms-pine.html

The software is available for FTP (user "anonymous") at vms.huji.ac.il
in directory LOCAL as PINE_3_*.ZIP (for appropriate value of "*"), 
you also need UNZIP.EXE in order to unwrap it.

best regards

You will not find a man page for fg. Try instead to do a manpage on your

fg means for csh, I'd do "man csh".)

This may not be terribly helpful, but I remember reading back when WWW
access wasn't as common as it is now about somewhere you could E-mail
with a URL and it would E-mail back the text. Does anyone know what that
address is? It could help our web-less friend here.

I am running PINE 3.91 on AIX4.1.3. I have discovered a problem with pine 
and was wondering if you have heard of this problem:                      
                                                                          
                                                                          
The problem arises when I find myself with a .pine-interrupted-mail file  
that has a 0 bytecount. As normal the startup process checks to see if    
the interrupted file exists. A message is then issued suggesting I        
Compose the interrupted message. When I reply y, pine aborts.             
                                                                          
I can make this happen simply by touching .pine-interrupted-mail and      
starting pine etc.

I installed Linux RedHat 2.1 on one of my computers.  I noticed that I'll
occasionally have errors in pine.  Usually the errors occur when
pine checks for new mail just as new mail is arriving.  The error
I get is "MAILBOX INTEGRATY VIOLATED -- CONTACT CONSULTANT" (or
somthing like that, I don't remember the exact error message).

Quiting pine and restarting seems to solve the problem.

I think this is due to the fact that pine doesn't have permission to
create a lock file in the /var/spool/mail directory, and thus pine and
sendmail collide when trying to deliver mail.  On Slackware 2.3, I seem to
remember pine being SETGID mail.  However, pine on this system is not
setgid mail:

 hercules:~# ls -la /usr/bin/pine
 -rwxr-xr-x   1 root     bin        863492 Aug 22  1995 /usr/bin/pine*
 hercules:~# ls -lad /var/spool/mail
 drwxrwxr-x   2 root     mail         1024 Feb 17 14:05 /var/spool/mail/

Should pine be setgid to the group mail?  Does this open up any security
holes?

Take care,

This problem has been known about for some months.  I *think* that it is 
fixed in the latest release of the c-client/imapd kit, available as 
imapd-3.6BETA from ftp.cac.washington.edu.

Cheers,

Pine is NOT designed to be run with privileges.

You should NOT run it setgid mail.

I believe there is some discussion about file-locking at the Pine 
Information Centre:
	http://www.washington.edu:1180/pine/tech-notes/low-level.html#locking

You may also like to search the archives of this mailing list there:
	http://www.washington.edu:1180/pine/pine-info/index.html

Try searching for
	 Security issues with PINE

When people attach a file to a message in the dos/windoze mailer Pegasus 
Mail, it does something strange - splits it up or similar.  When mail 
from a pegasus mailer reaches someone using pine, we get two messages.  
One is the body of the message, the other is the attachment - with the 
mime-encoded stuff in the body of the message after little warning of the 
nature of "following is a mime-encoded message blah blah blah".  This is 
causing big problems in our organisation (well, not that big yet, but 
irritating).  Basically, pine thinks the message is just a collection of 
text - we have to extract it and decode it manually, which is out of the 
question for our users (not to mention ridiculous).  Has anyone any ideas?

If I remember well, The Pine Team said yhat pine is not designed to run
setgid mail and that your problem should be solved by changing the rights
of /var/spool/mail to 1777 (note the leading 1). It should restrict the w
right a bit, but allow making locking files. It should work on System V.=20
Fore more info look to the archives. Hope this helps. V. S.

	I was wondering if there's any way of adding some lines to your 
signature every time an e-mail is sent -- a quote, some piece of specific 
information, etc. I read something a while back about it, but nobody 
posted about a solution.
	Is there any way to run a shell command each time an e-mail is 
sent? At least that would enable me to write a small script to change the 
.sig to what I would like it to be.

Please help here.

I don't quite understand all of the above.
  
     <I can send the diffs to the 3.87 sources>


     <Our problem was we couldn't seem to make a
      control caret on a macintosh off the 6 key.>

On my Mac, sometimes ^^ works and sometimes I have to go the esc-esc
route.  It matters not whether I dial into the shell with Microphone, or
telnet into the shell with the telnet program.

Hello to the list!

I'm now having a problem that i've seen before in the list, but i didn't 
pay attention ( "i'll never have that problem"), but now i'm in trouble. 
When i open my INBOX, pine says that it's an READ-ONLY folder, and then 
i can't delete messages (that's strange, because i could do that 
yesterday). I hope that someone could help me, because i've seen the pine 
configuration and i didn't see anything odd.

Tanks to everybody, have a nice day!

Subject: Compiling Pine 3.91 on Solaris 2.5 using gcc
X-Sun-Charset: US-ASCII

Hi,

 I am trying to compile pine on Solaris 2.5 using the latest gcc compiler.
I have taken the tar file from ftp.cac.washington.edu and made the following
changes to the files:

in build, changed makeargs="CC=cc" to makeargs="CC=gcc"

in pico/makefile.sol, uncommented and commented the C flags (i.e.,

#for GNU C
CC=             gcc
LDCC= gcc
# LDCC= /usr/bin/cc
# If you don't have /usr/bin/cc (our Solaris 2.2 doesn't seem to have it,
# it only has /usr/ucb/cc) then change LDCC to the following line and
# give that a try.  This is still using the Solaris compiler but
# leaving out the UCB compatibility includes and libraries.
#LDCC= cc5.sol

CFLAGS= -Dsv4 -DPOSIX -DJOB_CONTROL -ansi
#otherwise
#CFLAGS=                -Dsv4 -DPOSIX -DJOB_CONTROL

in pine/makefile.sol, the same as the pico makefile.sol (i.e., 

# Use these for the Solaris C compiler
#CFLAGS= -DSV4 $(OPTIMIZE) $(PROFILE) $(DEBUG) -DSYSTYPE=\"SOL\"
# LDCC= /usr/bin/cc
# If you don't have /usr/bin/cc (our Solaris 2.2 doesn't seem to have it,
# it only has /usr/ucb/cc) then change LDCC to the following line and
# give that a try.  This is still using the Solaris compiler but
# leaving out the UCB compatibility includes and libraries.
#LDCC= $(PICODIR)/cc5.sol

# Use these for the gcc compiler
CC=     gcc
CFLAGS= -DSV4 $(OPTIMIZE) $(PROFILE) $(DEBUG) -ansi -DANSI
LDCC=   gcc

and then did a build sol.  Below is the following output of the
attempt.  I was wondering if anyone can tell me what flags to set - I 
have tried several combinations (e.g., -traditional) and get different 
results but never a complete build of the package.

Thanks....Dave

    Pico as such (apart from Pine) is an editor, and there is a newsgroup 
dedicated to editors: comp.editors .  I follow it, and occasionally Pico 
questions come up.

	As instructed in the pine robot's reply, I'm hoping that some ONE 
or THING can respond to this inquiry.  Thanks in advance.

Subject: Re: Pine info you requested (last changed Sep 12 15:05)

Thanks for sending me the "Secrets of Pine 3.9" info.  I have two 
problems that perhaps you can help me with:

When I enter "Y" to print, the message comes up, "attach to ANSI?," to 
which I say "y" or hit return.  So far, instead of a printout, all I get 
is three or so characters at the upper left of my screen.

A second problem is in editing a message I'm writing.  Grudgingly and 
wastefully, so far I've had to "cancel" and start again.

Can you tell me (1) how do I print to my local, stand-alone printer, and 
(2) how do I edit a message?

Thanks in advance.

Please forgive me but I don't know the source as good as I probably 
should. I am not using IMAP to get my mail. I am using an NFS mount. I 
was under the impression that c-client.a was only going to be used if I 
used IMAP to get my mail....

Is there any way in Pine of recalling postings that I have expelled in

I use PINE 3.91 and procmail 3.1 and have a problem:

All my filtered mail is moved to ~/mail/IN.NameOfMailinglist

Believe it or not, I don't know how to add these folders to the incoming 
folders list. I once tried it but PINE wrote something like 'Folder ... 
created' which is probably not what I want.

Then another question: Is there a patch out there so that PINE checks 
different mail folders for new mail than /usr/spool/mail/$LOGNAME?

  Hello everybody,


    I am using Pine on HPUX8.05, but my problem is that I can't use the arrows
  key to move in any menu. Is there something wrong in the configuration?

    Thanks in advance.

    Abril.

An interesting challenge!  (to which I will submit a clean-but-not-elegant
initial solution).

Hit F (forward)
Hit ^R (Rich header)
Move down to Fcc and replace sent-mail (or whatever is there) with the
 relative or absolute pathname to where you want to save it.
Move down to message area.
Delete all lines that you don't want to save.  [other edits as necessary]
Hit ^X (Send) [confirm if necessary]

It's saved to your document.

Hi everyone.


    Can someone tell me where I can get the latest version of PINE for
VMS?  I'm currently running OPENVMS 6.2.  Or, better yet, can ya tell
me how to get 3.89 to look somewhere other than a user's directory for
the .pinerc file?

Is there anyway to change the prefixed > in front of quoted text to :
I have used this for quite awhile in YARN and would like to use it in Pine.
Thank you for any help.

I've never been able to use the arrows in PINE unless I was calling in via
a PC to my workstation. (BTW, I'm using HP-UX 9.07 and 10.10).

How would one go about building Pine and Pico for an SV4 system if the 
ability to do symbolic linking  'ln -s'  has been removed.   Are the 
binaries for SV4 around anywhere ???

Please forgive me if this is a FAQ - I have not been able to find
reference to it.  I am sysadmin of a Linux PC and do most of my work,
including email, from the root account.  I have the /root/.pinerc file
instructing pine sessions run by root to use the same folders as are used
by my personal account, dlane (ie. root and dlane use the same .../mail
directory).  Problem is, whenever mail is sent out from root launched pine
sessions, it provides the return address Dave Lane 
<root@stan.lincoln.ac.nz>.  Is there any way I can configure pine to use a
different user name (ie. dlane) in place of root for outgoing mail?? 
Please say yes!  I do not subscribe to the pine-info mailing list, so 
please send mail to dlane@lincoln.ac.nz!  
Cheers from New Zealand,

Dave

Hi, I have a Sun Sparc 5 running Solaris 2.3, I pulled down the source to pico 
and pine.  I don't seem to have all the libraries required and don't really have 
the time to pull them down to do a compile.  Does anyone know/have a 
compiled version they can point me to?  (I have pine ok, still need pico)  Thx

Here's a snippet from "alt.2600". Please DON'T USE THEM!!
There are many people out here whose terminals aren't capable to display
these ANSI-Escape sequences and may go wild !!

This is the format for ansi codes:
[A;B;Cm
 
A=text attributes
0 all attributes off
1 bold
5 blinking
7 reverse
8 hidden
 
B=foreground                 C=background
Foreground colors            Background colors
30 black   34 blue           40 black   44 blue
31 red     35 magenta        41 red     45 magenta
32 green   36 cyan           42 green   46 cyan
33 yellow  37 white          43 yellow  47 white
 
Before the [A;B;Cm you need an escape prefix. You can type it in each time
you need it or you can put it in a file and paste it when needed. I only 
know how to make the escape prefix using vi. It is 4 characters. They are 
^v ^_ ^v ^[ (the ^ means the control key). You can make the escape file
using vi and then you can use your favorite editor instead of vi when 
posting or whatever. I use Pico and I can just paste the escape prefix
wherever needed by using "^r". Here's an example of a flashing white 
"hello" on a red background: ^v^_^v^[[5;37;41mhello^v^_^v^[[0m. On the 
right side of the sequence the "[0m" resets the colors so the rest of the 
screen doesn't blink white on red. All ansi sequences ( like [1;37;41m or 
[0m ) need to be preceded by the escape prefix. When posting an article 
and you are prompted for a subject you can type just anything. When you 
are then put in edit mode you go to the subject line and erase whatever 
you have just typed in and replace it with your ansi text. If there is no
way that you can get this prefix made with vi and put in a file you can
FTP it ( it's 4 bytes ) from me. See my sig below.

When I try to open pine my INBOX is READONLY so I can't delete messages.
I had accidentally opened to sessions of pine at the same time.  The FAQ talks 
about that... but it doesn't say how to _fix_ the problem... just says to reopen
with full access... whatever that means.  I got my ISP to kill all my processes
and that didn't help... so if you have any idea how to solve it... I would
appreciate it.

I have a problem with pico (pine is not installed) help.  I press the key 
sequence for help (CTRL-G) and the only characters that are displayed are 
the ones in the last column and the CTRL key commands at the bottom of 
the page to move forward or exit.  The terminal is set to vt100.  
Both of our terminals do the same thing.  We're running AIX 3.2.5 on an 
IBM PowerServer 930, ksh.  

We re-installed the system and a new version of pico, but it still didn't 
work.  Does pico have to be in a special directory?  It's on the path.  
Is there an initialization file of some kind?

Thanks.

Hi!

I would like to now if it's possible to put Pine sending a certain msg 
(with a file attached) if someone has sent me a msg w/ subj. line for 
example GET ME KALI . What I mean is that if someone sends me a message 
with a certain subject line, Pine would answer with a certain message.
Is it possible?

Use xterm instead of hpterm. Then the arrows will work. i am using HP-UX
9.05 and last year I used 8.0x--it works in both.=20

This is not a particularly good idea.  ^A and ^C are control characters and
at best will not be displayed or have the effect you want on the receiving
terminal.  At worst they may provoke odd behavior somewhere in the transport
process.

The info about an alias address needs to be with the person who sends you mail.
So you either tell everybody and force them to create an alias for you (good
luck!) or you tell them about the other address and make sure that it will be
recognized as a mail alias on your system.  The mail administrator can probably
create such an alias for you - talk to him!

Summary:  You cannot install mail aliases yourself (unless you're the sysop).

using a pc(msdos) and modem, I have installed a utility to intercept the 
lpt1 output and redirect to a file.  Now, I do not have to export and 
then download to pc.

Found the utility in wsuarchive- PRINDIR. ZIP (I think).

I had a similar pb. In fact, saving the attachment in the View
Attachement window converted the attachement a readable file for the
application that created it.

I don't have an answer to your question, but I would like
to know where and how you got the source code for pico.
I would like to see it so I can modify it to handle 
justification the way I want it handled.

I am a beginner user and am having trouble when sending and receiving 
files to and from my personal folder. Receiving them has vastly improved 
since I started using ZTerm communications program and ZModem (instead of 
XModem) protocol.

I still cannot send files from my home computer to my Personal File in Pine.

I am using Practical Peripherals MC144MT II modem with Macintosh Performa 
575.I think my trouble is with "throughput." (?)

The cable from my modem to computer is a "serial" cable.  Would a 
"hardware handshaking" cable and the Pine Option "hardware handshake"  
improve my efforts?  

Thanks

..couple options actually....you can upload it into your home directory 
on your mail server and then use ^R in pine to "read it in" to you 
message. A shortcut that works well for fairly short items if you are 
using a Mac or Windows is to copy it to the clipboard then switch over to 
your dial in session and just use the paste to bring it into mail.  Works 
fine for items that are only a page or two.

We're running Pine 3,91 on HP-UX 10.01 and are having problems
with sendmail aliases/rev-aliases and Pine. The system is a
HP 700/J210 and HP-UX 10.01. 

Sendmail is configured to remap usernames into full Names (outgoing)
and the reverse for incoming mail. It's also set to hide its' hostname.

ie, mail from the user c415khd (at host flff10.nll.se) should be
rewritten as coming from Kenneth.Hedlund@nll.se.

This works with mailx and Elm but Pine makes the 'From:' header look like:

      From: Kenneth Hedlund <c415khd@nll.se>

instead of (Elm and mailx sample):
      
      From: Kenneth Hedlund <Kenneth.Hedlund@nll.se>

I've tried changing various options in Pine but no go.
Is this a bug or a feature or what ?

...I don't recall there being any sort of uploading option in pine 
itself.  If you are trying to transfer text from your Mac into a mail 
message, you can get away with than either by using the Mac clipboard and 
pasting or doing an ASCII upload in stead of Zmodem.  It sounds like you 
have already achieved success, but now are trying to do something that is 
not an option!

I sent a message a while ago about getting newsgroups from a remote news 
server I have an account on while still running Pine on this server. I 
only got one response, which didn't solve the problem (thanks anyhow), so 
I assume that NOBODY here knows the answer. Can anyone tell me somewhere 
else to check with Pine questions?

I had Pine on my area at Uni, and loved it, no problems at all, and I 
found it excellent for setting up address lists. However, the 'nice' 
computer man didn't like me having it, so now its gone and i'm stuck with 
elm *bleurgh* again.

They say they will put Pine on the whole system, if they can find another 
celarus (that's what the name sounded like, anyways) machine that has 
found a configuration for Pine that works.

Please post if you know of ANYONE RUNNING PINE ON A CELARUS MACHINE.

Thanks
Sally.

No Mike it really isn't, but if it was configurable I would have changed 
it.:)

This is not configurable in Pine 3.91's options.

No doubt you could obtain the source code, modify the appropriate part, 
and recompile it .... if it REALLY is that important to you!  ;-)

Assuming the message text is stored in a file on the same computer as you 
are running Pine on...

*  Start composing your message.
*  Place the cursor in the Message Text area.
*  Type Ctrl/R
*  Enter the name of the file containing the text and press Return.

However, if your file is on your micro's hard disk, but you are running 
Pine on a UNIX system then you must first transfer (upload) the text file 
from your micro's disk to the UNIX system's disks.

How you do this depends very much on the type of micro you are using, the 
connection you have, and the software available.  Contact your local help 
desk for assistance.

Once messages which have been marked for deletion have been Expnged (X) 
or implicitly expunged (by exiting Pine and allowing it to expunge your 
folder) they have been permanently removed from the file containing the 
mail folder.

Your only hope is to go and be VERY nice to the person(s) who manage your 
computers and ask them if it is possible to get the file(s) in question 
back from the security dumps.  (This assumes that they periodically make 
such dumps, copying the computer's disks to tape, etc.)

What happens next depends on their policy: here we would be very 
reluctant to do so unles the message(s) were EXTREMELY important and the 
information could not be re-requested; it takes some hours to restore 
files from our dumps.

Cheers,

No, you are mistaken....

The C-Client is a set of routines that perform file handling for a number 
of different mailbox formats.  The imapd makes use of them (to obtain the 
mail it has to serve up over IMAP), but Pine too can use them (when 
accessing mail files directly or, indeed, to open IMAP or NNTP connections).

For convenience the C-Client source is included in the imapd distribution 
as they are so strongly related (and part, no doubt, of the Pine Team's 
push for people to use IMAP rather than direct file access :-).

So there IS benefit in you pulling the latest imapd source kit and 
unpacking it: the revised C-Client source included will be used as you 
recompile Pine.

Simply ftp the kit and unpack it.  I then merely renamed the old "imap" 
directory "imap.old" and renamed the new directory "imap".  Now just 
rebuild your Pine (I did a "build clean" first to make sure _everything_ 
got rebuilt using the new code.)

Cheers,

OK, Shad ... now, take a deep breath and then press ? for pine help.  
Relax, you're not gonna get any help by writing to a robot, but pine has

I did that, but when I try to get to news, it tells me "502 You have no
permission to talk. Goodbye." I don't have the same login here as I do
there, could that be part of the problem?

You'll want to configure the Pine editor feature.  Probably the full
pathname for emacs is best.  See the enable-alternate-editor-implicitly
feature as well.

   3. I want to use folders already established in my ~/mail directory,
   but when I use ~/mail it does not like that, and wants some kind of [
   brackets. I put a [ in front of the path, and it seems to work ok, but
   still complains. Putting the whole path in [] brackets does not seem
   to work at all. 

Is not your first folder-collections entry mail/[] ?  If so, then you
ought to be able to access the folders by filename, with no path
components, punctuation, etc.  You might want to check out the
incoming-folders feature too, if you use a mail presorter like procmail.

No, it isn't possible.

You will need to use something like "procmail" (if it is installed on 
your computer!) to scan the message as it arrives and decide what actions 
to take.

Ask your local help desk if procmail (or something similar) is available, 
and how to use it.

Cheers,

First you must upload it to yer online terminal, most likely, you'll use 
the 'rz' command, then when in Pine, in the _body_ of your letter-to-be, 
hit ^R (ctrl-R), enter in the file name and if all went well, it should 
be there...
Good luck!

The way I do it is the following:  You have to use an alternate editor.  I
like emacs, but you can use whatever you want.  So I set up a script in my
bin directory which contains the following (between the CUT lines):

-----  START CUT  -----
#!/bin/csh -f

/bin/cp $HOME/.sig $HOME/.signature
fortune >> $HOME/.signature
/usr/local/bin/emacs -nw $*
-----  END CUT  -----

And set my alternate editor to invoke that script.  In place of
"/usr/local/bin/emacs" put the path to your favorite editor.  In place of
the fortune command, place whatever command you want to generate the text
which is changing.

In a file called .sig in your home directory, put the part of the signature
file which you want to remain the same.

You're done.

This has to do with how the news server is configured.  You'll
need to touch base with the system administrator.

    If you are running Pine under some form of Unix and if you have a 
World Wide Web browser, I have a technique for doing this on my Web page.

I have 2 email addresses.
Is there a way for pine to automatically send email from 1 account to the 
other?
Any help would be appreciated.

One criticism of pine I've come across is that many people like to have 
outgoing messages to people saved in separate sent-mail folders for each 
addressee.

The problem is that when you address mail to multiple addressees it only 
gets saved to the first addressee's sent-mail folder.

Does anyone know a way around this?  Thank you!
