Subject: Problem moving address book from UNIX to VAX
Date: 29 Feb 1996 22:45:06 GMT
Message-Id: <4h5a9i$rvo@azure.acsu.buffalo.edu>


   Maybe somebody can help me with this.  I have two accounts, one on
a UNIX system and the other on a VAX.  I use PINE 3.91 on both.  I
copied my UNIX address book to the VAX and then tried to open it.  It
gave me a series of repetetive messages (need to resync, file changed,
need to resync, ... and finally writing address book).  Then when I
finally got to look, everything had been deleted except for a stray
character or two.

   As far as I could tell the address book file conformed to the
specification (nickname<tab>longname<tab> etc.) and it worked fine on
the UNIX machine.  After opening it in VAX Pine, the file is empty
except for those stray characters (I checked it outside of PINE).
I've tried it several times.

  Any ideas?  Shouldn't this work?  I've had no problems copying this
address file to other UNIX accounts.  Anyway, I'd appreciate any
suggestions about this.  Thanks.

Pine can't do this... it is for reading messages AFTER they have been 
delivered into your mailbox.  Instead you need to persuade the mail 
delivery system to deliver the arriving messages elsewhere.

On UNIX systems the delivery software is commonly "sendmail", and you 
control this feature by setting up a ".forward" file in your home directory.

Try reading you on-line manual page for sendmail for help ("man 
sendmail") or ask your local help desk for assistance.

Cheers,

Thanks for this piece of information, but my question was slightly 
different. I wasn't referring to mails which have been *expunged*, but 
postings which have been *excluded* (maybe I misled you with my subject). 
In other news readers, such as tin you can toggle all the postings by 
pressing 'r'.

Pine can't do this.  If your using pine on a UNIX machine,
construct a file whose name is ".forward" with the following
line:

Prescription for generating a GPF from WinPine 3.91

- Logon to a very overloaded server
- get waiting for server messages after entering password

- List folders
- get waiting for server messages again (it didn't record the previous
  disconnection?)
- reply Y to disconnect from server after the 70-sec waiting period

Ah!  In that case just use the Unexclude command (&) ... it should be 
listed in the Command Menu at the bottom of the screen (although you may 
have to use the Other Commands (O) command in order to see it)

Sudden thought: I'm sure you know already, but you don't have to get it 
shown on the menu before you can use it.

Cheers,

This isn't exactly what you had in mind, but if you use vi as your
editor, define a macro to do it for you:

map ^Xc :%s/^>/:/^M

Variations are possible, such as changing all > characters that occur
prior to any character that is not a > and not whitespace, etc.

(To enter ^X, type ^V^X;  do likewise for ^M.)

If you do not like ctrl-x c, then you can change this to pretty much any
thing you like, well, any sequence of characters not otherwise usd by vi
(that is why I begin many of macros with ctrl-x:  vi does not use
ctrl-x).

A family member who uses PINE w/ an Inter net connection scans at least 
50 messages each day (replies to many of the posts).  This person has a 
physical disability and repetitive kb activity is stressful.

Is there mouse support for PINE?

If not, is mouse support for PINE-PC available?

Any help and/or suggestions will be appreciated.

Pls. send response to e-mail.  I do not have easy accessibility to the 
net and I do not want to miss any answers.

Press $

and then choose an order from the listed choices.
This is done within each news group.

You can also go into setup and change sort-order

S from main meny and then it is on one of the selection pages.

Please note your NNTP server is advertising itself as not properly
configured.  Also your return address is not valid.  The latter can
probably be fixed by setting an appropriate Netscape option.

   I would like to install Pine on HP with HPUX8.05 operating system,
   but I don't know what is the xxx code to build it. How you remember
   the xxx is the plataform where Pine is going to install.

Some of this information appears in the build script itself:

Usage: build <make-options> <target-platform>

<target-platform> may be one of the following:
    ult   Works on DECStations with Ultrix 4.1 or 4.2
    nxt   Works on NeXT 68030's and 68040's running Next Mach 2.0     
    sun   Works on SPARCs running SunOS 4.1
    ptx   Works on Sequent Symmetry running Dynix/PTX
    a32   Works on IBM RS/6000 running AIX 3.2
    ...   Others are available, see doc/pine-ports
  clean   Clean up object files and such.
	  Also, a good way to rebuild Pine/Pico from scratch.

Another clue is to look for makefile.xxx files in the pine and pico
subdirectories of the top-level distribution directory.  In your case,
reading makefile.hpp shows it is the

#     Make file for the Pine mail system for HPUX 8.0

Hello,

Thanks for a great mail system! 

But exploring the multiple possibilities offered by Pine I have hit 2 
walls, and I need your help to get through.
The first one concerns file attachments:
I have attached a Word Perfect file to a message I sent to a university 
email system and had no problems, but I also tried sending one to an 
institution which gets its email via mcimail.com and they just received 
garbage. I suppose it means that mcimail.com doesn't care about being 
MIME compliant, or maybe it means something else (I also emailed them an 
inquiry): can you help me determine the best options bearing in mind that 
I don't have a clue.

The second concerns extended ASCII characters such as an e with an accent 
on top:
I can upload an English text into a Pine message, but if I try to upload 
an ascii text file written in French, all the extended characters get 
stripped or misinterpreted. Can you help me find a solution for this 
(does some kind of filter/transposer exist ?)

I am sure you have received these types of questions many times and I 
apologize for the redundancy. I did try to find the answer to these 
problems in the online help, but somehow they eluded me. My web 
administrator hasn't found an answer either.

Many thanks,
Chris Travers

Yes, its easy.  You just open pico with "pico .foward", no quotes, in the 
directory of the one you wnat to foward. Type in the e-mail address that 
you want it fowarded to, close it, and that's it.

Have looked for a PINE FAQ, but can't seem to locate one. The Help files in
PINE don't seem to answer this question, either.

Right now, my sent-mail file lists sent mail "by sender". Would like to
have it list sent mail "by recipient". Tried changing what I thought was
the appropriate item near the bottom of of .pinerc, but it didn't seem to
make any difference. Is there another way to do this?

I was just hoping/wondering if PINE would ever learn how to read 
NeXTMail.  I don't get much, but when I do it is quite a hassle to unpack 
it by hand.  

I know there probably isn't a great need/demand for this, but it would be 
nice.  All it would really need to be was something which would uudecode, 
find the uudecoded file, and untar/uncompress it.

Just a thought.

Subject: Pine erroneously splitting 1 msg into 2 msgs, why?

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

I have noticed something which I believe is a misbehavior of the Pine 
mailer.

The following message, which was sent as one single message, is being
erroneously split into two messages by the Pine mailer running on a Sun
Unix system.  Pine is cutting off the message at the first "--02"
etc.  separator.  The second message starts with the header "Control:".

This message was created by the DARMAIL/PC mailer, and is supposed to be 
legal MIME syntax.

I believe this is legal, valid MIME syntax, and if so, the message should 
not have been stopped until the "--02"..."--" entry was reached, {which 
does appear in the end of the message}.

Is the message not in valid MIME format, (in which case the Darmail 
Mailer is in error), or is Pine failing to recognize it, (in which case 
Pine is at fault).  I can't see anything in the message which does not 
comply with all published RFCs and specifications, so I'm trying to 
figure out why Pine was splitting the message, terminating the first half 
at the point I indicated.  I am trying to find out if our program has 
done anything not in compliance with all published specifications for 
mail as specified in the RFCs.

The message appears below.

Yes.

I presume you mean, alt.religion.christianity.boston-church, and I'll use 
that as the example for this article.

HOWEVER, having gone and done this to see, I discover that is not the
correct name.  The correct name is alt.religion.christian.boston-church, 
and that is the one I'll use in the examples given here.

UUNET archives ALL newgroup/rmgroup postings for ALL newsgroups. (Since
1981 with one month missing in 1982, and ALL since 1983). If the newgroup
command was issued since 1983, the message doing so will be there.  If 
that message included the charter, then you can get it from that message.

You can pick up whatever has been issued for a newgroup command via ftp 
from UUNET using the following example:

ftp://ftp.uu.net/control/<hierarchy>/<hierarchy.name.of.group>.Z

Where "<hierarchy>" is the part of the name up through but not including 
the first period, e.g. alt,comp,bionet,tdr, etc.

And "<hierarchy.name.of.group>" is the full name of the group.  The .Z 
indicates that the file is compressed, and you need to use UNCOMPRESS to 
extract it as a text file.

So for that group, the file would be

<A HREF="ftp://ftp.uu.net/control/alt/alt.religion.christian.boston-church.Z>
ftp://ftp.uu.net/control/alt/alt.religion.christian.boston-church.Z</A>

I went over and picked it up.  Having read it, the item, "Any other topic
of discussion that focuses on the Church of Christ"  would seem to
indicate, since recruiting for a religious organization is discussion
focusing on that organization, that it would be a valid topic of
discussion for that group. 

Would recruiting for the Church of Scientology be valid in the group
dealing with issues regarding that organization be valid?  I would think
so.  Same for people attempting to recruit Christians in the appropriate
Christian groups, or people recruiting Muslims in groups supporting
various Muslim sects, or people recruiting Satanic worshipers in groups
relating to that subject.

For your newsgroups file:
alt.religion.christian.boston-church    The international Church of Christ.

[This newsgroup was proposed on alt.config on Saturday, February 19, 
1995.  There has been a considerable amount of discussion concerning the
organization known as the "Boston Church of Christ," evidencing the need 
for a its own newsgroup.  The majority of messages in the newsgroup 
creation discussion were in favor of its creation, with the only real 
point of contention being the name of the newsgroup itself.  The 
extension "boston-church" is under the 14-character limit for Usenet 
newsgroup names, and it seems to be the best phrase to bring the name 
"Boston Church of Christ" to the attention of the reader.]

Charter of the newsgroup:

Alt.religion.christian.boston-church is a Usenet newsgroup for discussion 
of the organization best known to the world at large as the "Boston 
Church of Christ."  This organization has subsidiaries in major cities 
across the United States and in other countries, such as London.  It also 
goes by the name of "International Church of Christ," though its Boston 
name is still widely used.

The actions of this organization have sparked a debate over whether this 
organization is, in fact, a "cult:" a group that attempts to influence 
and control the thoughts of its members.  Defenders of the Church 
of Christ deny this claim, saying that it is a religious study group.  
Critics of the organization have noted that the actions taken by the 
group to control its members and counter critics mirror the actions used 
by other alleged "cults" to silence criticism, including the suppression 
of the right to free speech.

One of the greatest advantages of the Internet is its (relatively) 
uncensored free speech.  There is no way to completely control a 
discussion in a Usenet newsgroup, which makes Usenet an ideal forum for 
the discussion of controversial subjects, such as alleged religious 
cults.  Hence the need for alt.religion.christian.boston-church.

Topics to be discussed on this forum include:

        - The difference between the Boston Church of Christ to
          other, similarly named "Churches of Christ."
        - The history of the organization and its leaders.
        - Attempts to contact members of the organization by
          friends and family members.
        - Alleged actions taken by the organization to silence
          or counter critics, and to silence those who have
          left the organization.
        - Statements by members of the Church of Christ on
          the fairness of accusations that their organization
          is a cult.
        - Any other topic of discussion that focuses on the
          Church of Christ.

In controversial discussions such as this one, distorted truths and lies 
are likely to be used by both sides of the argument.  The free speech of 
the Internet can be used to separate the truth from the lies, and reveal 
the truth about the organization known as the Boston Church of Christ.

I can't for the life of me get PINE to build on AIX 4.1.4.

Has anyone done this successfully?  I've tried using the a32 build, but
am getting nowhere.

Any source/file mods I need to make to get it to go?

	Well, pine can already do that....  Use the "|" to pipe the mail
to the process that you would normally execute by hand.

Create a .forward file in the area from where you want mails to be 
automatically forwarded and put in the email address of the account to 
which you want mails to be forwarded.

You will have to add the header "Return-Receipt-To:" in your Customised 
Header List. This can be done by going into Setup (Configure).

Now on invoking Rich Headers (^R), you can enter an email address where 
you will receive the receipt.

Yes, I know that.  However, I have to pipe it each time I read the 
message, which is annoying.  NeXT should have made a commandline binary a 
long time ago for reading NeXTMail, but they never did.

I have been a pine user on UNIX for a few years. Recently, I start to use 
PC-PINE. I tried downloading the mail folders back to my PC but I cannot 
use PC-PINE to read the saved mails. Is there convertion needed in order 
to read under PC-PINE? Can anyone please help me how to convert the

   You first might have to create a mailing-list in your pine
   address section, give it a name, and put it in the to: field
   when you want to send messages to the group of people.

I believe that you have to set your character set under setup to be 
iso-8859-1 which contains the International Standard Organization's

Hello & thanks in advance for your help,
When I name the file I have uploaded into my personal directory as an 
attachment, a file I created in Microsoft Word and saved as a text file, 
I get a message <Problem with attachments!> and if I send the mail 
anyway, there is a brief notice that the file is not in my directory.

I know that it is there, because when I open my personal file, it is 
named there and I can view it in its entirety.

What can I do to attach these files?  They are too long to copy & paste.

I am in need of some advice on how to delete the folders that I was able 
to create under Incoming Message Folders.  When I try to delete any of 
these created ones, Pine tells me that there're no such folders.  I was 
able to delete them after making files in my directory with the same 
names as the folders, but they always came back after I restart Pine.  I 
have two twin folders, i.e. two named SURVEY and two named TEST, and I 
can't seem to get rid of any of them.  Can someone please email me on how 
to go about fixing this problem.  Thanks

Is their any way for Pine to automatically delete messages from a certain 
address? i.e Mail Daemon set...I receive several rejected messages daily, 
and I just wanted to have Pine delete 'em. I know that a prog. called 
BeyondMail can do it..Thanks for any replies...

when send a mail by pine, how to set attachmnt file encoding format ?

For example, the recipient prefer to receive a file in uuencoded format,
or prefer to receive 8 bit banary codes (such as Chinese GB or BIG5)
without mpack or uuencode. Or they have to deal with mpacked files ?

Could you please reply to <zhang@block.ime.nrc.ca>

Dear Piners,
   Today (Feb 29th) we have had many people who run pine-3.89 crash on starting
up with a complaint about invalid msgno in some structure followed by a
floating point error.  With pine-3.91 I noticed that mail was sorted in
a particularly interesting way - it was to be sorted in reverse date.  All
day I saw the number of mail messages growing but I was a bit confused because
the top mail message was Feb 28.  Upon close examination I noticed that
messages dated Feb29th (and even one dated March 1 (from Australia) occured
below the Feb 28th messages.  Messages before Feb28th occured in the correct
order.  We are running this on Ultrix 4.4 system.

   I believe either a bug in pine or one in Ultrix 4.4 (ticked by pine) is the
cause of both of these problems.

   Anyone have similar problems?  If you know a fix please e-mail to:
   johnh@wheaton.edu

johnh...

No.

If you're on a Unix system, you will need to use the .forward feature and
the Procmail program to do this.  Try "man procmail" for more details.  I
have not been able to figure out how to get it to work, myself, but I know
some people have.  I wish I could, I could use the capability myself.

THERE ARE TWO WAYS YOU COULD DO THIS.  First, export the mail into a file 
and then edit it.  Then you could mail it back to yourself.  

Second, you could "FORWARD" the mail to yourself and then in that 
process,  block out and delete parts of the mail.  To block out sections 
of  the mail, press the control key and the ^ in sequence, so you have  
(ctrl-^), this blocks a section and then you can use ^K - cut text to 
chop it off.

I've just done that with your previous mail.

Cheers, Emmanuel.

......if you are using "attachment", why bother to convert to text to 
begin with. As long as it is "text", you can can use ^R to include it in 
the body of the message.  If you must use an attachment, be careful of 
the filename - if you are typing it recall the case matters to UNIX.  Try 
using ^T and then selecting the attachment instead of typing the name.  
My experience has been however, that attachment is best used only for 
binary files, use the ^R include for text - also helps out thee receiver 
if they are using an older mail handler.

If your pine is configured to enable suspension, you could also press
CTRL-Z to temporarily go into your unix shell, then after talking with
him/her, go back to pine by typing exit.  This way, you can come back 
right at where you left off...

    Pine will not do this for you.  You have to use some program which 
will pre-process the incoming mail before Pine gets hold of it.  On Unix 
systems, two commonly used pre-processors are procmail and filter.

that it shows at the unix prompt how many email you have in your pine.
What i mean..lets say I log in to my account and it says %(shell Prompt)
before that it usually says.."You have mail or you have new mail" is 
there a way it shows how many mail there is?

if anyone knows an answer I would appreciate it..
THanks in advance.

I think this is the address.. 

you send a message with body

www
send http://(url here)

and they will send you the info on that web page.

I have all the info about doing archie, ftp, www, gopher etc. through 
e-mail on my web page.  This may not be the right address since I have 
not used it in a long time.

Subject: dumb startup questions
Date: 27 Feb 1996 18:45:05 GMT
Message-Id: <4gvjfh$ekv@news.fsu.edu>

I have recently decided to start getting serious about using Pine,
especially since my newly upgraded (to Sun OS4.1.4) Openwindows mail
tool seems freaky. My initial questions are:

1. Is there a way to easily reformat my .mailrc aliases into
.addressbook?

2. Is there an easy way to use emacs in place of Pico?

3. I want to use folders already established in my ~/mail directory,
but when I use ~/mail it does not like that, and wants some kind of [
brackets. I put a [ in front of the path, and it seems to work ok, but
still complains. Putting the whole path in [] brackets does not seem
to work at all.

Most news-servers are not open for anyone to use. If you are in a 
different domain than the server this will probably be why you get
this error-message.

Greetings;
This is the first time I have tried this - hope is works!  I received a 
"talk" message tonight and didn't know what do either. I think maybe I'm 
getting the idea of how to respond.  But, how do you initiate a talk 
session?
All help will be gratefully accepted.
Thanks

Subject: How to fix READ-ONLY INBOX problem
Date: 4 Mar 1996 14:29:40 GMT
Message-Id: <4heuok$dfi@news2.cais.com>

1) You need to know where your inbox is: eg. /usr/mail/yourid or 
/var/mail/yourid and not the one in your home directory.  Your ISP can 
provide you with that information.

2) Once you know where your inbox is type:

chmod ug=rw /usr/mail/yourid

Which gives access to the user=u and group=g to read=r and write=w to 
/usr/mail/yourid.

Now, when you do an ls -al /usr/mail/userid you should get something like 
this:

-rw-rw----   1 youid     mail      111299 Mar  4 14:13 /usr/mail/yourid

You might also want to do this before the chmod statement, to see how things 
have changed.

I hope this helps.

Message-Id: <4heefh$3j2@muss.CIS.McMaster.CA>

Could someone please tell me how to do mail filtering? All I want to do 
is have email from mailing lists go to their own folders instead of the 
normal inbox. I tried typing "man procmail" at the unix prompt, but it 
says there is no entry for procmail, so I'm assuming my school doesn't 
have it installed. Is there any way to do this from Pine 3.91? Please CC 
your responses to me just so I don't miss it. Thanks.

Connie,

If you want to engage in the "talk" session, you need to quit Pine and go
to your shell prompt. Then, perform the "talk soandso@blah.blah.com"
command to connect with the person calling you. Yes, jot down the address 
because you might forget it backing out.

That's a function of your system, not Pine.  It's generally checked a login
using mail or mailx.  In scanning the man pages for both, I don't see a 
message count option.  Check with your system administrator, they may be 
able to help.

Hello,

As far as I understand the so called Internet PCs will have no hard disk
but you can use mail on them.  Will they be IMAP based ?

I get the above error when I try to send mail.  It then comes around

The mail was copied to the sent mail, but it did not get sent.

Any ideas?  Any help is appreciated

William, thanks for the information, but, when do I type "talk........"? 
Also, I was not familiar with the person who initiated the talk session, 
is there a way one can just do a "open" talk session ? I have only had my 
computer for about a month and on line for just a while longer than that 
through the university I attend, I admit, I am rather illiterate - but 
trying to learn.  Thanks for help.

 How can I setup pine to use an external POP3 server on an NTbox
 by default when picking up mail from one unix host? So say, someone
 runs pine and it goes out to the external pop3 server picksup the mail
copies it to the localhosts and users directory and thats done by default
for all pine users on this particular unix system. I want to basicly
eliminate the need for every of my systems to be doing pine and mail to
the outside world, i'd rather have a dedicated mailserver for all my systems
topickup mail from within pine.


thanks.

Using your favorite text editor, create a file (normally .signature in your
home directly) that has the info you want in the signature.  To find the 
file name that Pine expects, go into Setup/Config from the Main menu, and 
find the entry for signature-file.

I have two questions about pine.....

1. Is there any way to change the attribution for quoted text?  IOW,
instead of saying (at the top) "On 4 Mar 1996, Joe Foo wrote:", can I
change that to be something else?

2. Is there any way for pine to handle multiple .sig files?

Thanks,
Curt

Pine does not yet have *offline* support, which is what it sounds like you
want (that's download msgs and delete them from the server).  Pine does,
however, support *online* operation via IMAP so you can move the Pine
processing cycles safely to other machines.

 See RFC-1733 for definitions.
 See http://www.washington.edu/imap for info on IMAP.

Pine runs on AIX.  My workstation (actually a docked notebook computer)
runs OS/2 Warp Connect.  Warp connect has TCP/IP sevices built in.  I use
Pine in a telnet session on the AIX computer.  When I prYnt the output is
directed to the OS/2 spooling system and thence to the Deskjet 500
attached to the workstation.  Using the ansiprt command (AIX) in a telnet
session also results in the output being sent to the attached printer on
my workstation. 

This also works for prior versions of OS/2 and the TCP/IP support package 
for OS/2 from IBM, but I recommend Warp Connect.

I do not understand all the details (the standards that have been 
followed, for example), but needless to say I am delighted with the 
result.  It would seem that other combinations of OSs and TCP/IP support 
packages should also be able to achieve this functionality.  I have 
experience only with OS/2.

Is is possible in pine to take a received mail message and
post it to a newsgroup? It could be done by saving to a file
and then attaching the file to the posting, but is there a 
way to do it in less steps?

How are you connecting to your server?  It sounds like a keystroke map 
issue such as that in the Mac telnet.  You can disable the  normal 
program use of ^C so that the correct character gets to the unix server.

I notice UW uses Pine as an events calendar. Docs tell of special 
switches such as -nr used in conjunction with uwin. I set up a separate 
pine invocation using these switches and made pine read-only and looking 
very much like the events calendar. Except:

1) Dates are date message was sent, not date of event
2) Full headers appear in the messages.

I suspect there is a special file format used in conjunction with the 
events options, but I haven't found any specs for this on the ftp server.

I believe the "events calendar" uses a standard Berkeley format
folder, but the messages are edited manually to have the desired
headers/dates, etc.

hi...

I have several people using pop mail on a sun 4/280 running sunos4.1.3.
It's stable and I don't want to mess it up   :-)

To accomodate those who want to run Pine on other machines but collect
mail from this sun (ie, they're not going to run Pine on the sun), can I
simply get imapd-bin.sun.Z from ftp.cac.washington.edu, expand it and
put it in place?? Will it then respond to mail "queries" from users who
set up this sun as a remote folder host (since they can already
successfully get pop mail from it) ??

I'd love it if it were so simple...

replies to   <thf@pvs.k12.nm.us>   much appreciated

tom

Have people managed to compile Pine under Linux ELF (kernel 1.3.71, gcc 
2.7.0, libc 5.2.12). I get the following error when compiling the IMAP 
client, file os_lnx.c:

In file included from /usr/include/linux/socket.h:6,
                 from /usr/include/sys/socket.h:5,
                 from os_lnx.c:42:
/usr/include/linux/uio.h:18: redefinition of `struct iovec'

I have already applied the patch from the Infomagic CDROM (aug'95) for 
Linux ELF. I have no problems compiling either Pine (doesn't link) or 
Pico.

Kind regards,

Kees de Bruin

ANY message you receive (or indeed compose) can be sent using e-mail, 
Usenet News or both.

When you forward, reply-to or compose your article ONE of the two headers 
"To:" or "Newsgroups:" will be completed (depending on whether Pine 
thinks you are currently reading mail or news).

If you leave things like this the message will be sent ONLY to that 
collection of people (the person being e-mailed (EXCLUSIVE-)OR the 
newsgroup).

However you can quite easily put the cursor on any header line and type 
^R (Rich Headers) to see *all* the available headers.  Thus you can add a 
"To:" (e-mail address) to a Usenet News article or a "Newsgroups:" list 
to an e-mail message and have the result simultaneously to both e-mail 
and News.

In your particular case....

1.  View the e-mail message you have received.
2.  Use "F" to start a "Forward".
3.  Use ^R to show all headers and fill in the newsgroup name(s) in the
    "Newsgroups:" header field.
4.  Fill in the "To:" field as well only if you want a copy e-mailing to 
    someone too.
5.  Modify the Subject and message text as appropriate.
6.  Send.

Cheers,

Mike Brudenell                                         <pmb1@york.ac.uk>

Hi again,

	I have the following peculiar situation: I have got two machines
running Solaris 2.4 and pine 3.91jh803 on both systems (with your patch
in it). The only difference is that on one system is running
IDA sendmail and on the other sendmail v8.7.4. When I send a mail from the
second system with 8-bit chars inside and when it asks me to choose
between Mime or Normal sending (letters M or Y) I press Y.

	However the message arrives MIME encoded and I also I can see
at the bottom of the pine screen that MIME method is used. Could you
please tell me how pine decides not to use the simple 8-bit char sending
and it prefers to disobey my 'Y' request?

	I do not think that it has to do with sendmail itself as
when I send the message with the greek chars by using "Mail -v dimakop@.."
then they arrive at the other end (where IDA sendmail is running)
not encoded in MIME.

Thank you,

Subject: VAX/VMS installation help needed

I have a Microvax II running VAX/VMS 5.4-2 and Multinet 3.2(i think that's
the version).  I cannot find any vms files on the washington machine, unless
they are in the .Z file.  If so, then how do I unpack that file?  Or am I
missing something along the way?

thanks in advance

You can also try putting one of these in your .login (or whatever):

frm         -- shows who mail is from and the subject
from        -- basically the same as the above
messages    -- will say 'There are 5 messages in your mailbox'

good luck!

Message-Id: <313d0b08.12311202@news.efn.org>

I'm going to be using Linux to connect via a PPP connection, and I'm
wondering if there's some way I can use Pine to connect to my host and
dl my mail?  I've had no problem using it to send mail thru my host,
and have used it to read the news - but I can't seem to figure out how
to configure it for this.

Many thanks...

And what happens if you continue to be logged in past midnight? Wrong date! :-(

Personally I'd include the date with an editor command.
With vi this is as easy as ":r!date".
This can easily be mapped to ",," with ":map ,, :r!date".

But why bother?  The date is in the "Date:" header line, anyway!

I am running 3.91 on AIX 3.2.5.  I have found that dead pine processes
eat CPU time a lot and slow my system down.  I am talking in the hundreds
and thousands of minutes.  I suspect that my users are turning their  
machines off while pine is still running.  Any one else notice this?

Keeping this file up-todate requires that *every* mail that comes in has to be
checked.  This is a lot of work which requires a person to read all day.
Well, I won't pay money for someone to read my mail.

Besides, what about my right to receive spam mails if I want them?
Furthermore, why should someone else decide which mail will not get?
And what happens if that person comes up with a spamfile rule that says
"delete every mail that contains the word 'and'"?

				No way!!

Btw, you forgot to add your "CDA supporter signature".  HTH.

I am using Pine 3.91 with the Zmodem communications program. My system is
MAC. When someone sends me attachments, other than plain text (e.g., MS
Word), Pine just lists them. It won't allow the attachments to be viewed
("V" command). After using the "S" comand, nothing was sent to my computer.

I need to somehow to save or transfer the attachments to my MAC so they
are usable. Please, give me explicit instructions, as I am not experienced
either with ZModem or UNIX. I am familiar with changing Pine setup
configuration, however. 

Thanks, Dan

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Hi! I've just tried out using Pine with the Elm filter program. So far it 
works ok.. I just have a question about having several inboxes.. I've 
enabled the "enable-incoming-folders" function and created another folder 
called "Pine" to store my incoming mailing list emails. 

The elm filter program that i'm using contains a rule to save any 
incoming email with the 'to' header containing 'pine-info' to a folder 
called "Pine"

However when I checked my folders, I found that there's another "Pine" 
folder created in the 

Folder-collection <mail/[]>  ** Default for Saves **

section. Hence I have 2 "Pine" folders... one in the incoming and another 
in the folder-collection. Can anyone help/advise so that the incoming 
email will be processed and sent to the "Pine" folder in the incoming 
section. Thanks for your help

Aaron Aw

I do just what you are talking about by using Procmail to filter my
mail. It keeps a log of each piece of mail. It also comes with shell
script to tell where the new mail has been filtered into. Everytime I
log in I get a message saying 

size   #    folder
2013   5    /usr/mail/spool/username
1045   1    procmail
900    1    tubaeuph


	I then know how many and where they were filtered into. Check
out www pages on procmail.

Thanks for the info.  Unfortunately, my system gurus won't let me touch 
my .newsrc file.

I just thought it would be nice if I could have an alias name for a 
newsgroup that would appear on the screen.  If I have someone sitting 
next to me while I'm using Pine, I'd rather they not find out that I 
subscribe to alt.fetish.elbows or alt.naughty.stuff.

    In Unix Pine, anyway, you can manually edit your .newsrc file (be

add a new group, it usually goes to the bottom of the heap, but if I

careful when editing this file -- it is a critical one.)

    Uhh, why would you want to?  So far as I know, the name of a
newsgroup in the folder list *is* the name of the newsgroup and has to
be, or else the reader can't find the group.

Hi..I don't know if I have emailed this newsgroup before ...but 
anyways...I will try to explain again....
Somone on this newsgroup said that you can put current date (automatically)
before your signature..and they have said that you have to rename your 
.signature to anoter fiel name..so I did ..and called it .signatured.
and deleted .signature.
When I tried it ..(composed an email) it worked fine..it showed the 
current date..but when i Log in at another time. (after I log out) after 
it logs in it says .signature already exists...and when i compose an 
email it writes my signature twice. so when i log off and log on again..
and try to compose it write my sinature 3 times...and so on..
I don't know what to do...or what is wrong..i hope this info help..below 
there are more info...
read-message-folder    = <No Value Set>
signature-file         = .signatured
global-address-book    = <No Value Set>
address-book           = <No Value Set: using .addressbook>

           [ ]  signature-at-bottom

where it says [ ] signature-at-bottom should i make it X?
anyresponse I would appreciate...and also is it possible to make it time 
sensitive? Can it show the current time also before the signature?
Since I'm asking alot of questions..I should ask this question also..I 
downloaded the promail..now I don't know what to do with it..my unix 
account didn't have procmail..here is the file name that I downloaed it..
procmail-3.10.tar.gz can someone tell me the steps the i should take?
in details? I would Really appreciate it..I'm making an Mailing list for 
an student association and all the help I get I would appreciate it....

Vartan

Sorry if this is a stupid question...but is there any way to set up a 
PINE killfile?

Just save it when in the View Attachment menu. It'll be converted.

Pine 3.91 does not support kill files.

Sorry but it does have to do with sendmail. When sendmail 8.7.* series
gets a MIME formated eight-bit message, it checks the next end if it
supports 8BITMIME mode (IDA does not) and if not, it converts everything
to Quoted-Printable or Base64. It is the supposed and wanted behaviour.=20
If it does such things for non-MIME eight-bit messages depends on
configuration options. One solution is to upgrade to sendmail 8.7.4 from
IDA.=20

Hi,

	I am trying to read news groups which have 8-bit chars inside
(greek characters). However the news articles arrive in 8-bit encoding
and not in MIME. With a configuration with some tools that I have set
I have managed to send MIME messages to news groups but when I try to
read them with pine then I see the original MIME article unencoded.

	So my question is if pine as a news reader can post and read
MIME UseNet news articles.


	If not, could anybody suggest any MIME news reader?

Thanks.

Using Tin:

When you post a followup, the default is mail to the newsgroup and reply 
to the person to.

Using Pine:

When posting a followup, if you say 'y' to *Post to Newsgroup*, the 
message gets posted to the newsgroup and does not get mailed. If you say 
'n' then the message is mailed and not posted. Of course, you can change 
this by actually editing the headers, so that the message gets posted and 
mailed!!

If you use Pine for news reading/posting too, then you could just forward 
the mail and fill in the newsgroup in the header so that the message is 
posted to a newsgroup rather than mailed.

It took a bit, but I found the answer in the pico man page:  set the
environment variable SPELL to the name of an external spelling checker
which reads stdin and writes to stdout.

Sadly, this is not the most useful way of doing things:  IWBNI pico
could pass the spell checker a file, then suck that file back in once
the spell checker exited successfully.

Sorry, you can't (else, you could set up your self as the "postmaster"
for example).

Ask your system administrator to create an alias for you (only that
person can usually create machine-global aliases, and they have
nothing to do with pine).

Date: 6 Mar 1996 20:08:00 -0500
Message-Id: <4hlctg$4l3@zip.io.org>

I run Linux at home and use Pine here to get to my mail on a few
different sites that are slow to connect to and often have high system
loads.  It's a lot faster that way, especially being able to edit
locally.  However, this gives me the following problem:

When I reply to mail that's been sent to my home machine, the From:
address plugged in is correct.  But when I reply to mail that's been
sent to foo.com, it also plugs in my home address, not my foo.com
address.

Is there some way I can associate different e-mail addresses with the
different inboxes I'm accessing?  A friend suggested I use different
.pinercs, but this means I have to either quit Pine and restart it or
run two copies at once.


Thanks for any help,

Bill Denton

I am trying to post and read UseNet News articles with greek chars
(8-bit chars) using pine. However they arrive to the group as 8 bit
chars and not in MIME encoding. I also have made a configuration 
which, eventually posts an article encoded in MIME. When I try to
read it by using pine I see the MIME chars and not the original
message.

Does this mean that MIME does not suupport MIME encoding/decoding 
in news reading?

If I am right ould somebody suggest a MIME newsreader?

Thank you,

Select the category called 'customized headers' and enter

is highlighted, you can type '?' to get help from Pine.
Let me know if this works.

Hi

I've emailed the university and gotten no response.

I want to do the Windows GUI and put it in the public domain; but I would

Can someone suggest where/how to get this ? To join in as a participating

Hello,

I am facing a little problem viewing "comments" from my homepages. I can 
see the comments by using elm mailer but when i use pine(3.90) i get the 
following after the heading:

[Part 1, application/X-WWW-FORM-URLENCODED 82 BYTES]
[Cannot display this part, Use the "V" command to save in a file]

So i  followed the instruction and typed in the 'V' command and wrote it 
in a file and tried to view it without any luck.

My question is:

1.Why can't i view the "comments" mailed from my html "comments" page 
using pine?
2.In order to make pine view "comments" that comes from my html pages, 
what configuration i have to do to pine and how?
3. How can i view the same mail using elm but not pine?

If anybody can shed some light on this matter, and can possibly enlighten 
me on this matter i would be most obliged and greatful. If the answer 
exists in the web or on some ftp site, please provide me with such address.
Please accept my sincere thanks in advance on this matter.

Thank you.

Since pine does not support the use of a killfile, I've been marking 
messages with specific words in their subject, deleting the marked 
messages, and then excluding the deleted messages.  My question:  How can 
I record the key sequences so that I don't have to repeat them everytime 
I enter a newsgroup.  I want to just press one key (i.e. Macro) and 
delete all the pertaining files?

Thanks for you help,

Michael Zawacki

No, that's how you change the order of MESSAGES within newsgroups, not 
the order of the newsgroups on the folder list screen.  As far as I know, 
you can't change the order in which the newsgroups are presented in the 
folder list.  Does anyone else know if this can be done?

I'd also like to know if it's possible to change the name of a newsgroup 
as it appears on my folder list.

Was the protection of /tmp changed recently?  It should be protected 1777.
A global readonly suggests that either /tmp is inaccessible, or (SVR4
systems) that the statd/lockd daemons collapsed.  Since you say NFS isn't
involved, I would tend to suspect /tmp since statd/lockd are NFS critters.

When composing a message the help screen indicates that:

"Pine can call an external spell checking program to look over the message
you are composing.  By default, Pine uses the simple Unix spell checker."

So if by default, Pine uses the simple Unix spell checker, how can I 
change this default AND/OR specify my own alternate dictionary for words 
not found in the main dictionary list.  I can see nothing in SETUP CONFIG 
that tells how to do this or how to specify a non-default spell checker.  
I hope I wouldn't have to do this via compile time switches.

I am using Pine V3.91

    No.  In its current version (3.91), Pine merely acts to let you
read mail that has already been delivered.  You need a utility which
will act on (e.g., kill) incoming mail before Pine gets hold of it.  On
Unix systems, two common such programs for filtering mail are procmail
and filter.  You can get information on (Unix) mail filtering from
Nancy McGough's Web pages, which you can get to from my home page. 
(You have to thread your way several levels deep.)

	As to the multiple .sigs, it's easy. Suspend (or get out of) pine 
to your unix shell. Command pico sig.xyz (this'll turn out more 
convenient that xyz.sig, which scatters things all over the alphabet), 
and write a .sig, using the cues at the bottom of the screen. When you've 
stored it, command pico sig.xyz again (to save rekeying) and modify it; 
this time, when it offers sig.xyz as the file to store to, overwrite and 
create sig.qkj; and so on.
	Back in pine, use whatever you want as your default .sig in the 
setup/configure memo -- such as, at the moment:

R.R. "Beartooth" Neuswanger             Death is not evil.
rrne@loc.gov                            Suffering is evil.
                   I speak for me. Only.

	Then, when you want a different one, delete the default, and at 
the bottom of your message, hit control-R, and fill in sig.qkj or 
whatever. Some examples:

R.R. Neuswanger, Ph.D., NRA life        Death is not evil.
rrne@loc.gov                            Suffering is evil.

	Hi all!

	I'd like to know if it's possible to use PC Pine for Windows not 
beeing connected to the Internet.
	I use Pine at the University and due to large amount of mail 
received I'd like to take the mail folders home and read them there. The 
problem is that after intalation PS Pine refuses to open any folder 'cos 
it doesn't find the connection to a net server... It creates a "mail" 
folder on the root disk, but doesn't read anything I put there.
	I've tried to configure it but acheived no success in all the 
attempts made.

	Thanks in advcance.

Hi all,
Didn't get an answer to this question in an earlier post, so will try it again: 

How does one change the To: identification in PINE's sent-mail folder. Right
now, PINE displays my email address in the listings. I want it to display the
e-mail addresses of the addressees. There is obviously something in the
.pinerec or in the setup but can't seem to identify the correct item to change.
Please help! :-)

Message-Id: <4hnuj0$4ma@yantra.anyware-fast.com>

Things almost work with this combination except messages seem to get
munged if there's more than about 3 messages in the server mailbox.
mtest returns broken message bodies.

The QUALCOMM server string is;

QUALCOMM Pop server derived from UCB (version 2.1.4-R3) at [my isp] starting.

I'm not sure what brand of Unix my ISP is running.

My current workaround is to slurp over the mailbox with popclient, then
read and send email locally with pine.  But it would be nice to have all
this done inside pine.

Is anyone else out there successfully running this combo?

Dear all,
I have a problem, can you get Pine to read mail from a POP
server????? I read some of the articles on the newsgroup and
there was an implication that you could, so i went to browse
the faq documents, to read that you can't. I am confused!
What i want to do is run Pine on my unix account but to get
my mail from my Novell account, so i don't have to quite
exceed every time i want to check my mail. It is possible to
get mail from the Novell machine by POP as this is what i do
when i dialup from home via PPP, using Pegasus mail.

Any help on configuration, or pointers to useful docs would
be gratefully accepted!

Cheers

Neil

	Is there any way to have Pine run a program/scipt/whatever every

This is a known bug in Pine 3.91's POP code, and is fixed in the
forthcoming Pine 3.92 release.

We recommend the usage of IMAP instead of POP.

Subject: Cutting and Pasting w/ Pico?
Date: 5 Mar 1996 07:07:44 GMT
Message-Id: <4hgp80$blo@peabody.colorado.edu>

I was wondering if anybody knows if it is possible to cut text out of pico
and insert the cut text in a new file.  I know the round-about way to do
this is to remove all the text you *don't* want, and then save the rest to
a file, but this is sort of time consuming. 

I checked the faq at the washington web site, and they make only a passing
reference to pasting (cutting addresses from the Pine address book), and
they make no mention of using Pico in this context.  (I've also asked the 
local help desk about twenty times ;).

What I really need to know is if it is possible or not.  If it's not
possible, I'll stop banging my head looking for a way ;).  I have a Unix
account (System V, Rel 4), but I'm sort of (very) new to Unix.  In the
process of trying to figure out how to do this, I learned kooky (to me-I 
was a Dos user ;) Unix commands like bg, fg, ps and the like.

I have tried the following (both of which don't work):

-Having two sessions of my account up, running a pico in each, cutting 
 the text in one and pasting in the other.
-Running one pico (with -z), cutting, suspending, opening another pico,
 and pasting.

Perhaps my trying the previous methods shows my Unix ignorance, but like I
said, I'm new to Unix.  Anyway, if this isn't possible, is there any
chance it would be included in a future version (the 'new feature' list
made no mention of this...)?

Thanks in advance for any help....

Dear sirs....
how can you have pine attach an automatic footer (like my name and 
mailing address) at the bottom of every e-mail I compose. There exists no 
literature on pine here at UCLA, so it's all trial and error. I would 
very much apprecite some help. Thank you.

Not sure if the will work how you want it to, but try the following:

In Setup/Config, make sure that enable-alternate-editor-implicitly is 
set, and that editor is set to the script that contains the command 
you want to execute, as well as your editor command, such as:

editor                 = news.edit  

where news.edit is an executable script such as the following:

fortune>>$1
your-editor $1

I have been trying to print using Procomm Plus 2.1 for Windows to an attached
Hewlett Packard LaserJet 4L printer.  Unfortunately pine and this printer don't
seem to want to peacefully coexist.  When I send the exact same print job to
a network printer the HP 5L however, it prints out flawlessly.  Both printers
have correctly installed print drivers, and I am not changing any of the
Procomm settings *except* for the printer choice in the print setup box.
I would greatly appreciate any suggestions!

Subject: SOLUTION: compiling pine on solaris 2.4
Message-Id: <1996Mar8.164238.20288@imec.be>
Date: Fri, 8 Mar 1996 16:42:38 GMT


I had quite some problems compiling pine 3.91 on solaris 2.4
I am/was not the only one since I have seen quite some postings about the
same problem, but I never saw any answer.

Apparently the solaris support in the makefiles works only on solaris 2.2
(also the pre-compiled binaries on ftp.cac.washington.edu are solaris 2.2)
I tried all sorts of combinations (cc5.sol, gcc, ..) but all to no avail:
  imap, mtest and pico compiled -- be it with a lot of warnings -- 
    but pine simply wouldn't.

Carefull examination of the compiler error showed that the problem was 
not in the pine code, but in the the include files stdio.h, stdlib.h and
unistd.h : redefinition of functions (eg getopt).
Examining those files showed that if __STDC__ was defined, the functions
were defined twice if some other compile conditions were met.
Reading the man page for cc showed the magic cc option: -Xs

The solution: modify makefile.sol in both the pico and pine directories
    - define LDCC as cc (forget about using cc5.sol) :   LDCC= cc
    - add -Xs to CFLAGS

I bet that someone who is used to compile stuff on solaris 2.4 could have
solved this problem in a fraction of the time I needed. But since I did not
find any answer in this or other newsgroups ...

Happy compiling.

Eddy

I had that problem when I first started using Pine!  Try paging to the end
of the document with your space bar and then highlighting from the bottom
up.  It sounds crazy but it works for my configuration.

I'm using Pine 3.91 on Solaris 2.5.  For some reason, *all* of my users 
inboxes (500 of them) are suddenly being flagged as locked/read-only 
when accessed by Pine.  Users are unable to delete messages.  Access by 
Eudora is normal with users able to remove mail from their inboxes.   
Inspection of the /var/mail dir -> all appears normal.  This is a local 
dir, not a NFS.

What's happening here?

Thanks, tony pajas

I can't make any generalizations (or announcements), but I've been told

Eddy,
I read your recent message on Pine configurations with a lot of interest.

Would you please tell me how I can get the Pine Manual that shows 
configuration possibilities?

My server uses UNIX _ SunOS Release 4.1.3_U1 SCLS #1_.

Can you easily explain to a novice what all that means?

There was an old libpico.a in the pico/ dir so I removed it and then Pico com-
piled ok...
It did mention however:

bfd assertion fail /opt/release/pub/bin/binutils/bfd/elfcode.h:4716
bfd assertion fail /opt/release/pub/bin/binutils/bfd/elf32-i386.c:624

But in generated an executable..

Any help here would be very much appreciated!

Thanx

Ray

I have found it possible to mark one page of text with the mouse, but if 
the message is two pages long one has to save it twice to copy to file or

What do you mean, they won't let you touch your .newsrc file???  You have 
to have both read and write access to it so that pine can update it to 
keep track of which articles you've read.  In principle, you should be 
able to edit your .newsrc file just like any other text file.

However, it is *not* a good idea to use pico to do this, because 
.newsrc files tend to have long lines which must be kept intact (even if 
you do move them around), and pico likes to break long lines into shorter 
ones.  So, unless you're familiar with vi or some other editor that 
doesn't mess with long lines, you'd best leave your .newsrc alone.

I have been receiving a few mime encoded (base 64) messages and pine 
doesn't interpret them correctly. Does someone know the way in which a 
mime encoded file needs to appear to be properly readable?

I've also extracted the message into a file and tried to use munpack on 
it to decode it, but that still doesn't. If anyone can offer help in 
the way in which mime encodes, I'd appreciate it. Please e-mail me 
directly if you can help. Thanks in advance.

Most Unix systems have a program called ispell, which is a good,
interactive spell checker program that allows one to add words to a
custom dictionary.  The only "trick" is to get Pine to use ispell.

Here's an easy way:  go into the Pine configuration screen and turn on
enable-alternate-editor-cmd.  Then, after you have composed your
message, hit CTRL+_ (that is, hold down the control key and hit the
underline -- remember to get the underline you need to hold down the
shift key, so you're actually holding down both the control key and the
shift key).  This will pop up the question "Which alternate editor?"
Type ispell (and hit enter) and the ispell program will spell check
your message, and allow you to make corrections and add words to your
personal dictionary.

By the way, this method also lets you use other editors besides pico for
composing your e-mail.  For example, I prefer to use the vi editor.  So,
when I compose a message, after I've filled in the header information, I
hit CTRL+_, then type vi (and hit enter), compose my message in vi, exit
vi using the usual vi command (:wq), hit CTRL+_ again, then type ispell
to spell check it.

Hope this helps.

Yup, you can rearrange your .newsrc file with a text editor as Paul sez, 
but also as he sez, be careful.  A tip which I hope may be helpful ... I 
usually prefer to arrange them in alphabetical (actually alphanumeric) 
order, and there's a simple unix command to do this.  As Paul sez, new 
groups go to the bottom of the heap.  To put it all in alpha... order, 
type at a unix prompt:  sort -o .newsrc .newsrc

The -o is an 'ordered sort' in unix.  Now again, be careful, and as 
George Bush said, "read my lips" ... From a unix prompt you type:

s o r t space minus o space dot n e w s r c space dot n e w s r c enter

If you want something other than alphabetic order, you can use an editor 
such as pico or vi.   Hope this helps.  BYE.

Hhmmmm ... I doubt if lynx (or pico) has benn configured to deny access to
dot files.  Try this:  From lynx, go to pico, then ^R (control + r) to
read in a file, then what yer probably doing is going ^T to get to a file
list and you can't see the .files ??  Well yer not supposed to, that's to
prevent an uniformed user from accidenatally deleting or editing a
.dotfile.  So instead of typing ^R then ^T, type ^R then .newsrc or
whatever .filename you want to (^R)eadIn.  Only a thought ... hope this
helps.  BYE.

Geoff,
As I mentioned in my response to you a couple of months ago, the 3.92
source is not quite ready yet, and that's the version you want to look at
since it already has quite a few GUI amenities.  So stay tuned, it
won't be much longer...

(Also just fyi: Pine source code is not in the public domain; it is
copyrighted by the University of Washington, and Pine is a registered
trademark of UW.)

That works great!  It also resolves the problem of bad highlighting in the

  "ARRIVES".
  Returning a receipt when an e-mail gets READ is considered by some
people an intrusion of privacy.
  "Why do I have to tell you whehter I've read your e-mail?!!" ;-)

  Hope this helps.

Yes, I knew the latter; same deal with Eudora light. It is just that I am
particularly good on GUI design and layout as well being a top-notch
Windows developer, and I want to make PC Pine look super slick as well as
adding in a loadable crypto module. I am a great believer in public ware
and actively develop Linux (amongst other things).

I have a break between a job right at the moment and want to tackle this
while I am blessed with time. This is the sort of thing I want and like to
do. Everything else is what I have to to do :-(.

I write in C and 8086 asm, so you get clean, fast code as opposed to VB or
some of the kludge out there...

Is there someway you can fix me up with an experimental IMAP email account
I can start pointing an IMAP client to in the meantime ?
geoff@cac.washington.edu or similar perhaps ?  Also, what is your phone
number ? I am coming to the States and would like to catch up some time.


Cheers, Geoff.

If you are using a PC, you may find it easier to visit Forte.com and download

and you will see a split screen with a message at the top saying "no connection

Can anyone answer this question:  I have a friend who's on a CMS-based 
system, and I'm on a Unix-based system, and our "talk" daemons won't 
communicate.  Do you know what we can do to have realtime chats with some 
version of "talk"?  I'd prefer "talk" to irc.  

I'd also appreciate an email reply since I don't get to read these 
newsgroups much.

Thanks, 
Kate

   Hello!

   We are traslating Pine and we have problems to recompile it for DOS 
because of the compiler we are using. 

  Can anybody tell us which compiler we must use? 

  We had tried: Borland C++ (until 4.0 version) and Microsoft C (until 
7.0 version). We know that Visual C++ had problems with this code, too...

  Thanks for all.

Have you tried asking you local "help-desk"?

nntp.hia.no

>news-colletions=? Not here either!

Try reading your pinerc-file, or trying the help-function.
A simple way is:
NEWS *{nntp.hia.no/nntp}[]
but that way you do not separate the newsgroups at all, I
leave the rest for you to find out.

You could make a .signature file!!!!
This is very easy to make simply go into telnet or simular mailprogram,
then use Pico or emacs or a common texteditor and make a file.
Save it as .signature, then go into pine setup and find a line signature 
file= ....fill in with .signature.
Now this signature will be added in every letter you send!!!!
You might have look into setup in Pine, to find a command that allows you 
to include the signature at the bottom of the letter

it sounds like your home directory is not +r ...

you have to do chmod +r <full path name to your home directory>

that should work.

You may be confusing different implementations of PINE for VMS.  One 
is a commercial product which you would purchase.  AFAIK you don't get 
it on the net.

The one that we use is a free version, by Yehavi Bourvine in Israel.
It has some shortcomings, but it mostly does what we want.

>we don't have WWW where I work.

Well, then you're working with at least one hand tied behind your
back.  Lynx, at least, exists in a VMS version: get it and use it
(look on comp.infosystems.www.browsers.misc for an FAQ, ask there
if you need further help).

The only information I can offer you about Yehavi's VMS PINE
is on a WWW page:

http://ppewww.ph.gla.ac.uk/%7Eflavell/vms-pine.html

The software is available for FTP (user "anonymous") at vms.huji.ac.il
in directory LOCAL as PINE_3_*.ZIP (for appropriate value of "*"), 
you also need UNZIP.EXE in order to unwrap it.

Is there a way to change the Pine configuration to use a different
return e-mail address "username" (i.e.,username@domain...)??
This is needed when an alias e-mail domain is used.  Thanks!

Message-Id: <kbruland.826333618@beaker>


Hi Everyone,

I have been running Pine 3.91 with NetBSD 1.0 for a while with no problems.

Recently I upgraded to NetBSD 1.1, and pine stopped working.  I recompiled
it but this did not help.

Pine won't even start.  I get the error message "Can't access terminal or
input is not a terminal.  Redirection of standard input is not allowed.
For example "Pine < file" doesn't work."

Has anyone managed to fix this yet?  After looking through the source, the
error is probably somewhere in the Raw() function in ttyin.c, but I haven't
had time to work on it.

Thanks in advance,

Kris Bruland

    These remarks apply *only* if you are running Unix Pine.  Change to
your home directory and enter  ls -l .add*  .  Your should see a file
called .addressbook and possibly one called .addressbook.lu , which is
an index file to make the addressbook function more efficient.  Because
these file names begin with a period, you do not see them in an
ordinaty listing.

Recently I tried compiling PINE v3.91 for OpenVMS Alpha v6.2, running UCX v4.0.
It compiled OK (a few warnings, but at the very least Pico runs flawlessly),
but now I want it to read PINE.CONF.  It says "No host name or domain name
set", but the first thing I have defined in PINE.CONF is the host name.

My PINE.CONF (preliminary):

user-domain =bruin.adelphi.edu
smtp-server=bruin.adelphi.edu
image-viewer=xv
inbox-path=NEWMAIL

The README.VMS says it looks in UTIL$, but I have UTIL$ defined properly and
it's pointing to the right directory, but no luck.

Greetings: I have recently installed your pine system on a new RS6000 AIX 
system. I have both a pine.conf and pine.conf.fixed file in 
/usr/local/lib. Whenever I run pine I get the usual message about moving 
my current sent-mail to one with the month added to it. No matter whether 
I say yes to save or no not to save, I keep getting the same question 
everytime I start a new pine session about saving and moving the 
sent-mail file. Can you tell me what I might be doing wrong or have an 
incorrect setup in either of my two above mentioned control files?

2. Also when I quit pine I get the message about some of my current 
options differ from the system ones. I assume this is only a warning but 
I don't think I should get it everytime I quit pine. Can you think of any 
reason for this?

I have deleted my own .pinerc file and therefore pine should pick up a new
copy from /usr/local/lib and therefore there should not be any differences. 

I have included my two files below.

Thanks

Jim

Subject: Pine 3.91 on SCO Unix - Problem with attachments
Date: 11 Mar 1996 22:26:34 GMT
Message-Id: <4i29aq$k2h@reader2.ix.netcom.com>

We are running SCO Open Server Enterprise 3.0.0 using MMDF as a
transport agent with a UUCP connection to ATTMAIL. We are not running
TCP/IP. I recently downloaded and installed the Pine 3.91 binaries for
SCO Unix from celestial.com.  This is my first experience with Pine.

Here's my problem. Whenever I send an attachment to the local machine
from the Net (using Netcruiser or Netscape), the attachment seems to
get truncated.  The MIME header shows that the content length is 2559
bytes but I only get 100 or so. Pine does not recognize the attachment.
If I send an attachment from the local machine to someone on the Net it
goes through fine. If I send an attachment from the local machine to
another local user, it is sent and received fine. The only problem
seems to be going from the Net to the local machine. 

I have searched the tech notes at U of Washington and the SCO manuals
but I can't find a solution. Thanks in advance for any help that you
might be able to render.

Message-Id: <courcoul-0703961637590001@trantor.qro.itesm.mx>

I need to customize and rebuild Pine, to run on a SparcStation with
Solaris 2.4. Doing a 'build sol' is a no-go; pico and imap build fine, 
but pine bombs out. Closer inspection of the makefiles and the osdep/os-*
files shows that they're for Solaris 2.2.

Would some kind soul have a set of customized makefile.sol and osdep/*
files willing to share ? 

TIA for your help !

It's a file in your home directory, the filename is '.addressbook'   
Don't forget the . in front!   Hope this helps.  BYE.

Not directly, but you could mail it to yourself.

Use S to (s)ave, not E to (e)xport, they will be saved in a folder name 
'saved-messages', although you can change that.

Hey everyone,

I'd like to be able to sort the messages in my newsgroups by thread.  
Ordered Subject works to a point, but it doesn't then sort the messages 
by date within the ordered subject.  Is there any way to do this?

Thanks!  :)

Chuck,

Check out August issue of Linux Gazette at http://www.tenn.com/fiskhtml/
gazette_toc.html This has a very detailed explanation of using Pine+pop 
and changing the From: field. I know you will find it very helpful.

I am having problems with invalid mailbox format messages do you 
know anything about this?

I mistakenly saved a number of old messages to a unix system file using

What is the best way to store your old messages so that they can be

That's a bit labour intensive (where "labour intensive" is defined as
having to do anymore that absolutely necessary).  Try the following vi
macro:

    % grep ispell ~/.exrc
    map S :w:!ispell %:e %

Edit the file in vi, hit escape to get back to command mode (as you
would prior to entering :wq), hit S to spell check the file, then enter
:wq to quit vi and return to pico/pine.

Note:  ^M is entered using vi's escape mechanism:  ^V^M.  And of course
you can use almost any keys you like to invoke the macro, e.g., ^Xsp.

Karen, 
	I tried your suggestion and for a second thought it was working 
but what I got was the page then whatever I had done before, i.e. 
scrolling up thru log on or whatever else I had done. Thanks a million 
but I am still in deep do-do.

This problem seems to have fixed itself. I went inot the setup menu
and had a look but didn't do anything. When I got out and exited Pine,
the file was OK when I went back in, but the message I sent wasn't
there. Perhaps the file was temporaily corrupted? Any ideas?

Remember, ALWAYS do backups!

You really should take a look at the help system in pine and the
supplied documentation.

Pine doesn't directly support pgp.  You can use mkpgp which
integrate pgp with pine.

Yes, you can read/post messages to Usenet groups.  See the online
documentation (? at the main menu).

Perhaps my previous Subject confused matters.  If someone knows what might 
be causing my problem, I sure would appreciate a note.  

Also what address do I use to unsubscribe.  I'll be going on vacation 
sometime and might want to unsubscribe before I go.  ;)

Thanks for your help on either of these questions.

    Assuming you are running the current version of Pine, 3.91, from
the Main Menu go into Setup and Config.  Scroll down to customized-hdrs 
and add a line:  Reply-To: the_address_you_want_replies_to_go_to

Well, it's *supposed* to sort by date within the pseudo thread...
but it is a bit picky about having correct date headers.
For example if you see one that has the year in two-digit form (e.g. "96")
it will always sort before the messages with correct four-digit years...

If you have examples of messages that appear to have correctly formatted
date headers but don't sort correctly, please bounce a couple of examples
to me and I'll get them to the right person.

Subject: PC pine folders problem
Message-Id: <Pine.OSF.3.91.960312163332.15864A-100000@sable.ox.ac.uk>
Mime-Version: 1.0

I have unziped and put the Pine and Pico programs onto my hard disk 
drive.  The program loads OK, but it cant open any folders.  I believe 
UNIX systems have lots of default folders and mailboxes so all this 
tedious work is unnecessary.

I have tried both PC pine and Pine for Windows with the same problems.  
The PC is networked to a mail server through PC-NFS (a Sun thing I think).

In reality, it is probably just the fact that I dont know how to 
configure Pine on a PC.  The Pine I use on a UNIX platform was already 
configured for me and I cant find any support for Pine for PC.

Please help

Actually, in 3.91 it doesn't sort by date within the pseudo thread, it
sorts by arrival order.  So if messages arrive out of order, they will
show up out of order with this sort (or with the default Arrival sort).
In 3.92 we're changing it to sort by date within the pseudo thread.

Ok, great.  Is there a proposed release date for 3.92 yet?  I don't wanna 
nag, but if you've got the info (or a way for me to get it), I (and my 
whole staff) would appreciate it.

Thanks for the replies!

Scratch all that -- I got the PINE.EXE to load and I got the ever-familiar
menu, but whenever I try sending a message, I get the following error:

Bug in Pine detected: "Received abort signal"
Exiting pine.

And then it dumps me back to the DCL prompt.  This happens when I type ^X to
send...

For the record, it's not v3.91 as I had first thought, but rather it's version 
3.89.1.2-VMS-7 (according to the top line of the main menu).

To whom it may concern. 


My name is Ysabel. I'm a student from Essex County College in New Jersey. 
I would like to know more about internet. My main concern right now is
how to use internet prooperly and to take advantage of it as much as I
can.  Another concern is that I would like to know how to get in contact
with the Catholic University of Chile to exchange information about their
Student Government. 

Waiting for your response.

Sincerely,
Ysabel.

Is their any way for Pine to automatically delete messages from a certain

and I just wanted to have Pine delete 'em. I know that a prog. called 
BeyondMail can do it..Thanks for any replies...

Greetings -

Please pardon me if this is not the correct place to post this request.

I'm looking for documentation on MAPI and SMTP under Win95. The object is to 
update some old Win3x C code. A spec would help, but an SDK at reasonable cost 
would be ideal.

Thanks in advance for any help you can give me!

Yes, I spent a fair amount of time porting ispell to Pyramid's DC/OSx, and
found out the hard way that there is no easy way (that is obvious to me) to 
integrate ispell with pine's editor, pico.  The only way I can see is by
someone hacking up spell.c in pico's source to write out to a temp file as
it normally does, then pass that file as an argument to ispell, and then
re-read the file after ispell exits.

Unfortunately this is just beyond the scope of my skills just just now, but
I can recognize what exactly needs to change, and where to change it.  If
somebody out there has already been this route, I'd appreciate whatever help
they would be willing to lend, and/or their diff against spell.c ;-)

Thanks in advance,

What sort of files do I find in the location below? They look like 
binaries, or are they somehow compressed? How do I decompress them? Are 
these really the sources that I am looking for? I need PICO on an 
Olivetti Unix machine.

I am having trouble with messages multiplying  themselves in my inbox.
I am suspecting that the path I am specifing in popclient /home/kelly/
/mail/mail-in is somehow duplicating a path to INBOX. Messages are 
showing up in both INBOX and mail-in. Does anyone have any experience 
with this sort of problem. Thanks.

I was composing a message and when I finished I discovered that my 2-300

of another user's messages). How do I unmerge this big message into 
seperate ones again?

Subject: question

I have a question.  A friend of mine in Missouri told me that we can
communicate by the computer.  Not e-mailing each other but having our
computers talking to one another.  Do you have any suggestions that I may
try to get this to work?  I have tried through my e-mail but it doesn't let
me.  I can send her regular e-mail thats no problem.  This is the way she
tries to reach me on my computer at New Mexico State.  This is what she wrote:


As far as talking on the computers you have to get into the internet program
and do it from there.  New Mexico State has PINE so try that and see if you
can make a connection.  The computer will let you know if it can get
through, I know that I can because I tried but you were not logged on to the
system and thats why I could not talk to  you, its like trying to send
e-mail except that you have to type "talk user id."  and then wait till I
answer.  Inorder for this to work both parties have to be logged on to the
system.



I hope that you can help me.  I was just wondering if there is a way to do
this. I would really appreciate your input.

Thanks,

What she's talking about is a Unix daemon.  Not at all related to Pine 
electronic mail, and cannot be used from within Pine.
Talk is a Unix daemon that allows a two-way conversation between two Unix 
accounts.
Both people must be logged in to their accounts at the same time (you can 
use finger, another Unix daemon, to determine if the other person is 
logged in or not) for Talk to work.
Different releases of Talk don't communicate well with each other, and 
sometimes if the two machines have the talk daemon loaded on different 
ports, it won't work either.  You'll have to find out by trial and error.

To find out if your friend is logged in to her account, type the 
following at the Unix (system) prompt in your account:

finger login

where login is the name of her account.  ie, if you wanted to finger my 
account you would type

finger maldridg

To initiate a talk session with your friend, type the following at the 
Unix (system) prompt in your account:

talk login@machine.name.here

where the login@machine.name.here string is her e-mail address.  If you 
wanted to talk to someone on the same machine as you, you would only have 
to type 

talk login

So, to talk to my account, for example, you'd type

talk maldridg@gpu.srv.ualberta.ca

Hope this information helps you out some...

Read my original posting. The intent is to base the spamfile contents upon 
identifying the spam's source address and/or the subject line. If you've 
used dmail, you'll recognize that I'm not suggesting anything new, just 
something more convenient for the average user. The system administrator 
doesn't read your email. The system administrator gets spammed. Since the 
sysadmin is likely to be reading their mail (and hence the spam) before the 
average user logs on and gets the same spam, the system administrator 
uses a function similar to `Take Address' (currently in Pine), which 
appends the From: address and/or the Subject: line to the spamfile. The 
spamfile is written to only by the sysadmin. It gets read by Pine each 
time a user launches Pine, *IF* the user has their Pine-config file 
spam setting set to "spam off".



: Btw, you forgot to add your "CDA supporter signature".  HTH.
: (I just hope this isn't the PGP Zimmermann .. ;-)

I added it; I just used non-printing characters. That way, those who are 
supposed to read it know it's there.

As for PGP Zimmermann...
Well, you figure it out.

read-only.  How can I make other messages that I receive read-only?

Hello

I am having trouble with using swedish characters (=E5=E4=F6) in the header
when using pine, even if it works in the message text. I wonder if there
is a way to get this to work?

To make life easier for people wishing to download source code it is 
standard practice to bundle up the files into just one: an "archive".  
On UNIX systems the "tar" program is most commonly used to do this, hence 
giving rise to the name "a tar archive" to describe the resulting 
archive.  Such archives are usually given a filename ending ".tar" to 
indicate that it contains a tar'd archive.

As these files can be quite large it is also common practice to 
subsequently compress them.  Sometimes the UNIX "compress" program is 
used; this gives a resulting file with a name anding ".Z".  A rival 
compression program (which often achieves better compression) is GNU zip, 
or "gzip".  Files compressed with gzip have names ending ".gz".

If you use anonymous ftp to connect to:

	ftp.cac.washington.edu

and then go down into the "pine" subdirectory you will see a file called

	pine3.91.tar.Z

The is a file containing the compressed (".Z") tar archive (".tar") of 
the source code to Pine 3.91 ("pine3.91").  In fact the "README" file in 
this directory also mentions this fact. :-)

You will need to transfer this file in *binary* mode (compressed data 
needs to be transferred in binary mode).

Having got the file unto your system you will need to uncompress it, then 
un-tar it:

	uncompress pine3.91.tar.Z
	tar xvf pine3.91.tar

This will recreate the directory tree containing the Pine distribution.

You will only find binary (executable) versions of Pine if you go down a 
further level into the "unix-bin" directory, for example.

If its on a Unix system, you can move them to the mail directory and then 
read them....

mv <filename> mail/

I don't know if this is the best advice, but what the hey:

    0.  QUIT PINE!!!
    1.  chmod 600 /usr/mail/<your username>
    2.  vi /usr/mail/<your username>
    3.  :w ~/somefile <return?
    4.  1G <return>
    5.  dG
    6.  :wq <return>
    7.  chmod 660 /usr/mail/<your username>
    8.  try pine again

This saves the contents of your know mangled INBOX to ~/somefile, so
that you can try to recover a few messages from somefile, then removes
all entries from INBOX.  Be sure to quit pine first.

This may also prevent mail from being delivered while you are attempting
to toast the box's content (by taking away the system's permissions to
write into the file).  Note that this will only work on some systems (on
others, the mail delivery process runs as root, and root can always
write to your files...).  In that case, steps 1 and 7 are useless.

If /usr/mail is writable by you, consider the following instead

    0. QUIT PINE!!!
    1. mv /usr/mail/<your username> ~/somefile
    2. touch /usr/mail/<your username>
    3. try pine again

Chances are that you do not have write permission to this directory.

	On my other UNIX accounts, I have ran across this problem.  Here 
are the solutions that I did.

First I did the following to my .plan

chmod 644 .plan

On my directory it looks like the following (does it match yours?)

  1 -rw-r--r--  1 rbaqai   ea            387 Feb 17 02:16 .plan

Next, there is this weird thing with some fingers it seems.  Forcing a 
long output seems to take care of it.

So, to finger me you can try the following things.

finger rbaqai@ea.oac.uci.edu    (gives you really short response, no plan)

To get my plan, you would have to do the following

finger -l rbaqai@ea.oac.uci.edu	(yes, the plan file now appears!)

Note, that is a dash L .. and I think case matters, although I would 
guess it depends from which OS system you were running.

Hope that solves any problems you have.

This means, that your option-settings in pine.conf conflicts with 
settings in  pine.conf.fixed. The options in pine.conf.fixed 
(normally sets from an administrator) overrules the options in pine.conf 
(the user configuration-file).
Deleting the .pinerc file couldn't help.

Subject: Using MH folders - how?
Date: 12 Mar 1996 14:06:31 GMT
Message-Id: <4i40d7$2ms@kuikka.inet.fi>

How can I persuade Pine (running on LINUX) to treat ~/Mail as 
an MH style folder collection.  I've tried every imaginable
permution using #mh/ in my .pinerc "folder-collections=" line
with no success.

I am a long time MH user who would like to try out Pine if it
only could access my existing MH folder tree ...

TIA,

Timo

First things first:

	Do not normally run your Linux logged in as 'root'.

If you don't understand why, or don't care, I suggest you install DOS or
whatever.

Then, use 'adduser' to create an account 'maddo005'. Use that.

What's the point? If you want to read news offline, you have to set up a
newsserver for that. There are various alternatives.

Hi!

I would like to know if it is possible to change the bugs-adress, 
bugs-fullname...
from the default "Pine Developers <pine-bugs@cac.washington.edu>
into the address of my local system-administrator.

I tried to do this before by adding it into the pine.conf but it doesn't
work .

What can I do else/instead or isn't it possible????

Please answer
 Tanja

I've installed pine3.91 under solaris 2.4 with minimum trouble. The only 
problem was thast I have not the Sun C compiler (pretty costly stuff) and 
I had to use gcc, while the Makefiles are set up for "cc". My solution 
was to dig into individual makefiles and find where the CC macro was 
defined (usually you'll find a commented definition for gcc and you've 
just to uncomment it). Unfortunately I didn't keep the modified makefile 
(but that's because I judged that the modification was very little and 
could be done again very quickly).

On Unix systems, it's normally in your home directory.  Look for
.addressbook and .addressbook.lu there.  To verify the location, from 
the Pine main menu, select Setup/Config.  There should be an entry for
address-book.

Since it works for other people, it would be interesting to know what
is the cause of your problem.  Since you refer to "Pine 3.9.1" rather
than to Yehavi's port or the Innosoft product, it's hard to understand
what precisely you are talking about.

There are a variety of options available in the configuration menu under

Use the one you find convenient.

---------------------------
| Sorting the Address book |
---------------------------
 
By default, address book entries are sorted alphabetically on the full
name with distribution lists sorted to the end.  Sorting can be changed by
resetting the address book sort rule in the Pine SETUP CONFIGURATION screen
--assuming you have "write" permission for the address book file.
 
Unlike the sorting of folders (which only changes presentation), sorting an
address book actually changes the file as it is kept on the computer.  For
this reason you may not be able to sort a shared or system-wide address
book.

Sure. Just use the compose command and fill in the name of the 
newsgroup(s) you want to post to in the header Newsgrps: (You might have 
to invoke Rich Headers (^R) to do this.)

I wrote up the following C++ program real quick to parse /etc/passwd. It 
creates an addressbook entry for Pine so that you can mass mail all the 
users on a system!

There are only a couple minor bugs with it, if anyone cares to improve it 
by adding more features or making it more efficient please do so and 
E-Mail an update to me or post it to the mailing list.

  also, no reason to abuse pine for this when many systems have a cute

Well, I run linux on my box at home, and the startup time for pine
was beginning to annoy me.  elm starts faster, and the executable
is less than 40% of the size of pine (naturally, elm doesn't include
an editor).  Choosing vi as my default editor, (actually elvis), the
executable is still less than 50% as large and *much* faster. I'm
actually tempted to switch my editor to pico to ease my
transition.

I'll admit that pine is easier to use for the new user, but elm 
seems to have all the features that I used in pine, and I'm not 
really a new user anymore.

So the only feature that convinced me to switch was speed. Both
utilities are easy to use, have aliasing, and allow attachments 
as well as folder handling.

Now that I'm aware of filtering, this may be a feature I use that 
is not an option (that I'm aware of) that pine has.

Date: Wed, 13 Mar 1996 10:33:45 GMT
Message-Id: <4i6516$otu@gn2.gn.apc.org>

I am trying to use Pine 3.91 on SCO Unix with MMDF as the mail
transport.

The rouble is, whenever Pine tries to send mail, i get a "no valid
author" message.

Turns out that this is from MMDF's "submit" command that queues mail.

I can get the sam problem if i call /usr/lib/sendmail _without_ the -f
sender flag. Pine doesn't add the -f flag when it invokes sendmail,
because it assumes that this is a regular sendmail which can find the
sender from the From: header.

It seems that this sendmail is part of MMDF, not a regular sendmail.

I could get round this if either i could get submit or
/usr/lib/sendmail to emulate the -f flaG, or, if i could get Pine to
add the -f flag.

Doesn anyone out therE have expirience with this?

Help!

I am a relatively new user of the internet and am having problems 
exporting plain text files from Pine. I am working in a netserv 
environment, from a LAN computer at my office, and according to the 
program which I use to dial the fileserver the home directory is c:\aw. 
But when I tell the machine to export the plain text file and I think it 
should go to that directory it doesn't, and in fact searches everywhere I 
can think of fail to locate the file.

Can anyone suggest where the file is going, or how I could ensure I know 
where it is going?

Help would be greatly appreciated!

I am using the Usenet program tin on my unix mailgate system. When I post 
a message in a group and I want to look the next day if there are any 
reactions (follow-up's) yet, I have to remember the subject text in order 
to search the thread. That is a nuissance, I think. Isn't there a way to 
automatically keep track of certain threads and be warned if a follow-up 
has been posted on one of your contributions? I know this can be done in 
some Windows newsreaders but can it be done with tin also?

How do you suppress the appearance of the aliases of adresses when 
sending mail to a large group of people.

Subject: ^L on a NeXT

I'm running Pine 3.88 under NeXTSTEP 3.0 on a NeXTstation.

The only problem I've encountered is in fetching new mail before Pine does it's  
regular update every 2.5 minutes.  The documentation says that this can be done  
by either 

(a) going to the bottom of the index and hitting N five times (this works) or
(b) using CONTROL-L.

Well, ^L DOES refresh the screen, as expected, but it doesn't update the index.

Has anyone had any experience with this before?  

Can you help me get ^L to work as advertised?

By the way, here are my stty settings...

fermat> stty everything
new tty, speed 9600 baud, 24 rows, 80 columns

Easiest way is probably to search by author, with your name (michielp) as 
the author.  In TIN type 'a' to search by author.  If you don't remember 
what group(s) you posted to, type W (shift + w) to get a list of your 
posts.  Hope this helps.  BYE.

When you export a file, it becomes a plain text file in the home 
directory wherever the pine program is, not your local hard drive.  You 
must then use a modem transfer program to move it from the server to your 
local machine.

An example.  I export a messsage, naming it test.txt

I leave pine and from my unix shell prompt type:  sz test.txt

This calls up the zmodem program on both commputers to transfer the file 
to my local hard drive.  Most everyone uses zmodem these days, although 
you may find that you need to use xmodem, kermit, or something else 
depending on what your providers offers.

So when the sys admin sees a spam from aol, delphi, netcom or whatever
then he will ban *all* emails from that site, right?
Of course you never get any emails from them, so why bother?

First step would be to make everyone use the same mail program.
But I am sure Bill gates will take care of that.

Next step is to force everybody to send their mail to whitehouse.gov.
Then the president himself can select what's good for you to read!
After all he signed the damn CDa thing, right?

Tell you what - send *all* mail to /dev/null!  Bingo - no more mail problems!

In Italy, of course, they have the Mafia to do the killing...

Date: 14 Mar 1996 16:24:22 GMT
Message-Id: <4i9h7m$hqv@nuke.csu.net>

I am researching the possibility of using Pine as a login shell for system
users.  Naturally, I am concerned with a few features of Pine.

Does anyone have an example of a pine.conf.fixed file from a UNIX
system?  In particular, I want to be sure that users cannot suspend
the process, shell-out or modify their environment.  As well, users
should not be able to modify many of the configuration items...

Any experiences would be helpful...

Thanks for your time!
Eric

So only the sys admin gets to edit the spam file?  And he has to read the mail
and update the spam file before other copies hit the users' mailboxes?
Don't you know that this means *immediate* action?

You are imposing the task of constant email scanning upon the sys admin.
Don't you think he has enough email to read and things to take care of?

Btw, you still didn't give a solution to possible errors in the spamfile.
What if a rule kills mails with *vital* info for a user?

Don't you think that a person can take care of his own mailbox?

So dmail has it.  So WHAT?  "Proof by example"?

We use a restricted version of pine this way, though I recompiled it to 
use a different file for the fixed config, as we have both clients and 
staff using pine on the same machine. (Silly, I know, but "economical")

Disable suspend, Pipe-to-command, and alternate editors, and you should be
OK, I think. I also set it such that they cannot alter their configs at
all, though that may be too draconian. ;-)

You can use ispell within the editor by going to (S)etup (C)config from 
the main menu and selecting 'enable_alternate_editor_cmd'. If you never 
want to use any other commands you can then set 'editor' to 'ispell'. Now 
the command ^_ when composing will run ispell. If you want to run other 
commands on your composition eg vi then leave 'editor' blank and the 
command ^_ will prompt you with the value of VISUAL (or EDITOR I'm not 
exactly sure which of the top of my head) and you can overwrite this 
with 'ispell'.

I have a work around:

Go into the message body and enter the subject line.
Cut it with ^K and paste it into the subject line with ^U

You don't get =E5=E4=F6 in the subject line. You get the 8-bit characters.
So the receiver can't read it if he has a different character set.

Message-Id: <4i9rr9$46j@fcnews.fc.hp.com>

I've just edited my .pinerc file to format printing with the Y command.

printer=x2 | lp -onb

I would like to enhance this with name and date variables based on the subject
or source and the value shown for "Date".  Something like

printer=x2 -t "$DATE $SUBJECT"  | lp -onb

This is to put helpful information in the header (rather than "piped").
Do variables such as $DATE or $SUBJECT exist in PINE at runtime?

-DAvid

P.S. Anybody know of an undocumented way to fill the Date field in x2 (on
     HP-UX 9.07)?

   There is nothing one can do against the first spam.

   That would be enough !

   Well, the job is best done once for everybody !

   As user, and as surrogate system scapegoat (here "unicuique system
   manager fortunae suae"), I'd like to prevent spams to enter my
   system. The most efficient way would be to detect them at sendmail
   level and send to /dev/null, not to store them into each user's
   mailbox, and having the user agent (Pine) discarding them.
   What if an user does not use Pine (here e.g. there is a group of
   people which use SUn's mailtool) ?

   Can this "spam ban" be implemented at sendmail level ?

pico?  ugh.   Sure, it 's simple to use, but too simple to be of much use.

If you already use vi - why not try vim?
It has a help command (:help), it allows you to split the window (:split) it
lets you undo everything unto the first change (and redo if you have gone to
far back), you can select text by highlighting it and it can reformat text for
you (just press 'Q' after selecting the text).  And it has lots more!  :-)

Read about vim on page

Well, filters are independent of the mailers you use.
You can actually use ELM's filter and yet use Pine.

Although not as simple I can recommend "procmail" as a filter
which lets you do all the stuff that is too complicated for "filter".

Anyone have any ideas about sudden crashes of Pine 3.91 on SunOS 4.1.4 
with the error message:

Bug in Pine detected: "Bogus entry in new cache list".
Exiting pine.

These crashes occur sometimes when Pine is running, but I'm not 
interacting with it at all.  It'll be running, I'll go away for awhile 
and when I come back, it's dead.

Any ideas would be appreciated.

You want popclient (a unix program) to download your mail and add it to 
your spool. Then you can use pine to read your mail from that popserver. 
You can make it a cron job, and have popclient check your mail every so 
often. Check with the admin of your unix machine about the availability 
of popclient.

    Okay, so my newsreader doesn't recognize MIME.  But that's better in
my opinion than reading the news locally which is delayed by five days...

    Anyway, to answer your question, yes, Pine3.92 will work properly
(or maybe even perfectly ;-) for non-ASCII headers.  Hold your breath,
because it will be coming pretty soon -- can't say for sure when, but
trust me, it will be soon, if not soon enough...

 While viewing a list of newsgroups in Pine I hit enter to go to a 
listing of postings or messages (the index). Then the right arrow to read 
the desired posting. I can handle that. However while in the index how do 
I get back to the newsgroups listing? If this was a html document I would 
just hit the left arrow, but Pine refuses to understand that key at that 
particular time. These little things confuse me.

You are talking about the "mbox" or "Bezerkeley" file format. The
"mtext" or "tenex" file format encodes the length of a message, into
the flags on the first line.

Escaping embedded "From" lines is the responsibility of the local
delivery agent (/bin/mail, procmail, etc.) which is appending the
incoming message to a mail spool file. Sendmail hands the LDA a chunk
of ascii bytes as one message, and the LDA escapes all non-initial
"From" lines. If it won't do that, then either you are giving it the
wrong flags, or else it is broken :-) (are we starting an argument
yet, is Solaris /usr/lib/mail.local broken? :-)

What if your imapd (or popper, whatever) adds a new header to store
some status flags, after you've read a message; do you expect it to
compute a new Content-Length and edit the old Content-Length header?
(similarly how MH will delete the "Unix From" line and replace it with
a "Return-Path" line, also altering the content length)

If the mailbox is in mtext format, the new status flags go into the
same header line as the content length, which IS recomputed and
updated properly by the imapd.

But if the mailbox is in mbox Berzerkeley format, the only thing
guaranteed is that there will be a leading Unix From line.

Nay, my humble opinion is that Content-Length headers, in mbox format
files, are a curious abomination which should be stomped out :-)

For the wish list:   Pine 3.92 (or 93... :) could react to its user's
opening an incoming email containing, as a header,

X-Confirm-Reading-To: user@somewhere

by dispatching a receipt that quotes the header date, time and
subject, and timestamps the reader's access to the message.

That would be compatible with the mechanism used by Pegasus (which is
probably as widespread in the MSDOS/Windows world as Pine is in the Unix
world), and would therefore be useful to quite a wide audience.

Use 'i' for index, 'l' for list of folders (i.e. newsgroups listings)

This same thing happened to me when loading the Slackware 3.0
version of Linux 1.2.13

The error message "can't load library libgdbm.so.2" , is coming
from the sendmail program. Probably because somebody left some debug
code on by mistake.

To rectify the problem, install the libc package from the d set
(Program Development) from the Slackware distribution.

This will install the libgdbm.so.2 and the message will go away.


Another alternative is to use something other than the sendmail
program such as smail.

Help! The screen of my pine suddenly turned black with white print.  
Actually, this is quite nice, but it infuriates me that _I_ had nothing 
to do with it, and I would like to be a fully autonomous 
switcher-back-and-forth!  The answer to this question is probably very 
obvious (and may even arise from inside my ZTerm communications program) 
but I have been unable to solve it. Outside pine, the video display is 
normal.  What to do?

Well, I tried it, but these Freenet guys are awfully good.  I got a "Read 
permission denied .newsrc" message when I tried to read in the file.  
Even if I had been able to do it, I wouldn't have been able to save it.  
Our Pico is tied in with the Lynx directory editing function, so that 
Pico can only be started after giving a filename to Lynx.  If I wanted to 
create a new file and give it a name starting with a dot, Lynx would say 
"Illegal filename request ignored".  If I wanted to edit a file, I have 
to choose that file from a menu in Lynx, and those menus don't show dot 
files.

Thanks for the advice, anyway.

Greg,
There is now an IETF working group looking at the "read receipt" issue,
and when the dust settles, we'll take a close look at it --but anything we
do will require user concurrence before a receipt would be sent.

Yes and no...

It's true that the Pine distribution includes a pop3 driver that can be
optionally enabled, HOWEVER:

 o Inclusion of this driver is for experimentation and its use should not
   be considered a supported configuration, for the following reasons...

 o Pine does not yet have "offline" support, so the POP driver attempts
   to do a weak imitation of full IMAP online interaction with the mail
   server, as opposed to the "download and delete" offline paradigm
   that most people expect and want when they use POP.  (Offline support
   is planned for later this year.)

 o As distributed, Pine 3.91's pop driver has some bugs. I think these
   are corrected in the 3.92 code, with one exception:

 o If you try to Expunge messages via POP, Pine will not recognize that
   they have been expunged in terms of the Index display, leading to
   some surprising results.  This won't get fixed until Pine 4.x which
   will be based on later (IMAP4-compliant) c-client libraries.

So using "popclient" as a front-end to Pine may well be the preferred
solution.

Due to high-traffic mailing lists, hundreds of messages pile up in my 
INBOX.  If I exit pine, it can take a *long* time to return to the UNIX 
prompt...

The second problem:  a friend of mine said that a message didn't appear 
in the list of messages in the INBOX...but *was* visible by reading the 
.mailrc file.  At the end of the message that preceded it in the INBOX 
were several strangely-behaving blank lines...

A problems I've had is forwarding a message to a mailing list...if I trim 
the wrong headers, sometimes the forwarded message will re-appear as 
though it came to me from the original sender!

I like this present feature, since it is much faster than downloading 
potentially hundereds of files, and I think it should remain as an option 
with future releases.

A digression, an editable From: field would be nice, as apposed to just 
the Reply-To: one. In addition, being able to type in any ISO-8859-x
character set would be a wonderful feature, including bi-directionality 
of text for the appropriate character sets, i.e. Arabic, Hebrew ....

    If Pine itself imposes an upper limit on the number of addressees
in the "To:" field, I am not aware of it.  However, some mail
_transfer_ agents, which actually send the mail out, such as some
configurations of sendmail under Unix, may impose a limit.  Check with
your system administrator.

I was wondering how I could configure Pine to automagically send me a copy

not find out how.

Thanks!

Sounds like you have 2 copies of pine running.  After you ^Z suspended 
pine and went to a talk session, you must bring the suspended progaram 
back to the forground (with the unix 'fg' command), then (q)uit pine 
properly before logging out.  Only a thought.  Hope this helps.  BYE.

Hiya,

I am useing MachTen 4.0.2 and would like to put PINE/PICO on it.  I have
tried getting the .tar.g source and compiling it.  No good, I get errros

source.  I did set my trtansfer type to I and got them (renaming
pine-bin.machten to pine. etc) but it says invalid achtecture when I try
to run them.  What am I doing wrong?


Any help would be GREATLY appreciated.

Hi everyone!

Could anyone please tell me how I can switch to "Repy-To" in the header, 
so that the replies will be sent to the "reply-to"-address instead of the 
"from"-address?

TIA,
Sven Buschke.

I have Perl scripts which will convert Eudora addresses (nicknames) to 
Pine addresses and vice versa.  Go to my home page (see below) and scroll 
to the bottom.

If a script does not work, I will send it to you you directly.  Some 
people have problems getting the scripts directly of my Web page.

As far as many are concerned - myself included - this is a definite
waste of bandwidth, and an invasion of privacy.  If I want someone 
to know I've read their message, I'll respond to them.  Otherwise,
don't make that decision for me.

If not, is there a hard way? :)

My .pinerc has something like this:

It works except that I can't get pine to read ~/Mail/inbox (MH's "inbox")

: It works except that I can't get pine to read ~/Mail/inbox (MH's "inbox")

Unless PINE's got a new feature I don't know about, it can't read the MH style
messages (which are stored in separate files) - you can however convert MH
"folders" into mail style files which can be read by pine/elm/mailx etc..  The
easiest way is to use packmbox.sh which comes in the MH 6.8 ditribution.

If you end up hating PINE you can always go back to MH by re inc'ing the PINE
files back into MH "folders".

    The upcoming release 3.92, which really and truly will be available
Really Soon Now[tm], does have support for the X mouse, enabling you to
do such things as move around in composition text, select and paste,
and click on commands to execute them, as well as providing new mail
notification in the icon.  Mouse support can also work for Pico.

    Yeah, I can tell the difference.  Msen accepts incoming mail.

I am new to Pine and have a very dumb question.

Is it possible to compose an e-mail off-line 
(before I get into Pine) and then copy it into
Pine when I want to send it.  This would greatly
reduce the amount of time that I tie up the phone
line.

I am using an old 286 with DOS.

Thanks,

Brad Marks

PS.  Please respond with e-mail.

Thank you for the info, Terry.

What would seem most reasonable, to me anyway, is for honouring such
requests to be a configurable item.  The system default would be set at
installation, and perhaps users could change it in .pinerc if there were
reason to do so.  I think Pine still asks too many questions that either
oughtn't to be choices (like "use reply-to address?"), or ought to be
configuration items.  A matter of taste, admittedly. 

In Pegasus, as you may know, the network installation allows the sysadmin
not only to set the default but to choose whether or not to allow users to
override the setting.  Our installation forces read-receipt-requests to be
honoured, although an exception would be allowed if anyone were really
upset by the loss of privacy thus inflicted.  So far the request has never
been made.  Personally I think this is better than giving the option and
then telling the users it's a matter of company policy that they shouldn't
use it.  That tends to invite mountain-out-of-molehill-making, IMHO. 

After all, if you pick up your phone, the person on the other end knows 
you've received their call... but I digress... :)

    This must be selected at time of compilation, for reasons that it
could otherwise be too easy for users to fake mail.  Not that this will
keep them from firing up Netscape...

    This is more a function of what your keyboard driver and display can
do for you.  It's not possible to mix character sets, but if I had things
configured properly on this end, I would be able to switch this PC
keyboard to a Czech one and type a message in Czech (ISO-8859-2) with no
difficulty whatsoever (except for lack of knowledge of the language ;-).

    Alternatively, an alternate editor which is aware of the
bi-directionality could be used instead of pico when typing in ISO-8859-6
or -8.  As far as I know, pico doesn't work so well with bidi text, though
it will give you no problems when you are properly configured for any of
the other ISO 8859 subsets.

	Your wish will soon be granted!

	The soon to be released pine3.92 will have an Lcc: header where
you can specify the list name.  The receipients will only see the name
of the list.

Is this the feature you are looking for?

        FEATURE: reply-always-uses-reply-to

This feature controls an aspect of Pine's Reply command.  If set, Pine
will not prompt when a message being replied to contains a "Reply-To:"
header value, but will simply use its value (as opposed to using the
"From:" field's value).

Note, this is usually the preferred behavior, however there is a certain,
popular list manager that places the list's address in the "Reply-To:"
field.  This feature makes it all too easy for personal replies to be
inadvertently sent to the entire mail list.

    No, because you can add *any* header you want, in addition to the ones
one commonly sees, like To: and Reply-To: and Organization: and
X-Indecency: and so on.

    But if you do ^Rich headers, you'll see the ones Pine does by default,
which I see as...

    I've added the Reply-To: to direct the mail to me, instead of to
whoever I happen to be logged in as when I access a folder, but you can
add any headers you want your mail to contain to the custom-headers, and
any you want to see all the time to the default-headers -- such as if you
wanted to change your X-Indecency: header for each message you post.

I thought I would add my feature request.

Where I previously worked, we had the capability to do an on-the-spot 
query against a whois file to determine userids.  We had about 6000+ 
users so sometimes it was impossible to keep your addressbook up to date.

It would be nice to have that kind of query ability to build a list of 
userids.

Just a thought.

     How?  All the documentation that I have seen implies that PINE 
itself cannot retrieve e-mail via POP.  It will do IMAP with no problems 
but POP support is not built in.

Greetings:
I appreciate all the help I got regarding "talk" and I think while trying 
to experiment with this, I messed something up and now when I open my 
Sent Mail, I get a message that it is locked from another process (?) and 
is Read Only.  I think what happened is that perhaps I was out of Pine 
long enough that it shut down (?) Any ideas? Any solutions? Thanks for 
any help you can offer.

Date: 15 Mar 1996 21:45:07 GMT
Message-Id: <RICH.96Mar15164507@steam.sunknox.east.sun.com>

O.k.  I just read the FAQ entry on file formats and it is pretty clear
that it uses 'From blah blah blah' to separate mail messages (where
'blah blah blah' is a real From line).

The problem is that some MUAs and LDAs don't escape embedded From
lines (such as during forwarding messages) and expect the
'Content-length' field of the header to be accurate (which is always
true here, since /usr/lib/mail.local is doing the counting).

The consequence is that Pine and/or the imapd process return multiple
messages when there aren't multiple messages.  Is there a way to tell
Pine/imap to trust/use the Content-length field?

If not, can someone give me pointers as to where I should make
modifications to fix this?

Thanks.

X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.4 PL24]
Content-Type: text
Content-Length: 847       

Actually, two new feature requests, both for PC-Pine:

  1) I don't like things that beep at me when I make an erroneous
keystroke.  I especially don't like things that go "deedle, deedle,
deedle!" at me.  So, I would suggest an option that turns off beeping
completely (or at least makes it a very short, polite "blip", maybe even 
a "bip" ;)

  2) Seems like I have to run through a long gamut of questions every 
time I start PC-Pine and want to compose a message.  Seems to me the only 
thing it should have to ask for is my username and password when I first 
start it up.  I know that I can set "user-id" and "personal-name" in the 
pinerc file, but this is not a solution for a lab setting.  Is it 
possible to have PC-Pine finger (or equivalent) the IMAP server (or host 
of my choice) to acquire the user's full name?

  Thanks so much!

	I know the new Unix pine will have:

        FEATURE: quell-status-message-beeping

This feature affects Pine's behavior when it displays status message
(e.g., Error complaints, New mail warnings, etc).  Setting this feature
will not affect the display of such messages, but will cause those that
emit a beep to become silent.

	Maybe PC Pine will as well.....

Pine is a mail & Usenet News program, not an IRC client program.  You 
cannot use IRC with Pine, but need to use other software.  Ask your local 
help desk for assistance as they will/should know what software is 
installed on your computers.

Cheers,

Mike Brudenell                                         <pmb1@york.ac.uk>

I include below a message coming from a Macintosh which has a 
Content-Type text/plain and a peculiar 'name' attribute, i.e. "Message 
Body". Since pine believes, because of 'name', that the message is a 
file, reading this message requires two carriage returns and going back 
requires Exiting twice.

The pine behaviour is very irritating for users, and it looks like there 
is no way to set the Mac mailer not to use this attribute. Furthermore, I 
could not find anything in the RFC that precludes the use of the 'name' 
attribute for something different from a file name.
To make users happy I had to patch mailview.c and not set the has_name 
variable when the 'name' value is "Message Body".

Any comments?

Hello,
I have made some testing with pine, Netscape and Eudora on my side. It looks like pine is the only client that can not handle messages coming from QM correctly. Both Netscape and Eudora works fine (they do NOT consider the mail body to be an enclosure). So maybe the problem is pine?

I am using PINE 3.91 (UNIX) from my MAC with ZTerm 1.0b3. I am unable to 
save non-text (e.g., images) to my hard drive. How do I do this with 
"message body" or "attachments"?

When I tried to download Email GIF, PINE gave me the following message:
"[Part 1, Image/GIF  11KB]
  [Can not display this part. Use the "V" command to save in a file]"

Then I pressed "V" and got:
 " 1   11 KB      Image
  [Message 1 has only one part (the message body), and no attachments.]"

Pressing "S" gives me:
"Copy attachment to file in current directory:"

What configurations/commands are needed for Pine, UNIX and/or ZTerm?

     just double-click on the file icon and it automatically expands
     (unstuffs). This is for more advanced mac computer users only, as
     you still have to know how to deal with an attached file.  It will cut
     your download time by 75%.   Expands out to the same ~525K file in

     able to do.
4.  For expert computer users: compressed attached text file, created with

     has expansion software to decompress (expand) Stuffit(tm) (.sit) files.
     This is for more advanced computer users only and will cut your

     #2.  See option #2 for more info on what you will need to be able to do.



Hi fellow 'netters,

My name is Shyamala Raperjee and I recently started using a magazine
subscription club in the USA that has a FREE 1 yr. magazine subscription
deal with your first paid order- and I have been very pleased with them.
They have over 1,500 different USA titles that they can ship to any country
on a subscription basis.   As for computer magazines from the USA, they
more of a selection than I ever knew even existed.  They have magazines for
most every area of interest in their list of 1,500 titles.

Within the USA, for their USA members, they are cheaper than all their
competitors and even the publishers themselves.  This is their price
guarantee.

Overseas, on the average, they are generally around one-fourth to one-half
of what the newsstands overseas charge locally for USA magazines.  On some
titles they are as little as one-tenth of what the newsstands charge.  They
feel that mgazines should not be a luxury overseas.   In the USA, people
buy magazines and then toss them after reading them for just a few minutes
or hours.  They are so cheap in the USA!   Well, this company would like to
make it the same way for their overseas members.  They are also cheaper
than all their competitors in the USA and overseas, including the
publishers themselves!   This is their price guarantee.  Around one-half
their business comes from overseas, so they are very patient with new
members who only speak limited English as a 2nd language.

Their prices are so cheap because they deal direct with each publisher and
cut-out all the middlemen.

They will send you their DELUXE EMAIL CATALOGUE (around 525K-big and
juicey) !)...if you completely fill out the form above.  It has lists of
all the freebies, lists of all the titles they sell, titles broken down by
categories and detailed descriptions on nearly 1,200 of the titles that
they sell.

Please do not email me as I am just a happy customer and a *busy* student.
I don't have time to even complete my thesis in time, let alone run my
part-time software business!  Please fill out the above form and carefully
follow the intructions above to get it to them via fax or smail.

They guarantee to beat all their competitors' prices. Sometimes they are
less than half of the next best deal I have been able to find and other
times, just a little cheaper - but I have never found a lower rate yet.
They assured me that if I ever do, they will beat it.

They have been very helpful and helped me with all my address changes as I
haved moved from one country to another.

They have a deal where you can get a free 1 yr. sub to a new magazine from
a special list of over 295 popular titles published in the USA.   They will
give you this free 1 yr. sub when you place your first paid order with them
to a renewal or new subscription to any of the over 1,500 different popular
USA titles they sell.

They can arrange delivery to virtually any country and I think they have
clients in around 45 or 46 countries now.  Outside the USA there is a
charge for FPH (foreign postage and handling) (on both paid and freebie
subs) that varies from magazine to magazine.  I have found their staff to
be very friendly and courteous.  They even helped me with an address change
when I moved from one country to another.

The owner thinks of his service as a "club" and his clients as "members"
(even though there is no extra fee to become a member - your first purchase
automatically makes you a member) and he is real picky about who he accepts
as a new member.   When he sets you up as a new member, he himself calls
you personally on the phone to explain how he works his deal, or sometimes
he has one of his assistants call.  He is kind of quirky sometimes - he
insists on setting up new members by phone so he can say hi to everyone (I
sure wouldn't want to have his phone bills!),  but you can place future
orders (after your first order) via E-mail.

He has some really friendly young ladies working for him, who seem to know
just as much as he does about this magazine stuff.  If you live overseas,
he will even call you there, as long as you are interested, but I think he
still makes all his overseas calls on the weekends, I guess cause the long
distance rates are cheaper then.

He only likes to take new members from referrals from satisfied existing
members and he does virtually no advertising.  When I got set-up, they had
a 2-3 week waiting list for new members to be called back so that they
could join up. (Once you are an existing member, they help you immediately
when you call. )  I think they are able to get back to prospective new
members  the same day or within a few days now, as they have increased
their staff.  I am not sure about this.........but if you email the above
form to them, that is the way to get started!

They will send you their DELUXE EMAIL CATALOGUE (around 525K-big and
juicey) !)...if you completely fill out the form above.  It has lists of
all the freebies, lists of all the titles they sell, titles broken down by
categories and detailed descriptions on nearly 1,200 of the titles that
they sell.

They then send you email  that outlines how his club works and the list of
free choices that you can choose from, as well as the entire list of what
he sells;  and then they will give you a quick (3-5 minute) friendly,
no-pressure no-obligation call to explain everything to you personally and
answer all your questions.

Once you get in, you'll love them. I do.


Sincerely,

Shyamala Raperjee


ps.  please forward a copy of this message to all your friends on the net
who you think might be interested in it!  It is a great deal!  If you join
and then they join after you, you will earn a free 1 yr. subscription for
each new person you get to join after you join!   If you exceed 25
referrals, they let you use them to give away as gifts, for Christmas,
Chanukah or any other occasion.  Please be kind enough to mention my name
when you join.   I will then get a free magazine for a year for referring
you.
Thank you.

...so what part of this don't you understand?  You save the file in your 
home directory on the unix server and then use zmodem to download it to 
your local hard drive...you've done part of the job..just finish it off!

   This is no longer Pine-related, but FreeNet .resource files are stored in
a separate directory from your work directory where you see all your files.
So, if this would work, you would probably need to read ../.newsrc or ~/.newsrc
or comparable.  But I suspect this has been disabled.

Subject: Racist newsgroup proposal alert!

There is currently a proposal for the newsgroup rec.music.white-power,
an attempt by neo-nazi racists to legitimize their activities. It is now
in the CFV stage, where anyone with a valid e-mail address may vote.

"White power" racist music is not a legitimate form of music deserving of
a separate rec.music newsgroup, but rather a political group masquerading
as a musical one. And, the rec.* hierarchy is inappropriate because rec.*
is for recreational activities, and racism is anything but recreational.

But, most importantly, we must show the racists that they will not be
granted a mainstream forum in order to promote hate. If you don't want
a Usenet where minorities feel unwelcome and uncomfortable, vote NO on
rec.music.white-power. Let's make this a crushing defeat for racists.

To vote, send e-mail to music-vote@sub-rosa.com and put

I vote NO on rec.music.white-power

in the body of the message.

The actual CFV can be found on news.announce.newsgroups,
or by sending a blank e-mail to music-cfv@sub-rosa.com.

Voting ends 23:59:59 UTC, 18 Mar 1996, so act quickly!

Pine supports MH folders.

Your .mh_profile file must define the Path:.  Maybe you have a tab after
"Path:" instead of a space?

Why should tin  look at the setup used by pine?
Why should pine look at the setup used by tin?

Why don't you setup both tin and pine to use the same signature file?
Why don't you RTFM?

    Pine will not do this for you.  You need to use some other program
which will presort the incoming mail into folders before Pine gets hold
of it.  Two popular programs for doing this on Unix systems are Filter
and Procmail.  If you have a Web browser, browse my home page and
follow the link to Nancy McGough's pages.  After you follow a few links
there, she has material on mail filtering.

Yes, you can set up a nick-name that expands to a list of e-mail addresses.

Go into Pine's Address Book screen and look at the menu at the bottom of 
the screen.  You want to try the "S" and "Z" commands.

Check that libgdbm.so.2 is on your system.  It normally is in
/usr/lib.  If it isn't, try finding it with the "find" command.

Hi.  Does anyone know of a way to permanently change the order of 
the messages in a a folder?  Because I changed the way my messages 
are sorted and saved, everytime I open my folders, Pine has to take 
a few moments to sort.  Is there a way to sort my messages and then 
SAVE them in that order so it doesn't have to sort every time I open 
the folder?

Thanks.

It works only if the file is in text format. I download it using the "sz" 
command. The text file gets downloaded onto my hard drive, as I wish. 
But, if the file is in another format (e.g., MS Word), nothing ends up on 
my drive. ZTerm reports that there were "too many errors" to process the 
request: "Data CRC error@o".

You can get pine to read your inbox, it even does an inc at the
appropriate times (at startup and when you ask to see new mail). In
addition to setting your folder collections set your inbox-path also
like this:

# Path of (local or remote) INBOX, e.g. ={mail.somewhere.edu}inbox
# Normal Unix default is the local INBOX (usually
/usr/spool/mail/$USER).
inbox-path=#MHINBOX

Subject: Having pine 3.92 understand URLs....
Date: 18 Mar 1996 17:33:46 GMT
Message-Id: <4ik6pq$prv@bcrkh13.bnr.ca>

IWBNI pine 3.92 or some later version understood URLs embedded in
message text.  For example:  I receive a message that includes URLs, I
press the "follow URLs" command key, pine prompts me with a list of
numbered URLs from the message body and asks which one I would like to
follow:  when I select one, pine fires off an external program to handle
that URL.

The config menu would include a mapping between URL type and external
application to use to against that type.  For example, ftp URLs would
activate an ncftp session to retrieve the named file.  Configuration of
the external URL handler would be up to me, and would not be done from
within pine.  Configuration information would include whether to process
the URL inline/in the foreground (fork and exec handler, wait for
handler to complete, handler takes over the screen) or offline/in the
background (fork and exec handler, handler detaches, pine doesn't wait
around).  Even better would be the ability to send into the background a
URL being handled in the foreground (the ability to recall it later is
not necessary, though IAWBN).

I have two questions regarding unix pine, the first is: How do I disable 
the suspend (^z) command in unix pine. My users get hung, and besides 
they have no need for suspending processes.

The other question is: I have a file that I want to to use as an email 
template. I thought I would just tell my users to us the ^r to pull up 
the template. The problem is that with permissions such as they are on my 
machine, I would have to create a copy for each user's home dir. Does 
anyone have a good solution?

Thanks in advance.

	I have too often "replied" to a group when I really meant to 
reply to an individual.  (I know that pine asks me if I want to send it 
to a different address or to all recipients and that I have to say "yes" 
if I do, but I repeatedly find that my fingers are working faster than my 
mind.)  Is there any way to disable these functions so I have to manually 
*add* a cc if I want to send the document to a group?  I would be 
grateful (and my many correspondents would be really grateful) if you 
could suggest a solution.

Hi,

Is it possible to block mail from certain domains. If so, how and do you do it 
with pine or somewhere in your shell. 

thanx in advance, dennis

    Pine cannot do this, but yes, procmail certainly can.  Good
procmail documentation (if any exists) can show you how, and there is
a procmail mailing list (unfortunately I do not have the address at
hand).  If nothing else, you can set up procmail recipes to have mail
from specific senders delivered to /dev/null, although I have heard
that this is not the most effcient way to do it.

Subject: Printing PC-PINE mail in a duplex-printing environment
Date: 18 Mar 1996 14:33:27 GMT
Message-Id: <4ijs7n$3t3@hobbes.cc.uga.edu>

Hi!

I've been reading this newsgroup off and on for about a year now and have 
just run into my first problem.

One of the users here has just gotten a nifty duplex printing HP LaserJet 
4M+ and the duplexing tray.  We've set her up to print under WordPerfect 
6.0 and Windows 3.1 so that it will print singly or doubly according to 
that programs' specifications.

Now, as I can see it, most of her documents are going to be single-page 
and 90% of the time she will be able to handle having a ^L addended to 
her print job in order to make the duplexer spit out her one printed page.

Am I overlooking something obvious?  Am I making her job more complicated 
than it already is (okay, okay, the duplexer is admittedly a little more 
than anyone else has in our environment)?  If you have any helpful 
suggestions, I'm more than happy to listen and learn!

Thanks!

To whom it may concern:
Lately I had some dificulties to download files from my mailbox.
After specifying where to save the file, overwritting it and pressing Y 
for printing I am getting the following message:
formatting error: error writting pipe: error writting attachment to 
"/u/dradojev/...
What shall I do to overcome this problem ?; everything worked fine until 
a few days ago.

Not necessarily; it depends on the target system. When I sent messages to 
my sister-in-law with the Return-Receipt field, I got back a response 
when she accessed the message. Something like

user foobar accessed your message at Jan 5 8:05 AM.

This seem to be exception, but it does exist.

   (a) going to the bottom of the index and hitting N five times (this

In three months using PINE, I've amassed about 60 different folders for 
saved messages.  Right now, they are all housed in the original default 
"Folders-collection'' folder list.

Is it possible to subdivide my "Folders-collection" into 5 or 10 
different "folders collections"?  For example, there would be one 
complete folder-collection for messages to relatives called "Family", 
with separate folders for each person.  Perhaps another for some of my 
favorite newsgroup postings called "Newsgroup", divided by topic.  
Another folder-collection would be for professional correspondence, with 
separate folders for each business contact. And so on.

How can I create these additional Folder-collections?  How can I name 
them?  And Can I transfer messages from one folder-collection into another?

CAUTION:
-------
This method should work on folders other than the INBOX.  It _may_ not
work on the INBOX, and _won't_ work for Usenet News groups.

To be 100% safe you should make a backup of your folder before doing this
technique (although I haven't lost any messages yet doing it, but have
never run out of disk space part way through either!:-)


PREPARATION:
-----------
The following assumes you are using Pine 3.91, and also have the 
"enable-aggregate-command-set" option selected in the Setup Configuration 
screen (S then C from the Main Menu).  If you don't, you will need to do 
this first.


METHOD:
------
1.  			Open the folder you wish to sort.
2.  $ ...		Sort the folder ($ then the sort method).
3.  ; A			Select all the messages in the folder.
4.  A S foldername	Apply a Save to the selected messages, and save them
			back into the same folder.
5.  ^L			Check that the messages appear in the folder: each
			should now be there twice - once as the old message,
			marked for Delete, once as the newly saved message.
6.  X			Expunge the deleted messages from the folder.


NOTE:
----
This has sorted the actual order in which the messages are stored in your 
folder.  Thus if you now display the folder sorted by "arrival" (actually 
the order in which the messages appear in the folder) you'll get an index 
of all your messages in the order you want, quickly.

However if you leave the folder set to sort "by <some method other than 
arrival>" I suspect you won't see much, if any, speed improvement as Pine 
still needs to check through the folder to see if it needs re-ordering 
according to the selected sort method.


Cheers,

You could contact them and ask them!

Seriously, there are mechanisms to *request* a message be sent back to 
you automatically when your message is delivered and/or read.

However whether these requests are actually honoured depends on whether:

*  The mail delivery software (for delivery receipt requests) or mail
   reading software (for read receipt requests) actually supports the
   feature, and

*  Whether the feature is enabled or not by the System Administrator/user.

Pine 3.91, for example, does not include support for automatic 
acknowledgement of messages that have been read.  (Some people, 
including myself, consider such automatic notification an invasion of my 
privacy ... why should my software tell you when I've read your message?!)

Cheers,

    Probably the simplest way is to put *yourself* in the To: field and
the distribution list in the Bcc: field (use Rich Headers if you need to). 
Then all the list recipients will only see his/her own address when the
mail actually arrives.  (You need to put something in the To: field to
protect yourself from some mailers.)

Certainly is.  Go to Setup/Config from the Pine main menu.  There is 
a listing for folder-collections.  Simply put the directories you want 
there. 

>For example, there would be one complete folder-collection for 
>messages to relatives called "Family", with separate folders for each person.  

Using your example above, the folder-collections list would be:

folder-collections     = mail/[]                                                
                         mail/Family/[]                                   

>How can I create these additional Folder-collections?  How can I name 
>them?  And Can I transfer messages from one folder-collection into another?

Simply create a directory, and copy any existing folders to that directory.
Then add the directory to your folder-collections as above.  A sample of 
my folder collections is below:

This note is to announce the availability of the Pine Message System
version 3.92.  This release represents an evolutionary step forward in
Pine functionality.  Nearly every facet of Pine's behavior has been
improved in one way or another.

In the interest of brevity, the full list of changes and enhancements
isn't included here, but some of the main improvements are:

   o Optional message filtering hooks (can be used for PGP integration)
   o Extensive address and list management improvements
   o Additional printing capabilities
   o Improved MIME and non-ascii support (mime.types, 1522, 8BITMIME)
   o Improved PC-Pine for Windows (GUI amenities & 32bit version)
   o Some modest performance improvements
   o Many new personal-preference options and command improvements
   o Hooks for integral file transfer between desktop computer & Unix Pine
   o Builtin signature editor
   o Improved user feedback when Pine is busy or waiting

A more detailed list can be found in the built-in release notes ("R" off
the Main Menu).  Even more information can be found via:

        http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine
and:
        ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs

Please bear in mind the following caveat:  While we believe this version
is reasonably stable, we consider it a "beta" code release.  It has been
exposed to limited testing, but has yet to be proven in a production
environment.

Pine version 3.92 source is available in:

        ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/pine.tar.Z
and
        ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/pine.tar.gz

PC-Pine in available in:

        ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/pcpine

and precompiled binaries for the various systems we have direct access to
are available in:

        ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/unix-bin
and
        ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/unix-bin-compressed

We'd like to thank the countless many who have taken the time to send us
valuable bug reports and suggestions, and welcome any comments you may
have regarding this release.  We hope you find Pine 3.92 useful!

Sincerely,

The Pine Development Team

    My apologies in advance for this lengthy posting, which I am crossposting
in English to the Czech/Slovak discussion group, when a short notice would
probably have been more than adequate...

    This new release of Pine is being unofficially mirrored for the benefit
of users in the Czech Republic, and in Slovakia, and in locations which are
a quick hop away when you don't want to struggle to get the program from
its original source at ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/pine.tar.Z  or in
GNU zipped form as pine.tar.gz.

    Users in CZ can find most of the Pine release available from
ftp://ftp.radio.cz/mail/pine
This will include the source and binaries as found on the Washington server.
There are also parts of the IMAP archive from here and from CMU available
for people who want to make use of the IMAP capabilities of Pine.  However,
there is no guarantee that the IMAP utilities available are as up-to-date
as they are on the servers from which they were obtained.  Please be patient
if the entire release is not yet available -- the connection from here is
slow and heavily-used, which is why I make this mirror available.

    Users in SK may use this FTP server, or may find it easier to obtain
this release from Kosice at
ftp://ftp.tuke.sk/pub/barry.bouwsma/pine   (no, I didn't set this up.)
However, from this server, you will probably only find the source code in
gzipped form, docs, the PC-Pine versions, and gzipped Linux binaries.

    The original distribution is of course at ftp.cac.washington.edu, and
users are advised to turn to this server for the most authoritative versions
of Pine.  I will PGP-sign those files which I have made available, but this
should not be taken as proof that the files are authentic -- instead a
trusted user should obtain the releases from Washington and verify that the
copies I have made available have not been altered from the official copies.
My PGP public key can be found by fingering  barryb@ccsun.tuke.sk .  Note
that I have no connection with the Pine authors, and am merely providing
this mirror, as well as my dubious claim that the programs have not been
tampered with, as a courtesy for users in this part of the world who would
rather not suffer through the hideously slow (when successful) FTP transfers
one is lucky to have by day.

    I am also making available a binary for SGI, compiled on IRIX5.3, for
users who want to place these binaries in /usr/local/bin or some similar
appropriate place.  This will be on the radio.cz FTP site.  You will have
to wait for an inst'able release to be provided from elsewhere.  You may
probably want to get the SGI binary from elsewhere anyway to be sure that
the version you run e-mails your password to someone else and not to me.
(1/2 :-)



The remainder of this announcement is being posted only to pine-info, which
is available as comp.mail.pine .  However, because it will be several days
until this post is seen here via Usenet, I am making this personal announcement
available from the radio.cz FTP server as /mail/pine/zpravy .

Greetings!

I just downloaded Pine 3.92 and compiled it and it works great!  Great job
everyone!

I noticed in the Release notes it says that I can now have different
usernames on different IMAP servers.  However I can't seem to get this to
work.  I have my incoming folders setup as :

	{host.domain.com}INBOX,
	so on and so forth.

How do I tell Pine what Username to use ?

Thanks for such a great product!

Michael

Greetings!

I downloaded Pine 3.92 today and have been extremely impressed!  However I
have found something that is different, that I can't find mention of in
the documentation.

I did a build osf on my machine and go Pine compiled and running.  I
entered Pine and all worked well.  I pressed <TAB> to switch through my
folders, and it prompts me for my username and password on the first of 4
IMAP hosts.  Fine.  I enter them and it Pine dutifully checks my email on
those hosts.  Then it searches my local folders (Pine and Procmail make a
powerfull combination!) and returns me to my INBOX.  Great!

About 5 minutes later, I press <TAB> again, and Pine goes and prompts me
for my Username on two of the four IMAP servers.  Whoa.  3.91 always
remembered the Username and password for the session (until I exited
Pine).  Is this a feature of the new ability to have the .pinerc contain
the username automatically ?  Or is it just me ?


Thanks!

Michael

Is that the complete error message?  Is it possible you are over-quota

Ask your system administrator.  It may be possible to retreive the

Thanks!  That also fixes the problem I was seeing with the passwords being

In Pine 3.92, you can select the quell-status-message-beeping feature
and/or set mail-check-interval to 0 to disable new mail checking
entirely.

To completely disable suspend for all users, set

If you have the current Pine 3.92 release, go to the Setup/Config
screen and set the "download-command" to the command to download a
file, e.g. "sz".  Then the Export command and SaveAttachment commands
will have a "^V" option to download the message/attachment directly to
your computer.

There is a "Hebrew Pine" floating around that does support
bi-directional editing.  The necessary patches have not been
incorporated into Pine, but we do plan to do something similar at some
point...

We are planning to add some form of directory service support in Pine
4.something, but in the mean time you could set up a cron script to
build a global-addressbook that Pine could use.  6000 entries should
be quite manageable by Pine...

In the config menu, check the settings of fcc-name-rule and
default-fcc.  Those variables determine where to save a copy of
outgoing messages.

WinBiff 3.3 c has been released, and is available at

  ftp://ftp.tucows.com/tucows/wnbff33c.zip

On CompuServe, look for WNBFF33C.ZIP in the NOVUSER forum.

The WinBiff home page is http://www.pacengr.com/winbiff/winbiff.htm.

WinBiff is an email notification program that works with a number
of different mail agents, including Pegasus Mail, Eudora for Windows,
cc:Mail, MS Mail, and new in this release, MS Exchange.  WinBiff also
is a POP3 and IMAP client under WinSock.

This update fixes a couple of small bugs.

This is a known bug in the base Pine 3.91 release.  You need either
the init.c patch for Pine 3.91 (see the Setup/Updates screen) or the
current Pine 3.92 release.

It kind of looks like the pine/os-lnx.c didn't get constructed for
some reason.  Try a "build clean" and watch for errors making the
os-lnx.c file...

In the current Pine 3.92 release, you can set alt-addresses in the
Setup/Config screen so that Pine can match your address(es).

Pine, as distributed by UW, does support MIME news reading and
posting.  However, I noticed that you are running a modified version
of Pine, which may have different behavior.  Check with the author of
whatever patches you are using for details.

BTW, the current Pine 3.92 release has a feature that allows you to
post 8-bit text, thus avoiding Quoted-Printable encoding in newsgroups
that don't like MIME.....

In the new Pine 3.92 release, you can set up "sending-filters" in the
Setup/Config screen.  Pine will then prompt you to pass the composed
message through one of the listed filters before sending it out.
Getting that to do what you want is left as an exercise ;-)

In Pine 3.92, you are given the option to post, reply by e-mail, or
both post and reply.  This is different from, and hopefully more clear
than, the old Pine 3.91 behavior.

The new Pine 3.92 release doesn't include integrated PGP support, but
it can be implemented fairly easily using the "display-filters" and
"sending-filters" features.  I would be suprised if scripts don't
start showing up soon...

I'm not that familiar with NeXTMail, but if the message has a
well-defined string that you could key on, you could write a
"display-filter" script to handle the decoding...

I should have mentioned that "display-filters" are a new feature of
Pine 3.92...

In the new Pine 3.92 release, you can set "reply-indent-string" in the

I see the "Bounce" command but that looks like it is "per message". 
How do I do a temporary auto-bounce (of all messages) -- for example to 
forward all mail going to my office to my home e-mail address while I am 
working at home.

Date: Mon, 18 Mar 1996 22:54:11 GMT

I thought about this over the weekend, I felt like maybe I was too
rude to the guy from Sun who initially asked how to make Pine/imapd
honor Content-Length: headers.

Anyway, I thought about how to "do it right" and here's the proposal,
for the only possible way to "do it right". 

The biggest problem with Content-Length as an Internet (rfc822) HEADER
is that it really doesn't belong there at all. Mail Transfer Agents
have no business computing and updating a content length HEADER,
although there IS an ESMTP extension to indicate message
length. Existing Mail User Agents freely muck with certain selected
headers (X-Status for example) and have no obligation to
respect/update a Content Length among the HEADERS.

Instead, your stored content length belongs as an attribute only of a
message SEPARATOR LINE as stored in a local mailbox file, to be
STRIPPED OFF before transmission.

(similar to how the initial Unix From line is only used as a separator
in the mailbox, and is stripped off before transmission)

You are trying to add a new feature to the existing, well established
mbox file format, a feature (fixed length which must be computed and
stored/updated in Content-Length header) which contradicts a basic
mbox assumption (free format of headers/text, can be added/changed
arbitrarily subject to rfc 822/1123 restrictions, after initial From
line).

SO, here's the proposal: you will have to define yet another mailbox
file format, call it "clmbox". Write a new driver for imapd/c-client,
based on the mbox driver. Change the local mail delivery agent and the
mail applications on your system (Solaris, presumably) so they all
understand the new format and all respect/preserve its main attribute:

Each message in the new clmbox mailbox format would START with a
single separator line, perhaps in this format: "Content-Length [n
bytes] From [usual From line stuff]".

Thus the imapd and c-client would still be able to determine the
mailbox format from reading the first line of the file, as they do
now.

Note that imapd/c-client already HAVE at least one fixed-length
format, namely the "mtext/tenex" format, in which a message begins
with a line that starts with a MM-DD-YY (or YYYY?) date, followed by
octal flag bytes, including the content length.

The mtx c-client/imapd driver respects this content length,
recomputing it as necessary when rewriting a message to a mailbox
file. It makes sense to have this computed number appear in the
initial out of band separator line, AT THE BEGINNING of the message it
refers to..... rather than a header stuck randomly somewhere in the
middle of the Internet rfc822 header set....

So what would you gain from introducing a new clmbox mailbox format,
instead of just using mtext/tenex? Good question. Maybe Solaris should
adopt the mtext/tenex format as its native mailbox format, if you
really really need to have a computed content length for a Solaris
mail user agent?

On the other hand, remember that mtext/tenex mailbox handling involves
actions which are not reliable when the mailbox is accessed via NFS...

Message-Id: <4ihaqq$c0q@lyra.csx.cam.ac.uk>

Pine allows you to edit an addressbook's Fcc field, which specifies
the folder to which a message will be automatically saved.  However,
this occurs only when you send a message to that person.  Is there any
way to set this up to save a message received from that person?

I know the saved-msg-name-rule can be set to save the message
automatically by the name of the sender, but that creates too many
folders for my preference.

Message-Id: <4ikskb$k66@slip.net>
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Does anybody know if there is a way to make PINE display the entire
subject line of newsgroup headers in a listing of articles?  Many of the
binary groups seem to have very long subject lines and the only way I can
read them is to display the whole the message.  This can be very time
consuming if the "text" is very long. I was hoping there was a setting
that would allow the full 80 columns of the subject field to be viewed
without calling up the whole message. 

Also does anybody know the correct syntax to pipe a binary article to sz 
for download directly to my terminal without having to export and exit 
PINE first?

Thanks in advance for any help.

Pine 3.92 has several variations of saved-msg-name-rule that use the
Fcc...

If you have access to Pine 3.92, you might experiment with the
index-format in the Setup/Config screen to see if you can come up with
something better for you.

In Pine 3.92, set "download-command=sz" in the Setup/Config screen.

Neither of these features are available in Pine 3.91 or earlier.

    What should happen when you answer "no" to the question "Move sent-mail
to 'sent-mail-prev-month'?"  Our local documentation says that the messages
in sent-mail will be purged, but that's not my experience.  I've searched
all the documentation I can find for the answer to this, with no luck.

Hi,

I have a problem...

Our sys admin prevents the sending of mail to the 'outside world', unless 
logged into machine Y. I do most of my work from a workstation - machine 
X. Is it possible for pine to rewrite the sending header to make my mail 
look as if it has been sent from machine Y.
I think you can do this with the sendmail configuration file, but can it 
be done from pine. If not - I will settle for some help on changing my 
sendmail.cf.

martini.

Hello,

to compile the source code for Linux running kernel 1.3.59 I had to make
some changes to the sources (see attached file). These had to do with
changing some of the compiler and linker flags, and the definition of the
variable errno in many of the source files. This variable should not be
defined by any program, just include <errno.h> for the definition.

Kind regards,

Kees de Bruin

Washington does not support the VAX/VMS platform.

There are (AFAIK) a couple of commercial ports to VAX/VMS; there is
(I know - I run it) also a free port, by Yehavi Bourvine at HUJI
in Israel.

To read my notes about the latter, try here.

http://ppewww.ph.gla.ac.uk/%7Eflavell/

you'll find an appropriate pointer to the software too.

When I try to fetch the new pine 3.92 I can't login to the ftp

(username) ftp

Can that be fixed ?

This patch fixes the linker errors, but does not resolve the problem
I have with sending mail via Pine.  Unless I have an smtp server
defined in either ~/.pinerc or in /usr/local/lib/pine.conf, Pine 3.92
gives an error and will not send mail on two Linux boxes that I have
tried it on.

On these same systems Pine 3.91 works perfectly, without an smtp server
defined in the Pine configuration files (i.e it is able to use 
/usr/lib/sendmail) ......

Hi, folks!

Just got Pine 3.92 - looks very promising!! Much thanks for good work
done!

But two questions:

1. I cannot find sendmail-path parameter in Config screen. Is it
intentional? Should I always edit .pinerc to get it?

2. It is now possible to send 8bit plain text over SMTP channel. What
about local sendmail? Can I specify 8BITMIME body type and tell Pine to
just pass 8 bit over?

To put it other way - how do I send 8 bit text with local MTA?

Thanks in advance

Subject: Pine aborting when one tries to include a file in the compose screen
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

We have the following somewhat strange setup on our machines

	A novell netware server which is running as an NFS server (don't ask)
	exporting home directories for about 3000 users.

	4 Sparc Ultras running Solaris 5.5 that NFS mounts these home
		         directories, as well as other home directories from
dedicated NFS
        servers.

	(We had 5 RS6000 running AIX3.2.5 which with the same setup exhibited
	 the same behavior).

	Users run zmail from NCD as well as pine 3.9.1 on these servers with
	the following problems occuring for the users whose home directories
	are mounted from the Novell server, who have a large number of
	files in the current directory (> 50), and who run pine:

		User goes to the compose screen starts to compose a message
		and then decides to include a file, they do ^r^t and
immediately
		pine crashes with the following error:

		     Bug in Pine detected: "Received abort signal".

		the .pine-crash files has the following:

		     Pine Panic: Received abort signal

	The same home directory with the same files mounted from the dedicated
	NFS servers do not exhibit this problem. I was told that on the vax
	pine used to behave like this also.

	Please note that pine 3.9.2 also does the same thing but zmail does
not.

	Does anyone know a possible cause for this ?

[continued from my response to the general announcement:]


    Features of this new release of Pine which may be of special interest
to users in CZ/SK, as well as to users anywhere, include...

* Support for 8BITMIME ESMTP dialog, when configured to do this and when
talking to a SMTP server which supports this, such as BSD Sendmail 8.7.*.
This means that instead of always sending text with non-ASCII characters
as QUOTED-PRINTABLE (or quoted-unreadable :-), you have the possibility to
send your message with 8-bit characters when the recipient announces
support for 8BITMIME.

* Support for RFC1522 headers, which will allow your name to look as ugly
as my name does here, and permit you to use your native character set in
e-mail and news headers.

* Support for 8-bit NNTP transfer for news articles.  Earlier this month,
the central Czech news server appears to have been retired and replaced by
one running more up-to-date code, and for the first time, it's possible to
read news originating outside of CZ and SK with 8-bit data intact, although
with still a several day delay.  This will mean that you can also send
newsposts this way -- while a little bit controversial, it is a widely-
accepted practice.

* A way to enter 8-bit characters, even if the keyboard drivers do not
allow one to do so directly, by ESC-ESC-decimalcode for the desired char.

* One can now configure the DELETE key on many keyboards to perform a
forward-character-deletion, as one may know it from the PC keyboard.

* Support for external programs to be called when displaying or sending a
message.  One possible use of this is to provide a translation from and to
the Windows code page 1250 which is widely used in CZ/SK, to make those
characters which differ from the recommended ISO-8859-2 Internet on-the-
wire character set match with Micro$oft's idea of that character set, in
a manner similar to the ISO_TO_CP and CP_TO_ISO tables which PC-Pine can
use to translate ISO-8859-2 to and from CP852 or Kamenicky or whatever.
I have not verified this for the final release, but the source code for the
preliminary releases looked like it did not make use of these tables when
one was using Pine on a Windows machine.

* Support for a mime-types file to permit labelling of MIME attachments in
mail sent, beyond those types supported in previous releases of Pine.

* Support for the mouse under the X-Windows system when configured for
this, as well as support for new mail notification in an X icon.  Mouse
support can also be enabled for the standalone Pico editor as ``pico -m''.
The appearance of Pine will still be the same character-based program, but
one will now be able to click on the names of commands to execute them,
or select messages this way, plus select and paste text.  Note that you
need to use the shift key along with the mouse buttons for selecting and
pasting text.

* Too many more to list here.


    These are some of the more significant features of this new release,
and present Pine users will also see improvements in the way it operates.
You are advised to look to the release notes for a broader overview of all
that is new, improved, or fixed from the previous releases.


    Here are some notes of general interest I have from working with the
pre-releases that have led up to this final product which is tantalizingly
close to you:

    There are a number of new options, such as the mouse support.  You
should probably run this new Pine, read the mildly overwhelming Release
notes which are available from the Main menu, as well as being found in the
docs/ directory of the FTP server and mirrors, and then go directly to the
configuration screen.  There you can select the options you wish to be
available to you -- at any point, you should use ^G to Get help about a
particular option.  When you've selected all the options which are appealing
to you, you should exit and save the configuration options, then I suggest
you quit and restart Pine.  If you don't, there seem to be some options
which do not completely take effect.  Starting fresh seems to correct this.

    If you want to take advantage of the X support, you will need to run
Pine in an xterm, and one way to do this is to create an alias for pine,
which starts an xterm running Pine, with the font to match your charset.

    As noted, the external program hooks could be used to provide a quick
translation from the over-the-wire character set to that which is in use
locally for the display, and to convert back to the over-the-wire character
set.  This has obvious applications for the Windoze code page used in
central and eastern Europe, which has slight differences from the desired
ISO-8859-2 charset.  The disadvantage is that this conversion is only in
effect for the message body and does not include the headers.  At least
Pine will get the charset tagging in the headers correct, unlike certain
commercial products, if you have your charset value specified properly.
I would have preferred a more general expansion of the DOS Pine ISO_TO_CP
principle to also handle Windows (if not also Unix where some Windows-based
telnet application is in use), but since Nyetscape blew off the CE Windows
users also, I'm happy there are these hooks, even though many users will
likely want to make use of the hooks for messages with particular strings,
like  -----BEGIN ...

    One might be able to use these external program hooks to echo the xterm
escape sequence which can be used to dynamically change the font used in
the display to match messages received in different character sets.  I have
not experimented with this yet.

    It appears from my work with the final pre-release that at least for
some platforms, there may be difficulties in displaying certain characters
in some character sets, which have printable characters in positions where
the ISO 8859 series of character sets do not.  Users who stick to, say,
ISO-8859-2, will not have problems.  However, users who want to support
the Windows CE code page may have difficulties, as may users who would
work with MIME character sets such as KOI8-R.  If this turns out to be a
problem, I have confidence that the Pine authors will be able to make a
fix available for this in reasonably short notice.  Not that I want to
speak for them, but people who have worked with them in getting this new
release out to you know they are very responsive to this sort of problem.

    To take proper advantage of the ESMTP 8BITMIME support, you must set up
Pine as an SMTP client -- that is, to set the value of the SMTP server to be
some machine, probably your mailhub or mailhost.  If this machine is running
a mailer such as Sendmail 8.7.5 which announces 8BITMIME support, then your
message can be transferred as an 8-bit message.  If you are running an old
version of Sendmail, such as 8.6.13 or some IDA variant or even 4.1 (ack),
you will probably want to obtain and install the latest sendmail, which
should not be terribly difficult, or any of several other mailers which also
have 8BITMIME support.  Of course, this is a job for the administrator of
your system if you are only the end user.

    The .mime.types file which Pine expects to see must be in the format
content-type<whitespace>extension[<whitespace>extensions...]   like
  application/x-foo        foo  bar  baz
which matches the Mosaic mime-types file.  However, it seems that Netscape
makes use of a .mime.types file, should you happen to copy it to your own
directory for use, with a format
  type=(content-type)<whitespace>[encoding<whitespace>]exts=(extensions-
  comma-separated)[<whitespace>icon=some-bitmap]
    Pine cannot yet parse this, though it should be a simple matter to
write code to handle this or any other extant mime-types file and contribute
it to <pine@cac.washington.edu> who would be happy to incorporate it into
the next release.  As an alternative, if you have such a .mime-types file,
you can use your favorite editor to gut the ``type='' and ``exts='' and
convert any commas to whitespace.  Pine should be happy with the file that
results, even if Netscape may barf.  The next Pine release should rationalize
this somewhat -- there wasn't time to cram it into this release.

    The ESC-ESC-decimal means of entering an 8-bit character, when there
is no easy way to enter it directly from the keyboard, works well when you
know what the decimal number representation of the character you desire
happens to be.  This will probably require a table of the commonly used
characters from your language and their decimal equivalents in the
character set you happen to use.  For example, I know that the u-diaeresis
(or German u with umlaut) has decimal position 252 in both the common
Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1) encoding, as well as in the ISO-8859-2 which is more
likely to be used in this country.  So if I'm sending messages to my banker
friends in Switzerland and want to impress them by putting a couple dots
atop their city's name, I would use the sequence of keystrokes...
Z-ESC-ESC-2-5-2-r-i-c-h    ...
if I don't have a keyboard with the character I want immediately available.
Of course, you may need to find a reference which lists all the characters
which are available in your selected character set, so that you know the
decimal codes for the position of each.  Never fear, there are such things
available on the Net for you.
    One of the worst, based on something I found several years ago and to
which I added additional character sets, can be retrieved as
ftp://ftp.radio.cz/charsets/iso8859
This is a rather lengthy text file, and the original was written in German,
and I added to it and never got around to cleaning it up or even adding
more to it to reflect additional ISO8859 character sets.  However, in this,
you will find a table of all the characters in a particular subset of 8859,
plus the hexadecimal and decimal codes for the position of each described
character in the table.  From this, you should be able to create a list of
any character which you need to type and its corresponding decimal number.
Do not trust this table for too much else -- while most of it is reliable,
it is work which used to be in progress but was put on the back burner and
the heat turned way down.


    My congratulations and thanks to all on the Pine Team for providing
still another release of Pine, which is easy enough for almost anyone to use,
yet powerful enough for advanced users, and includes built-in support for
MIME and 8-bit handling, making it useful for not only the intended Univ of
Washington community, but for users throughout the world.


    Sigh...  Fun's over.  Now back to Real Work...

I download mail from home on Netscape 2.0 as well as read it from school,
and there is already a file in my inbox that the IMAP server uses that is
read-only.  How can I make other messages that I receive read-only?
 
Thanks

There seems to be a bug in ucbmail under Digital UNIX V3.2C Worksystem
Software (Rev. 148) that messes up cc lines generated from a previous
pine generated message that has <>'s in the name portion next to
someone's address. Does DEC have a replacement for this or? A sample

The problem:

Pine 3.92 seems to have a (minor?) bug in computing Fcc for a given
address. If I use a mail-box format of To: address (just the address
without angle brackets, e.g. pine-info@cac.washington.edu) Fcc is ALWAYS
set to sent-mail, though fcc-name-rule is set to "by-recipient".

If I use route-address (e.g. <pine-info@cac.washington.edu>), the Fcc is
correctly set to pine-info.

To reproduce:

start Pine;

set fcc-name-rule to "by-recipient";

go to Compose; give any address in the To: field, press
RETURN; you won't get Fcc header. If you look into it with ^R you will see
just sent-mail.

now cancel composer and start once again; give the same address in angle
brackets - you correctly get Fcc set to user name.

I checked it with Pine 3.91 - it works correctly there.

The same problem with address book entries. If address is given without
angle brackets, Fcc: is always set to sent-mail.

the configuration I use is almost the same as with Pine 3.91 - a couple of
features changed against default values.

We are running Pine (Unix) on a Sequent S81. We add and delete users via
the DYNIX/ptx software. We have a problem when we delete a user and then 
try to add the same user back into the system. The problem is that after
the user has been added back to the system they get this message when 
they log in:  "mail: Invalid permissions". No mail ever gets to their
inbox however it does show up in /usr/mail/(userid). Does anyone know
what our problem is?

No, there actually was a problem with the FTP server this morning.
That problem has now been fixed.

When you delete the user, does /usr/mail/(userid) get deleted?  If
not, the user may have a different UID when you re-create the account,
while the mail spool is still owned by the old UID...

David,that is all what I can see on the monitor; who could I know if I am 
out of disk space or over-quota and what shall I do in that case...there 
is no local Pine support here in Calgary?!.

I have been using standard unix 'mail' for a long time. At times I would just
see the listing and read the mail and quit using 'x'. The mails would not be
marked read.

Is it possible in pine to read the mail and still have 'N' next to the message?

   Don't know whjat you exactly mean.
   I usually run Pine in a dedicated dxterm (and other people here do
   it in a dedicated xterm) window, and that's all what I need.
   (I've even seen posted a way to have a particular icon for that
   window, but I haven't kept sicne it doesn't work with dxterm)
   This for me it's all what I'd like to have by Pine under X.

   If you want anything more or different don't think so, but I
   won't consider it a "desirable" feature.

   (I'd like the same user interface when locally on my workstation
   console, and when elsewhere logged in remotely)

Why bother? Your outgoing posts are saved to the "sent-mail" folder

The specification to use would be:

    {imap.host/user=name}

    You need to specify the usernames as outlined above for this to work.
This allows people to have multiple IMAP logins on the same host.

    This meant that as soon as you logged in as one user to the host, you
could not log in as another user on the same host without some
sophisticated hacks.  Now you can, at the expense of having to specify
your username in the .pinerc to keep it in memory.

  I was hoping there'd be an FAQ on the subject, and maybe there is,
but its location is not obvious.  Can someone tell me how to get PINE
to forward all mail from one account to another?  Specifically, I have
an account with a freenet that uses PINE, and I want to forward all
that mail to a college account until I graduate in May.  Thanks.

Apologies if this message (or something alike) appears twice. I had some
problems with Pine (as outlined below).

I have also noticed this, but sometimes it all works without any problem,
but it can also hang the sendmail process. I now let Pine talk directly to
the SMTP port on our mail/news server and I don't have any problems (yet).

Reading a message within Pine automatically changes its "N" flag to space 
(ie, read).  When you quit out of Pine these changes are _always_ written 
to your mailbox; there is no "x" command equivalent to exit without updating.

You can achieve what you want in either of two ways:


1)  Change the flag back to "N" after reading the message.

To do this you must first enable the "flag" command; from Pine's main 
menu go to the Setup Configuration screen (S then C) and look down the 
list for the "enable-flag-cmd" feature.  Make sure this is enabled.

Return to your message then use the flag command to set the status flag 
back to "N":  * N

Voila!


2)  Open your INBOX read-only.  This prevents _anything_ from being 
changed (ie, status flags ... also prevents you deleting messages though!)

Do this by starting Pine with the "-o" command line option.  Thus to go 
straight into the INBOX's index screen but in read-only mode the command 
would be:

	pine -oi

Hi David,

	Questions:

1.) In PINE, the new version, can I as the user go directly to a message by
keying the number of the message? Old 3.91 version, this wasn't possible.

2.) Is PINE, able to run on a home computer not tied to any servers, for
the express purpose of downloading messages and replying OFFLINE and saving
the replies in a postpone-messages folder and uploading them to your server
and mailing the messages one at a time from the postpone-messages folder.

3.) Is there available to users of the PINE mail system, to download mail
folders from the Freenet site let's say and do the above with PINE or
another OFFLINE mail reader.

4.) Does PINE run under MS-DOS?

Thank you for your reply.  I have decided to do exactly the same.
However I do think that this is a bug in Pine 3.92 relative to 3.91
.... perhaps the developers can look into it at some point of time.

Ashok

I don't know what a 'display-filter' script is, or how to write one.

a 'well-defined string' is also a term I do not know.  There is a unique 
header line for each NeXTMail message.  The message itself will be simply 
uuencoded after being tar'd and compressed (the message will be 
message.tar.Z, then message.tar.Z is uuencoded and mailed).

Does that help any?

Thanks for the response...

We are running PC-Pine v. 3.92 on our system.  I was wondering if there is
a way to disable the message alert (you know, where it tells you that
there are so many new messages and who the most recent one is from).

I would appreciate any help you can give.

Thanks.

I haven't read the detail of the PINE changes yet, so perhaps this is
known. Or perhaps it has nothing to do with PINE. But quite often when
sending an Email with the new version, there is a rather long delay (a
"Sending 0%" message appears on the screen. AFter a minute, things start
moving again and everything is normal.

You can completely disable the new-mail check by setting
mail-check-interval=0 in the Setup/Config screen.

Hi!!  Could somebody please send me some info on how to fix certain 
incoming mail to go into certain folders instead of all my mail going

This feature would have been very nice but why does it not work for PC-Pine?

If I understand correctly, the new version of pine (3.92) has all
the necessary hooks to make a smooth PGP interface. Has anyone done
it already or planning to do it soon?

(I'm trying to avoid re-inventing the wheel. :-)

    Pine as such does not have this capability.  Because you refer to
"your shell," I presume you are using some kind of Unix system.  In
that case, you can use procmail or filter to preprocess mail to reject
incoming mail according to criteria you specify (such as a specific
domain).

I managed to get Pine 3.92 to build under BSD/OS 2.01 and 2.1 just now,
after making several minor changes (see below).

I no longer have access to a BSDI 1.x system, but my recollection (from
earlier build efforts) is that the changes I made here were =not= needed
for that older system.  Since there are still lots of people out there
running BSDI 1.x, the best solution may be for Pine to support two tar-
gets (one for 1.x, another for 2.x).

It's nearly impossible to get pine 3.92 from your ftp server.
It's totally overcrowded. You should have organized some mirrors
before the announcement ! Or please do it now.

This is most likely my stupidity but when I am using the PC-PINE 3.92 product

You could just get the bin instead of compiling it.  The bin's are ELF, 
and work fine for me (kernel 1.3.68).  Of course if you have special 
options you need to compile in, I haven't been much help...

Has anyone been able to build the Pine 3.92 distribution under BSD/OS

BSD/386), but an attempted build fails on my BSD/OS machine badly.  
Any hints, or patches I should know about?  Thanks.

The precompiled Pine binary does the exact same thing.  The problems
are not unique to my system, but seem to occur on other systems
running sendmail-8.7.x.  I am going to test the new Pine with
Sendmail-8.6.x next ......

 Pine cannot automatically sort email into folders on delivery.

However, it is possible to edit a file called .mailfilter to automatically
send files to different folders as follows:

if (!delivered && $(from)==/abc@cde.fgh/)
{
unixfile "mail/abc";
}

This places mail from abc@cde.fgh into the folder abc


if (!delivered && $(from)==/zyx@vwu.tsr/)
{
        delivered=TRUE;
}

Delete-on-delivery : you will NOT recieve any mail from zyx@vwu.tsr


if (!delivered)
{
unixfile "mail/INBOX";
}

This places any remaining mail into the inbox.


Hope this helps.

Upgrade to version 3.92

It asks you:

Followup to newsgroups, Reply by email to author, or Both?

And you have to press F, R, or B

Pressing Y will just produce an error message.

Hope this helps.

On the Uni of Wales Aberystwyth's OSF systems, there is a file called
.mailfilter in the mail direcotry which serves as an on-delivery sorting
device.

if (!delivered && $(from)==/abc@def.ghi/)
{
        delivered=TRUE;
}

Add this to your .mailfilter (if you have one) and you will NOT recieve
any mails from abc@def.ghi
 Obviously you can edit the address.

And whilst you're in the .mailfilter, if you want to sort incoming mail
into different folders:

if (!delivered && $(from)==/zyx@wvu.tsr/)
{
unixfile "mail/zyx";
}


This will put mail from zyx@wvu.tsr into folder zyx



if (!delivered)
{
unixfile "mail/INBOX";
}


Keep this, this tells all other mail to go into the inbox.

At UWA (Uni of Wales Aberystwyth) the 'supported mail programs' use mh,
but until demand is sufficient and the Pine development team include mh
support, Pine users here are stuck with having to use pine's own folder
system. No doubt it will be the same with your system.

The "/path_to_inbox" part is wrong.  Anything other than "inbox" here will
be rejected.

The basic answer to your message is that no, there are no plans to support
NeXTmail now or in the future.  Even NeXT has abandoned this format in
favor of MIME.

NeXTmail has a serious security problem due to its use of uudecode and
tar; you need "safe" versions of these.  Newer releases of Mail.app from
NeXT contains "safe" copies of both programs, after (as a demonstration to
prove the magnitude of the problem) I put together a piece of evil
NeXTmail that cracks any system which has a user foolish enough to read
the message.

NeXTmail also requires a RTF decoder.  Or rather, a NeXT RTF decoder;
every vendor's RTF is different.

You can pipe the message body to a shell script that will uudecode and
untar it, then execute an RTF viewer.  The new display-filter capability
in Pine 3.92 permits doing this automatically; read the documentation on
display-filter and any good Unix text on how to write shell scripts.

I must say, though, anybody who opens a NeXTmail format message
automatically without any security checks is a much braver man than I.  I
must *emphasize* that the security problem described above is very real,
especially on real NEXTSTEP systems.  We're talking email virus, folks.

Pine has included MH support since at least Pine 3.90.  The MH INBOX
can be specified with

	inbox-path=#MHINBOX

And your other folders in ~/Mail/ can be referenced with

	folder-collections=#MH/[]

Sub-folders are a bit tricker; you need to specify them as separate
collections, e.g. for the folders in ~/Mail/foo/, specify

	folder-collections=#MH/foo/[]

Putting the whole hierarchy in one collection will probably be
available in about Pine 4.1 (maybe even 4.0).

How come my copy of Pine 3.92 keeps putting To: comp.mail.pine in the
sender name area of the folder list instead of my 'full name' (Ben
Norwood)?

In pine 3.92 (IRIX 4.05) there is a handly little spinning ASCII "clock"
which tells you when there are delays accessing files. I like this feature
since it lets you know that pine hasn't crashed as it waits for minutes on
end for an NNTP server to respond. However, I find it even more
frustrating to know that the program is still running, but I still can't
do anything. I would like to be able to hit a key or key combo to tell the

     Is there a way to select an addressbook of your choice. I would like to 
create a central address with all the addresses and then the users will create 
their own address book. What I would like to do give a choice to switch 
between these two address books.

In order to add a digital signature to my outgoing messages, I have set
sending-filters to be:
   /usr/local/bin/pgp -fats

I have also added:
   compose-send-offers-first-filter
to the feature-list variable: this bit is optional.

In order to run pgp on messages that I view (i.e., other people's
messages), I have set display-filters variable to be:
   _LEADING("-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----")_ /usr/local/bin/pgp

Although I am happy with the outgoing bit, I would like more control over
the display-filters: (a) it's difficult to see what pgp is telling me ---
it leaves the screen too quickly, (b) it would be nice to be able to
toggle display-filtering on and off.  Having said that, these hooks in
Pine 3.92 that enable me to do digital signatures a lot easier are great.

How are other people enabling Pine 3.92 for PGP?

    Export the message.  Only the text parts of the message which Pine
displays will appear in the exported file.  If you are using Pine's
non-IMAP default, or an Elm-compatible variant of that, for your saved
message folders, Export the messages to something like
Mail/archive  or
mail/archive   (replace archive with the name of your choice)

    If you have need for full headers, enable them with ``h'' before you
Export the message.  Any attachments will be noted in the exported
message, but will not be there.

    For an IMAP configuration where you do not see your saved mail folders
directly, you will have to add a folder collection which points to the
local file where you have exported all the messages to your configuration.

    When you Export, you'll no doubt want to Append and not Overwrite.
But I think you'd figure that out after your first dozen or so mistakes
;-)

Message-Id: <slrn4kuv06.lrk.aiyar@ebv.oncology.wisc.edu>


Has anyone been able to successfully run Pine 3.92 under Linux?
Pine 3.92 seems to compile fine on my computers, but I am unable
to send mail - it quits with an error.  The same thing happens 
when I try the precompiled 3.92 binaries available on
ftp.cac.washington.edu

The systems I have tried are:

kernel-1.3.70
gcc 2.7.0
libc 5.0.9
sendmail 8.7.5

and

kernel 1.2.13
gcc 2.7.2
libc 5.2.18
sendmail 8.7.3

In both cases I created new global pine configurations using 
(pine -conf >/usr/local/lib/pine.conf), and tried Pine with and 
without the default global configuration.

In contrast Pine 3.91 works fine on both of these systems that 
I have tried it on.  

Any help would be much appreciated!

Hi,
I would like to archive all my correspondance, but I often send and
recieve large binary files.  I would like to be able to remove the
attachments from my messages before I archive them.
I have searched through the FAQ's for information reguarding a way to
remove attachments, but I haven't found one yet.  I have been manualy
deleting the encoded attachments and changing the content type in the
header, but this is *very* slow.  Can any one help me?

                        Thank you,
                                Jason

Well, if you don't want to read news with pine (and I don't see why you
would prefer pine to say tin...) remove the nntp server in your setup,
or define an unexsistend one, or put an empty value in.

Hope this helps.

In my experience, it does not create the new folder and keeps the sent

Hi,

Say, how about adding something to Pine so it doesn't load your entire
INBOX into memory?  I think Elm doesn't do that.  That's my biggest complaint
with Pine is that it's a system killer if you've got a bunch of people
with big INBOXes.

Sorry for the multiple posts.  Netscape's newsreader is a little buggy.  
Pine is much better!

I have to insist on my original posting even with the new pine 3.92.
When I do news posting either the

            [ ]  enable-8bit-nntp-posting

is set or not there is the strange situation where the news article
arrives on the nntp server with the Subject encoded in MIME (rfc1522)
and the body in 8bit text. Of course I have checked that the data
arrives in this form by vi'ing the file which keeps the article on
the nntp server where the news for out Net is kept.

Could you please tell me if I am missing something?

Thank you,

I apologize for the mistake.  The above should read:

/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|

In .pinerc define under incoming-folders:

"Description string" {pop3_hostname.domain/pop3}

/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|

Hope it helps.  It works for me.

Since the message is From: you, Pine assumes (by default) that the
more useful information is who you sent it To:.  You can change this
in Pine 3.92 by setting the index-format in the Setup/Config screen.
Read the Help text carefully before changing this though!!!

There are some places where we haven't found a feasible and/or
portable way to interrupt whatever Pine is working on.  But in many
places, you can press ^C to interrupt a long process...

Actually, imapd is an IMAP server for remote folder access.  Configure
this if you want to access folders from another machine.

This is basically a little diagnostic program for IMAP.  It doesn't
have much value for users...

PIne's Lister Of Things.  It is basically the file browser from
pine/pico stripped out for use as a file browser.  This is Pilot's
first public release, so let us know what you think!

Dear Pine People,

	I do believe there's something wrong with my Pine account.
For some reason I can't get into my inbox folder.  Instead of
opening the folder, I get this message:

	[[closed] IMAP connection broken (server response)]

Needless to say, this is a less than satisfactory response.

Please tell me what's wrong.  Please tell me how to fix it.

Waiting anxiously for your response,

The remains of ksotol

You can save outgoing messages into a folder: look in config and you
should see this:

default-fcc              = <No Value Set>

Press A, then type in sent-mail
Press RETURN and all outgoing mail should be saved to a folder called
sent-mail.

OK?

 I don't know if this occurs in version 3.92 (which I've just obtained),
but when using version 3.91 occasionally on send it would set the
content-transfer-encoding to QUOTED PRINTABLE which meant that on other
newsreaders some characters eg. the UK pound sign and carriage returns
appears as =03 and =20 respectively. Does this happen in version 3.92? If
so, is there any way of setting the content-transfer-encoding to 7bit?

Please read the Pine Technical Notes, in which it discusses different
mailbox formats and their implications on memory.

It is not possible to update in place a folder in standard Unix mbox
format or MMDF format due to the way that status information is written in
these formats.  In certain other formats (mtx, tenex, mh)  supported by
Pine, it is possible.

If Pine can not update in place, there are two implementation choices:
	1) use a scratch file
	2) keep an in-memory snapshot of the entire folder

At the time the Unix mbox format code was written, our users tended to be
on the very brink of their disk quotas.  They could not afford to have a
scratch file.  On the other hand, the machines in question had memory to
spare.  The in-memory snapshot can be very fast;  in particular, text
searches (;T command) are instantaneous.

On our systems, we have been moving towards tenex format on black-box IMAP
servers and away from mbox format.  Tenex (and mtx) format is memory-cheap
and reasonably fast (with the exception of ;T searches).

We *are* considering offering support for the scratch file technique in a
future version of Pine, because there are systems such as yours where disk
is cheap and memory is dear.  I can't give any timeline yet; we tend to
give higher priority to fixing bugs and missing functionality, and less
towards changing working code that doesn't affect us or our users.  But I
can tell you that it is seriously on our list now.

Is there any way to convince pine to *not* beep at me when I get new mail?

Thanks for any help --

Hi, all!

Here is the reason for the problem. The problem description once more:

  if I enter the To: address in mbox format (foo@bar.com), and
  fcc-name-rule rule is set to by-recipient, then fcc is not correctly set;
  it retains the default-fcc value.

  If the same address is entered in route-addr form (<foo@bar.com>),
  the fcc is correctly set to "foo".

Reason:

  after user entered the To: address, the address is passed through
  build_address () function for possible rewriting/expansion. It is
  done in call_builder () function in pico/composer.c

  The problem was, if the address was not changed, call_builder didn't try
  to compute new fcc. It is opposed to Pine 3.91, where fcc was ALWAYS
  computed unconditionally.

  Because build_address changes route-addr to mbox (<foo@bar.com> ->
  foo@bar.com) the fcc was computed in this case; mbox format was not
  changed at all.

I don't know, why the behavior was changed. If it is only for
optimization, it is a clear bug. Probably, there are some othe reasons - I
don't know.

I attach small patch to pico/composer.c; it just reverts to Pine 3.91
scheme to uncoditionally recompute fcc.

I tried modified Pine and it seems to work so far ;-) The original
behaviour was rather frustrating to me.

greetings

Subject: Problem when compiling Pine 3.92
Message-Id: <Pine.SV4.3.92.960323163140.24367D-100000@itsmx1>
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hi all!

I have seen strange problem when compiling Pine 3.92.

There is a structure "headerentry" defined in pico/pico.h. It is used in
two places; in pine/addrbook.c and pine/send.c. In both cases a static
array of structure headerentry is defined and initialized.

The problem was, two elements were omitted when intializing the structure.
I recall, that some compilers allow it and just silently zap remain with
zeroes; my compiler barks :-(

I include the structure definition and example of intializing:

=============== structure form pico/pico.h ==================

struct headerentry {
        char     *prompt;
	char	 *name;
#if defined(DOS) || defined(HELPFILE)
	short	  help;
#else
	char	**help;
#endif
        int	  prlen;
        int	  maxlen;
        char    **realaddr;
        int     (*builder)();        /* Function to verify/canonicalize val */
	struct headerentry        *affected_entry, *next_affected;
				     /* entry builder's 4th arg affects     */
        char   *(*selector)();       /* Browser for possible values         */
        char     *key_label;         /* Key label for key to call browser   */
        unsigned  display_it:1;	     /* field is to be displayed by default */
        unsigned  break_on_comma:1;  /* Field breaks on commas              */
        unsigned  is_attach:1;       /* Special case field for attachments  */
        unsigned  rich_header:1;     /* Field is part of rich header        */
        unsigned  only_file_chars:1; /* Field is a file name                */
        unsigned  single_space:1;    /* Crush multiple spaces into one      */
        unsigned  sticky:1;          /* Can't change this via affected_entry*/
        unsigned  dirty:1;           /* We've changed this entry            */
	unsigned  start_here:1;	     /* begin composer on first on lit      */
#ifdef	KS_OSDATAVAR
	KS_OSDATAVAR		     /* Port-Specific keymenu data */
#endif
        struct    hdr_line        *hd_text;
};

================== use of it in pine/send.c =====================


/* this is for initializing the fixed header elements in pine_send() */
/*
prompt::name::help::prlen::maxlen::realaddr::
builder::affected_entry::next_affected::selector::key_label::
display_it::break_on_comma::is_attach::rich_header::only_file_chars::
single_space::sticky::hd_text
*/
static struct headerentry he_template[]={
  {"From    : ",  "From",        h_composer_from,       10, 0, NULL,
   build_address, NULL, NULL, addr_book_compose,    "To AddrBk",
   0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, KS_TOADDRBOOK},
  {"Reply-To: ",  "Reply To",    h_composer_reply_to,   10, 0, NULL,
   build_address, NULL, NULL, addr_book_compose,    "To AddrBk",
   0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, KS_TOADDRBOOK},

        ... skipped ...

=========================================================

As you see, two elements (dirty and start_here) are not initializes;
moreover, they are not even mentioned in comments. Also, it looks strange
with KS_OSDATAVAR and hdr_line fields; probably, they also should be
intialized conditionally.

Have anybody also seen it? Probably, I got some wrong distribution - I
picked it up from mirror site in Germany, not form ftp.cac.washington.edu?

thanks in advance

The problem with Tenex is, it is not supported by most MTAs. I checked
your imap-utils, and there is a implementation for Tenex local mailer, but
it replaces COMPLETELY the normal one. The implications are:

  system mbox should be in Tenex format;
  I cannot use any filter such as procmail/ELM filter.

Is there any simple tool available, which just takes message and appends
it to Tenex folder in correct format? Such one, as could be used with
procmail.

Many people are using procmail anyway; it is very simple to pipe message
to additional program; procmail also cares about proper locking, so such
program could be made really very simple.

It would provide for system-wide mbox, while allowing to use Tenex for
personal folders (which for me take up most of the traffic anyway).

thanks in advance

Pine supports MH folders and has done so for some time.

The MH inbox is accessed as #mhinbox.

Other folders are accessed as #mh/foo (for ~/Mail/foo), etc.

Can anyone tell me how to make an email list from my address book without
have to manually place in each name.  Is there a way to set a variable
that holds on the addresses currently in the address book?  Please help.
This is truly becoming a pain in the butt.

If you go to Setup/Config from the main menu, there is a feature
setting...


quell-status-message-beeping


If you set this then you won't get the beep, but the status messages will
still appear...

Is there anyway to kill or block incoming mail from a specific address?
Somehow my address has been caught in an endless loop from the same 
address and I am getting thousands od long letters. I am un able to 
contact the source address of these letters. So can I simply block mail 
from that address somehow?
Thanks

Hi!

I'm looking for some _good_ filters for using PGP in pine 3.92.  At
the moment I use this first attempt, but this isn't optimal:

------------------- pgpencrypt -----------------------------
#!/bin/sh
#
# 21.03.96 Roland Rosenfeld <roland@spinnaker.rhein.de> 
#

pgp -feast $*
------------------- pgpencrypt -----------------------------

------------------- pgpsign --------------------------------
#!/bin/sh
#
# 21.03.96 Roland Rosenfeld <roland@spinnaker.rhein.de> 
#

pgp -fast
------------------- pgpsign --------------------------------

------------------- pgpdecode ------------------------------
#!/bin/sh
#
# 21.03.96 Roland Rosenfeld <roland@spinnaker.rhein.de> 
#

trap "rm -f /tmp/pgpdecode.???.$$; exit" 0 1 2 15

(pgp -f > /tmp/pgpdecode.txt.$$) 2>&1 | tee /tmp/pgpdecode.pgp.$$ 1>&2

sed -e 's/^/| /' /tmp/pgpdecode.pgp.$$

echo -e "\n"
cat /tmp/pgpdecode.txt.$$
------------------- pgpdecode ------------------------------

These scripts are configured in .pinerc as:

------------------- .pinerc --------------------------------
# This variable takes a list of programs that message text is piped into
# after MIME decoding, prior to display.
display-filters="-----BEGIN PGP" /home/roland/bin/pgpdecode

# This defines a program that message text is piped into before MIME
# encoding, prior to sending
sending-filters=/home/roland/bin/pgpsign,
	/home/roland/bin/pgpencrypt _RECIPIENTS_
------------------- .pinerc --------------------------------

Or the same in the setup part of pine.

Any better ideas?

Ciao

        Roland

Well, one way that I have done just this on both UNIX and VMS-based 
operating systems was to use the FTP (File Transfer Protocal) to transfer 
the .addressbook file from the old account to one's new account.  If your 
new or old account does not allow direct Internet access, try downloading 
your .addressbook file from your old account to a floppy disk and uploading 
it to your new account.

> Joe Luttrell

This depends a lot upon the operating system of your new account.  If you 
were on a UNIX system, rename your new .addressbook file to something like 
.addressbook_new, transfer/upload your old .addressbook from your old 
account and cat the two files together as .addressbook 
Or, you could simply invoke the pico editor on addressbook_new, go to 
the very bottom of the file by pressing the ^ (Control) and V keys at the 
same time and when you are at the bottom, press ^R and append 
.addressbook to the end.  Then, press ^O and save the file as 
.addressbook 
Of course, please be very mindful when doing this so as not to wipe 
everything out.  Also, please note that there may be other ways of doing 
what you want depending upon your specifc OS (Operating System) and 
computer experience. :)

    Pine as such has no killfile or message blocking capability (unless
it's in the brand-new version 3.92, which I don't have yet).  You have
to use some program which preprocesses the mail before Pine gets hold
of it.  On Unix systems, possibly the two most commonly used programs
are procmail and filter.  (If you are on Unix and have a Web browser,
you can start from my home page and thread your way into Nancy
McGough's pages on mail filtering.)

Subject: Missing Makefile in 3.92
Date: 20 Mar 1996 23:35:56 GMT
Message-Id: <4iq4os$cq6@pulp.ucs.ualberta.ca>

I have just attempted to *build* an a32 flavor of pine 3.92. The build 
process takes me into the imap/ANSI/c-client directory and then issues a 

make a32

The problem is that there is no makefile. Therefore that target nor any 
other target will be made. This means that pine will not get *made* 
either because of c-client dependencies. 

Doe anyone know where I might get this makefile?

I have same problems on sendmail 8.6.12, kernel 1.2.13, both with the
pre-compiled and myself-compiled version, on both Linuxes I tried. It
cannot send mail, because of unability to access my sent-mail folder, if I
do a "list folders" it just says: 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Folder-collection <mail/[]>  ** Default for Saves **                     (Local)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

             [ ** Empty List **  Select Here to Try Re-Expanding ]

Adding folders is no help. (I vaguely remember pine saying something like
"can't create mail/sent-mail, already exists - can this be a cause? 
Perhaps, but it behaves the same with a new user without mail
subdirectory..) Of course I cannot access my saved-messages, either. It
also behaves weird with two news-collections of mine.. On the other hand,
remote folder collections work well. 

So?

    First, FTP, Telnet, and lynx have nothing to do with Pine. 
Creating a signature file depends on what operating system you are
using, which you did not specify, although your reference to Windows
95 would make me guess PC-Pine.  Unfortunately I am not knowledgeable
on using Pine other than under Unix, so I can't help you there.  As 
for a good book, I am not yet aware of any book dedicated to Pine as
such, because Pine as such is supposed to be relatively easy to use
with its online Help screens.  (Again, some of your questions have
nothing to do with Pine, and how you would use them depends in part on
your operating system.)

 Does anyone know if Pine 3.92 works with the
 Linux 1.2.13 kernel? I couldn't get it to
 compile -had two errors I haven't been
 able to track down. I used the "lnx"
 build and Pico and Pilot compiled
 just fine.

 Anyone?

I'm having some problems getting my folders to work correctly.  
Apparently, I have only my INBOX on the mail server, and all of my 
folders are located in my Unix account space in the mail directory.
Is there a workaround to be able to access these folders?  As it
stands right now, I can only access them if I am using Unix Pine.

Indeed. It's redraws the screen before you can even check if it got a good
signature or not. However, if you exit your (shell/perl) script that does
the display filter with a non-zero value, it will trigger a harmless display
filter error in Pine, that has a nice side effect of not clearing the screen
until you hit <Return> 

Other than that, I've just started with 3.92 (and only installed on one of
our many architectures). Compliment to the Pine developers! I'm still not
completely sure what exactly changed since 3.91, but I like it. Good job!

This is needed when an alias e-mail domain is used.  Thanks!

Your fix is reasonable but re-introduces the bug we were trying to fix
when we changed it a couple weeks ago.  That bug has to do with what pops
up in the fcc line when you enter a list in the To line.  There will be a
more comprehensive and hopefully correct fix in 3.93.

No, the version you got is the same as the one from our site and it is
indeed a bug.  Thanks for noticing it.  It will be fixed in 3.93.  If you
just want to edit to make your compiler happy, initialize those two
variables to zero everywhere (which is what 3.93 will do).  Thanks.

With Pine, you can set up a global addressbook, which users will not be
able to edit.  This is in addition to their personal addressbook.  Pine
doesn't really let you switch between the two, on an either-or basis. 
Instead, it uses the combination of the two.  Regardless of whether an an
address is in the global or personal addressbook, Pine will find it.  If
you want to bring up an addressbook, you *can* however select either to
list.

To use the global addressbook, go into Setup/Config, and find the entry
for global-address-book.  One thing to remember, this list should be a
personal addressbook (so that it can be edited) for the administrator that
is charged with keeping the book up to date.

After adding two filters like the above one I noticed that I could not
see which one I was using because of the missing parameters. So I wrote 
two shell scripts that just call pgp with -fast or -feast. Now I can see
the names of the scripts.

I think it would be better to have entries like this:

"PGP encrypt" /usr/local/bin/pgp -feast
"PGP sign" /usr/local/bin/pgp -fast

Pine could show only the quoted string. This would make it very easy to
distinguish the different filters.

Comments?

	I downloaded the Pine 3.92 source and compiled it on my DU box 
(OSF/1), it seems to work except when sending mail... As soon as I try to 
send mail, it immediately returns an Error, but does not tell me what that 
error is.  Nor is there any indication of an error in the pine-debug files.
I went into the source and noticed that the options passed to sendmail are 
different that the pine 3.91 version we have.  I changed the options to be 
the same as out pine 3.91, but now all it does is hang, with 'Sending %0' on 
the screen.  I then have to manually kill it from another xterm.

	Anyone else seen this problem?

I'd like to select a group of messages for a common action (e.g. Save, Delete
etc) then, once selected, apply the common action. My help screen seems to 
imply that the ";" can be used for Select and A for action. This can't be

Any ideas? Thanks.

Please help me with my Thesis project.

(At the end of this message, there are some questions.) 


I am a post-grad student at Mississippi State University. Last May I 
earned my Master's degree in Technology. This summer I, hopefully, will 
get my Ed.S.

The Technology department at State offers a program that is applicable to
business/industry or education, depending on the electives chosen. 
The program is an overview of the many facets of technology today.

Courses include Networking, Telecommunications (Internet), Lab 
Management, Planing for Technology programs, Multi-Media (incorporating 
Audio, Video, text, graphics, animation, and clipart), Design and 
Evaluation of Software, Emerging Technologies, Repair and Maintenance, 
and software applications Microsoft Works, Compel, HyperCard, PageMaker, 
CorelDraw, and PowerPoint.

*NOTE*: There is no programming in this department and it is not part of, 
nor associated with, the Computer Science Department.


The point of my project is to collect job information about positions in 
the public or private sector that are available to persons with this 
education.

These job titles do not have to be positions that are currently vacant. 
The idea here is to create a database of the kinds of jobs that are out 
there.

If you are interested, you may check out my homepage which is dedicated 
to this project. There are links to my Resume, the computer applications 
that I use, my personal computer-related library, and an overview of the 
course descriptions. 

http://www2.msstate.edu/~esp1/index.html

or (for all the homepages at Mississippi State University, mine included)

http://www.msstate.edu/local_users.html   (no "2")



All questions below are optional; but I would appreciate as much 
information as you will share with me.

     just double-click on the file icon and it automatically expands

Hi fellow 'netters,

My name is Lucy Whitten and I recently started using a magazine
subscription club in the USA that has a FREE 1 yr. magazine subscription
deal with your first paid order- and I have been very pleased with them.
They have over 1,500 different USA titles that they can ship to any country
on a subscription basis.   As for computer magazines from the USA, they
more of a selection than I ever knew even existed.  They have magazines for
most every area of interest in their list of 1,500 titles.

Within the USA, for their USA members, they are cheaper than all their
competitors and even the publishers themselves.  This is their price
guarantee.

Overseas, on the average, they are generally around one-fourth to one-half
of what the newsstands overseas charge locally for USA magazines.  On some
titles they are as little as one-tenth of what the newsstands charge.  They
feel that mgazines should not be a luxury overseas.   In the USA, people
buy magazines and then toss them after reading them for just a few minutes
or hours.  They are so cheap in the USA!   Well, this company would like to
make it the same way for their overseas members.  They are also cheaper
than all their competitors in the USA and overseas, including the
publishers themselves!   This is their price guarantee.  Around one-half
their business comes from overseas, so they are very patient with new
members who only speak limited English as a 2nd language.

Their prices are so cheap because they deal direct with each publisher and
cut-out all the middlemen.

They will send you their DELUXE EMAIL CATALOGUE (around 525K-big and
juicey) !)...if you completely fill out the form above.  It has lists of
all the freebies, lists of all the titles they sell, titles broken down by
categories and detailed descriptions on nearly 1,200 of the titles that
they sell.

Please do not email me as I am just a happy customer and a *busy* student.
I don't have time to even complete my thesis in time, let alone run my
part-time software business!  Please fill out the above form and carefully
follow the intructions above to get it to them via fax or smail.

They guarantee to beat all their competitors' prices. Sometimes they are
less than half of the next best deal I have been able to find and other
times, just a little cheaper - but I have never found a lower rate yet.
They assured me that if I ever do, they will beat it.

They have been very helpful and helped me with all my address changes as I
haved moved from one country to another.

They have a deal where you can get a free 1 yr. sub to a new magazine from
a special list of over 295 popular titles published in the USA.   They will
give you this free 1 yr. sub when you place your first paid order with them
to a renewal or new subscription to any of the over 1,500 different popular
USA titles they sell.

They can arrange delivery to virtually any country and I think they have
clients in around 45 or 46 countries now.  Outside the USA there is a
charge for FPH (foreign postage and handling) (on both paid and freebie
subs) that varies from magazine to magazine.  I have found their staff to
be very friendly and courteous.  They even helped me with an address change
when I moved from one country to another.

The owner thinks of his service as a "club" and his clients as "members"
(even though there is no extra fee to become a member - your first purchase
automatically makes you a member) and he is real picky about who he accepts
as a new member.   When he sets you up as a new member, he himself calls
you personally on the phone to explain how he works his deal, or sometimes
he has one of his assistants call.  He is kind of quirky sometimes - he
insists on setting up new members by phone so he can say hi to everyone (I
sure wouldn't want to have his phone bills!),  but you can place future
orders (after your first order) via E-mail.

He has some really friendly young ladies working for him, who seem to know
just as much as he does about this magazine stuff.  If you live overseas,
he will even call you there, as long as you are interested, but I think he
still makes all his overseas calls on the weekends, I guess cause the long
distance rates are cheaper then.

He only likes to take new members from referrals from satisfied existing
members and he does virtually no advertising.  When I got set-up, they had
a 2-3 week waiting list for new members to be called back so that they
could join up. (Once you are an existing member, they help you immediately
when you call. )  I think they are able to get back to prospective new
members  the same day or within a few days now, as they have increased
their staff.  I am not sure about this.........but if you email the above
form to them, that is the way to get started!

They will send you their DELUXE EMAIL CATALOGUE (around 525K-big and
juicey) !)...if you completely fill out the form above.  It has lists of
all the freebies, lists of all the titles they sell, titles broken down by
categories and detailed descriptions on nearly 1,200 of the titles that
they sell.

They then send you email  that outlines how his club works and the list of
free choices that you can choose from, as well as the entire list of what
he sells;  and then they will give you a quick (3-5 minute) friendly,
no-pressure no-obligation call to explain everything to you personally and
answer all your questions.

Once you get in, you'll love them. I do.


Sincerely,

Lucy Whitten


ps.  please forward a copy of this message to all your friends on the net
who you think might be interested in it!  It is a great deal!  If you join
and then they join after you, you will earn a free 1 yr. subscription for
each new person you get to join after you join!   If you exceed 25
referrals, they let you use them to give away as gifts, for Christmas,
Chanukah or any other occasion.  Please be kind enough to mention my name
when you join.   I will then get a free magazine for a year for referring
you.
Thank you.

I'd suggest the following solution for pgpdecode. Everything
will be written to /tmp, so this script is suitable for everyone
on a multiuser system and to secure the temp-files in /tmp, 
the umask will be set, so that the permissions are secure
(rw-------).

Yes!  I have seen this exact same problem on on two different 
different Linux boxes (one running sendmail-8.7.3, and the other
running sendmail-8.7.5).

On both computers, if I switch to sendmail-8.6.13, the "Error"
is no longer returned when I try to send mail using Pine, and 
the mail is sent okay.

On both computers, Pine 3.91 worked fine with sendmail-8.7.x.

Finally, as an interim solution, if I create a global pine
configuration file (/usr/local/lib/pine.conf) and edit the
line "smtp-server=" to read as "smtp-server=localhost", Pine 3.92
sends mail okay even with sendmail-8.7.x.

I would be interested in learning if you can duplicate any of
the observations I have made on OSF/1, and if the workaround
mentioned above works.

Cheers,
Ashok

Same noted here with Linux/sendmail-8.7.5.

Or add to pine/osdep/os-lnx.h.....

#define DF_SENDMAIL_PATH   "/usr/sbin/sendmail -oi -oem -t"

... to return to 3.91 behaviour.

I'm having a strange problem with Pine 3.92 for AIX that I can't quite 
figure out.  It works great for all users except root.  Under the root 
id, it says that it can't write the configuration to /.pinerc because the 
file doesn't exist.  But it does!  I've checked the permissions, owner, 
group, etc... and everything looks fine.  Any one else have this problem?

I am afraid that I don't know what's causing your problems, but Pine 3.92
(self-compiled on this 1.2.13 machine) works fine with my sendmail 8.7.5.
Have you checked the permissions of the relevant files and directories? Or
tried increasing the debugging level of sendmail?

Good luck,

Hi Wanda,
I have Windows 95 too. I print email from home all the time. What specific
questions do you have. Since I'm at the UW (where PINE was born) I have
access to lots of help desk folks, so ask away one at a time, OK? J.

What do you see at the top of the screen where you are trying the ";"?
I see "FOLDER INDEX" and the ";" & "A" commands work fine for me. I just
now tried it in inbox index and a usenet index folder. Jon

Just a quick question that I lookeed up at washington.edu, but I just 
wanted to clarify it to make sure I got it right.

Unix Pine has message folders that save all the messages together into one 
file.  Now, does PC pine do the same thing so that I could simply copy 
those files onto my PC and Pine would understand them the equally?

Hi.  Recently I ran, for the first time, the Netscape 2.0 Mail program.  Since then, my Pine
Inbox would update with new messages.  Netscape created a directory, "nsmail", in which it
stores the Netscape inbox, called "Inbox".  It also has the file "..PINE", which is the PINE
Inbox the last time it was updated.   Anyway, I changed the inbox path in PINE to nsmail/Inbox;
but now, in PINE, new messages only appear once I've already opened them in Netscape, not
otherwise.  What can I do to restore the INBOX in PINE??

I'm using a Sun SparcStation and PINE 3.90.  Thanks in advance.

Use the UNIX Finger utility with the -l option and your target's e-mail 
address as an argument as follows:

finger -l <e-mail address>  

Finger gives you information as to whether or not your target is logged 
in, when he was last logged in, when he last read his mail and when he 
received the last e-mail, if any, and some other information as well.

Note that if your target's system administrator has disabled the finger
utility, you will not be able to determine if your target has received
your message or not.

You could add your own emailaddress to sending-filters, this way you can
read the copy in the sent-mail folder.

Subject: Problem with Pico editor
Date: 25 Mar 1996 09:21:06 GMT
Message-Id: <4j5oi2$pob@newnews.iafrica.com>

Hi All

I have recently downloaded and compiled the pico editor.  It is just
what I was looking for - nice and easy for new users.

I have two issues I would like some help on.

1.  The help tells me that Ctrl-^ is used to select text.  I cannot
    seem to get this right

2.  How does one overtype characters (ie. vi's replace mode).

Thanks
Deon

There's a program which can be downloaded from

http://www.interguru.com

that is supposed to do this conversion, have not tried it muself (I
have no need for such a conversion).

The Select (;), Apply (A) and Zoom (Z) command are not available by
default; you must enable them before you can use them.

Go to the Setup Configuration screen (S then C from the Main Menu) and
check the "enable-aggregate-command-set" feature.

Has anyone managed to get the new filter options to work in Pine 3.92
yet?  I can't seem to get either the display or the sending filter to
do anything.  I guess it's just my failure to understand the syntax
required in .pinerc to set them up, but if someone could post an example
I'd really appreciate it.

TIA,

Alan

Maybe the character is caught by your Terminals(server). You could type 
<ESC> <ESC> <^> instead of <ctrl-^>. (Works with any control character in 
pico)

: 2.  How does one overtype characters (ie. vi's replace mode).

Don't know, I believe you can't.

Using $HOME/tmp would be probably safer, and more logical. This is the

Well i have this problem with the userdb database.

I have some declarations as this one

lfasano:mailname	Luis_Fasano@campus.mty.itesm.mx

my problem is that whenever i send a mail using the mail command or with elm, the replacement is done, but when i send a mail using pine it is not.

IS there anyway to modificate the rule or database to make these change even if sending through pine???
Is there any definition in pinerc which may help with this???

I've read the manuals and havent found anything about it. 

Any pointer????

Thanks in advance


Luis


pd.  BTW Im doing the database using the makemap btree command...

Message-Id: <4j19iq$ph4@shellx.best.com>


I am transferring my Internet account from one service provider (Netcom) 
to another (Best). Is there a way to save and transfer over my long and 
carefully constructed address book at Netcom, so I don't have to start 
all over at Best?

Also, I have begun a new address book at Best. Is there anyway to append 
the Netcom address book to it, rather than subbing in the Netcom for the 
Best? I would rather not lose the new one at Best if I don't have to.

Many thanks,

Joe Luttrell

When in the middle of responding to a message, I am unable to get the ^C
option to work with the 3.92a version of PINE.  Therefore, I am unable to
"get out of" a message to which I have decided not to respond.

This option worked previously.

: I think it would be better to have entries like this:

: "PGP encrypt" /usr/local/bin/pgp -feast
: "PGP sign" /usr/local/bin/pgp -fast

: Pine could show only the quoted string. This would make it very easy to

: Comments?

I totaly agree. I think, writing scripts to distingish the filter-action 
is a workaround, not a solution.

	Gee, I thought I had posted on this one already. Simply put a
".forward" account in your home directory with the new e-mail address
in it. Don't forget the "." in front of the name of the file.

Pine 3.92 does not seem to be able to handle 8 bit characters in the
attachment comment. When the comment includes 8 bit chars (for
instance greek chars of the ISO-8859-7 char set) they arrive
destroyed (I think they arrive with their eighth bit stripped)
at the other end no matter if 8 bit or MIME encoding has been
requested from the configuration menu.

1.   Introduction

Last Tuesday, new versions of Pine (3.92) and Pico (2.6) were released by
the Pine Development Team at the University of Washington.  Since it has
been 17 months since the Pine Development Team have released a new version
of Pine, numerous changes have appeared.  However, there are few changes
that affect the "novice user".  Most of the changes are additional
bells-and-whistles for so-called "power users".

Full details of these changes are given in Pine 3.92's Release Notes
(which are available by pressing R from the main menu of Pine 3.92).
You can also get a lot of useful information by pressing the ? key whilst
browsing through Pine's Configuration Screen.

The remainder of this message contains part of a document that I originally
prepared for internal consumption at the University of Durham.  I have sent
it to this mailing list just in case it is of interest to others.
It essentially contains my personal view of the most useful changes, and
how they may be used.  The message is subdivided as follows:
      2.   Controlling the way in which Pine displays information
      3.   Additional facilities whilst composing messages
      4.   Improvements in printing messages
      5.   Changes to Usenet News
      6.   Additional facilities for aggregate commands
      7.   Facilities that can be used in the X Window System
      8.   Some other new facilities
I hope that it does not contain any errors.  Let me know if you find
some.


2.   Controlling the way in which Pine displays information

2.1  Displaying MIME attachments

Given an attachment containing some file, Pine uses mime-types files to
map from the file's extension to a content-type and mailcap files to map
from the content-type to a viewer.  You can therefore use these two
facilities to start a viewer (e.g., xv) automatically if the attachment
has a certain file extension (e.g., jpeg).  Pine has standard locations
for the mime-types and mailcap files: for example, any user can use
configure their own viewers using the files ~/.mime.types and ~/.mailcap.

2.2  Displaying information in an addressbook

In Pine 3.92, you can control the layout of the addressbook by the
changing the value of the addressbook-formats variable.  Its default
setting is:
   NICKNAME FULLNAME ADDRESS
An addressbook also has a COMMENT and an FCC field.  If you add
additional information in the COMMENT field of each addressbook entry,
then you could get this information displayed by setting this variable to:
   NICKNAME FULLNAME(25) ADDRESS COMMENT

2.3  Displaying the index of a folder

In Pine 3.92, you can control the layout of the index of a folder by the
changing the value of the index-format variable.  Its default setting is:
   STATUS MSGNO DATE FROMORTO(33%) SIZE SUBJECT(67%)


3.   Additional facilities whilst composing messages

3.1  Controlling the column at which Pine's composer wraps lines

In Pine 3.92, you can set the column at which Pine's composer wraps long
lines.  This is done by setting the composer-wrap-column variable.

3.2  Giving ^K the same meaning as in emacs (and elsewhere)

In Pine 3.91, pressing ^K means delete the contents of the current line
(unless a "mark" has been set).  In 3.92, you can configure Pine to delete
from the cursor position to the end of the current line (as is done in
emacs and elsewhere).  You do this by adding:
   compose-cut-from-cursor
to the feature-list variable.  The emacs-effect only seems to work in the
body of the message: it has its old effect in the headers of a message and
when using the new version of Pico (Pico 2.6) in stand-alone mode.

3.3  Composing a message with 8-bit characters

In Pine 3.92, when composing a message you can type in an 8-bit character
by typing the 5 characters ESC ESC d d d, where ESC is the escape key and
the "d d d" are three decimal digits for the character.  For example, if
the resulting message is viewed on an ISO-8859-1 device, then the meaning
of the three decimal digit values 231 to 235 are c-cedilla, e-grave,
e-acute, e-circumflex and e-umlaut.  This facility is also available in
the new version of Pico (Pico 2.6).

3.4  Editing your .signature file from within Pine

In Pine 3.92, you can edit the file containing your signature by pressing
S followed by S from the main menu.


4.   Improvements in printing messages

4.1  Setting up your own print commands

In Pine, the Select Printer screen is obtained by pressing S followed by P
from the main menu.  In 3.91, there were three printing methods:
attached-to-ansi, the standard Unix print command (lp) or a personal print
command.  And you used either 1, 2 or 3 to select the default printing
method.  With 3.92, there is an attached-to-ansi-no-formfeed as well as
attached-to-ansi, and you can add as many personal printing commands as
you wish.

If you want to add a new personal printing method, move the cursor so that
"Personally selected print command" is highlighted and then press A.
Pine then asks you for the printer name.  This need not be a "printer name":
it is really a name to identify this printing method.  So, it can be any
name: it can indeed be the name of a printer, some nickname for the
printing method (e.g., "twoup" or "upstairs"), or it can be left empty.
Terminate the "printer name" with the Enter key.  It will then ask you to
enter the command to be used for this printing method (followed by Enter).
This may be any Unix command or the special commands attached-to-ansi or
attached-to-ansi-no-formfeed.  You can repeat this A command as often as
you wish, and in this way you build up a list of personal printing
methods.

In order to select the default printing method, you don't use 1, 2 or 3 as
in Pine 3.91: instead you use the cursor-moving keys to highlight the
method and then press the S key.

If your default is one of the personal printing methods, then when you issue
the Y command (to print), it will ask you whether you want to print using
this method.  However, in the menu at the bottom of the screen, as well as
"Y Yes" and "N No" you will also see ^P and ^N.  If you decline by
pressing ^P or ^N instead of Y, it will display the previous/next printing
method in your list of personal printing methods, and you will now be given
an opportunity to print using this printing method.  Normally, it will
prompt you with the "printer name":  however, if, when configuring your
list of personal printing methods, you entered an empty "printer name",
then it will prompt you with the actual Unix command that will be used.
For this reason, you may find it helpful to have empty "printer names".

4.2  Choosing the Unix command line when you come to print

In Pine 3.92, you can add:
   print-offers-custom-cmd-prompt
to the feature-list variable, and when you issue the Y command (to print)
the menu at the bottom of the screen will have an additional choice
"C CustomPrint" besides "Y Yes" and "N No".  If you press C, you can type
in any Unix command (to print the message).


5.   Changes to Usenet News

5.1  Replying to an article of a newsgroup

In Pine 3.92, using R to reply to an article of a newsgroup asks you to
press F to follow-up to the newsgroup, R to reply to the author of the
article, or B to do both.  This is clearer than the method used in
Pine 3.91.

5.2  Finding out which articles are new

If you would like Pine 3.92 to mark more-or-less recent new articles of a
Usenet News newsgroups, then add:
   news-approximates-new-status
to the feature-list variable.  Note that this is an approximation, and not
an exact record of which messages you have not seen.


6.   Additional facilities for aggregate commands

6.1  A short-cut for tagging the current message and moving to the next

In Pine 3.91, when in the index of a folder, a ; followed by C followed by
cursor-down done repeatedly will "tag" consecutive messages.  In 3.92,
this three character sequence can be done by just pressing the : key.
Note: both ; and : are illegal unless you have added
enable-aggregate-command-set to the feature-list variable.

6.2  Printing messages that have been tagged

In Pine 3.91, after using the ; command to tag some messages, you can use
the apply command to do a command to each of the tagged messages.  One of
the possibilities is to print the set of messages.  If you do this, the
messages will be printed without any formfeed between the messages.
In 3.92, if you want a formfeed between messages, then add:
   print-formfeed-between-messages
to the feature-list variable.


7.   Facilities that can be used in the X Window System

7.1  Using the mouse to select

In Pine 3.92, you can add:
   enable-mouse-in-xterm
to the feature-list variable.  You will then be able to use the mouse for
some purposes if you are using Pine in an xterm window (but not in CDE's
dtterm window).  In particular, when you have a folder-index displayed
you can select a message using the mouse, and when composing a message you
can use the mouse to say where on the screen you want to type.

7.2  Finding out what new mail has arrived

In Pine 3.92, you can add:
   enable-newmail-in-xterm-icon
to the feature-list variable and, if you iconise an xterm window
containing a Pine session, then the icon will be altered if new mail
arrives.


8.   Some other new facilities

8.1  Finding out what commands you have executed

In Pine 3.92, the main menu has a J command (meaning "journal")  that
enables you to see what commands you have executed.  This may prove useful
when trying to solve a user's problem.

8.2  Controlling where Pine saves messages

In Pine 3.92, there is a saved-msg-name-rule that determines the default
folder name for Pine's S ("save") command.  You can choose between
default-folder, last-folder-used, by-from, by-sender, by-recipient,
by-nick-of-from, by-nick-of-sender, by-nick-of-recip, by-fcc-of-from,
by-fcc-of-sender, or by-fcc-of-recip.  The default is default-folder which
means using the saved-messages folder.  By-from falls back to by-sender if
there is no from, and vice versa for by-sender.  By-recipient will use the
newsgroup name if it was posted to a newsgroup.  The by-nick... forms are
like the same forms without the by-nick except that the resulting address
is looked up in the user's address books and if it is found, the nickname
for that entry is used.  The by-fcc... forms act in a similar way except
that the fcc from the address books is used instead.

8.3  Using PGP with Pine

In Pine 3.92, in order to add a digital signature to outgoing messages,
you can set sending-filters to be:
   /usr/local/bin/pgp -fats

You can also add:
   compose-send-offers-first-filter
to the feature-list variable if you wish.

In order to run pgp on messages that you are viewing (i.e., other people's
messages), you can set display-filters variable to be:
   _LEADING("-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----")_ /usr/local/bin/pgp

Although I am happy with the outgoing bit, I would like more control over
the display-filters: (a) it's difficult to see what pgp is telling me ---
it leaves the screen too quickly, (b) it would be nice to be able to
toggle display-filtering on and off.  Having said that, these hooks in
3.92 that enable digital signatures to be done a lot easier are very
useful.

8.4  Determining whether a message has been sent by you

Pine 3.92 has an alt-addresses variable.  This variable can be set to
other e-mail addresses which identify the current user in addition to
something like dxy3abc@altair.dur.ac.uk.  At Durham, this will be
something like A.B.Customer@durham.ac.uk and A.B.Customer@dur.ac.uk.
- From Pine 3.05 to Pine 3.91, we made local modifications to the source of
Pine that involved the use of a file called ~/.pinerc_extra to store
these additional e-mail addresses.  So, in Pine 3.92, all this code can be
removed and the alt-addresses variable used instead.  So Durham's startup
script for Pine now sets up an environment variable that is used by Pine's
pine.conf file to set up the alt-addresses variable.

---559023410-1141662977-827774618=:23667
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

I do not think that pine 3.92 handles properly messages with 8 bit chars
which are supposed to be part of a specific char set such as ISO-8859-7
(greek chars) which I used for my experiments.

The point is that when we choose to set on or off the two configuration
options

[ ]  enable-8bit-esmtp-negotiation
[ ]  enable-8bit-nntp-posting

from the setup menu the encodings do not follow the encodings implied by
the above settings in all the configurations. To tell such cases more
precisely I have dome experiments where:

1. I have tried to post a news article with greek chars both on the
subject and in the body. When an nntp server is not specified then
pine uses the "inews" utility which knows where to post the article.
In this case, no matter what was the setting of enable-8bit-nntp-posting
the message arrived encoded in MIME on the host which collects the
news postings for our LAN. Certainly that was not a problem of the
local configuration because I used inews manually and it DID post
an 8bit article to the server by keeping the 8 bits both in the body
and in the subject.

2. As a follow-up of the previous experiment I set the nntp-server
from the configuration menu and I repeated the same procedure. In
that case the message encoding was following the

[ ]  enable-8bit-nntp-posting

value but only for the body and not for the Subject which arrived
MIME encoded all the time.

3. Also when there is no smtp-server (which keeps the name of the
mail relay) defined then the mail arrives always MIME encoded
no matter whether

[ ]  enable-8bit-esmtp-negotiation

is set or not.

Definitely it is not because of the flags the sendmail is called
by pine with.

My personal view is that when we ask for an 8 bit transmission the
message should arrive at the final host in 8 bits no matter if a
mail relay intervenes in the journey or not. I had a look in the
code and I realised that indeed the F_ENABLE_8BIT flag is not
checked for all cases of transmission.



As an attempt to prove to myself that the problem was inside pine I
made some modifications to the code (only in file send.c) which
I am including as an attachment to this mail. And this seemms to
work fine for all the above cases that I have talked about before.
I am not issuing this as an official patch - I just send it to you
as a possible help for the points where further encoding or encoding
prevention is necessary.

I hope I have not misunderstood something for all the above behaviour.

Thank you,

Is it possible to take the addresses in the CC field (when receiving a 
message) and create a distribution list from it?
(I've only been able to export the message and then import the header 
into  the .addressbook and make some small layout changes, I was hoping 
there was an easier way)

Please reply to me as I dont check the list too often,

Thank you.

Neal

I don't know whether this will also solve your problem, but I got another
reply which says:

From: Ashok Aiyar <aiyar@ebv.oncology.wisc.edu>
Subject: Re: Pine 3.92 and Linux problems

You don't happen to be running a modified version of sendmail as well?

I don't have Pine 3.92 for Win95, but in Unix Pine 3.91 to turn on 
highlighting of selected headers, go into Setup, choose Config, and check 
the feature "show-selected-in-boldface."

But I will defer to a more knowledgeable person.

Hi,
does anyone have a solution for using the imap-system along with a shadowed

When trying to delete and expunge messages from pine/windows the

disconnects.

The pinedebug file says "Pine 25F7 did not call "WSACleanup."

Can anyone help?  Many thanks in advance.

The most recently released version (3.92) has an excellent set of hooks
for PGP support I have adapted the following series of scripts to do
the job.  They were posted here a couple of days ago (the original
author's name and address is in the scripts).  They make it very, very
painless to use PGP:

sed -e 's/^/| /' /home/dean/.tmp/pgpdecode.pgp.$$
echo " "
cat /home/dean/.tmp/pgpdecode.txt.$$


---------- pgpencrypt ---------

# 21.03.96 Roland Rosenfeld <roland@spinnaker.rhein.de> 
pgp -feast $*


---------- pgpsign ---------
#!/bin/sh
# 21.03.96 Roland Rosenfeld <roland@spinnaker.rhein.de> 
pgp -fast


---------- .pinerc ---------

# e.g. feature-list= select-without-confirm, signature-at-bottom
# Default condition for all of the features is no-.
feature-list=compose-send-offers-first-filter

# This variable takes a list of programs that message text is piped into

Date: 25 Mar 1996 20:20:25 GMT
Message-Id: <4j6v69$gen@azure.acsu.buffalo.edu>

At long last, pine has authentication support, which means that it may not
be used as a newsreader at our site.  Unfortunately, I can't seem to get it
to function.  From what I can tell by browsing the code, if pine
notices a 480 response from the server, it should prompt me for a username
and password to use to authenticate myself.  This doesn't seem to happen,
and I get the "480 Authentication required" message on the screen.  I
wasn't able to find any documentation on how to get this to work.  Does
anyone have any suggestions?
Thanks,
  -Matt

pine392.zip has been uploaded to hobbes.nmsu.edu:/incoming.

This is a port of the UNIX Pine mailer to OS/2 2.x and Warp
3.x. Included are many fixes for the previous binary release
for OS/2 (3.91) and a large number of enhancements and
additions.

To those who helped test the beta version and submitted
reports, thank you for your time and trouble.

Yes, this is a bug.  I've attached a context diff for those who'd like to
fix it in the source, and, of course, it will be fixed in 3.93.  The
bug doesn't happen on all systems, so if you haven't seen it, don't
worry about fixing it.  Thanks for bringing it to our attention.

No, it's not modified in any way.
I'd guess at a problem with pine and the beta libc I'm using resulting in
the premature EOF ?
It needs someone proficient in 'C' to debug it and unfortunately I'm not
that person. ;-)

I had no problems compiling pine 3.92 under Linux 1.2.13 with gcc
2.7.0 and libc 5.0.9.

I changed pico/makefile.lnx, pine/makefile.lnx and
imap/ANSI/c-client/Makefile to use -O2 instead of -g.

Problem -- Pine 3.92 aborts when attempting to edit a partially completed
entry in your addressbook.

Entered Pine from command    pine392 -i

Hit M for Main Menu  then A for AddressBook   then W to get to my line

The line I go to is a PARTIAL address listing - previously I had entered
the "Nickname" - but under the "Fullname" and "Address" I had entered
nothing, and saved off.

None the less, the line is now highlighted, but with ONLY a NickName
showing.  When I hit the "V" for View/Edit this line what I get
(everytime) is AN ABORT saying:

Problem detected: "Received Abort Signal"
Pine Exiting
Pine392: 15842 Floating Exception (Core Dump)

System returns me to the ULTRIX level.  Core dump is present in my home
directory.

THE BUG:  Either it shouldn't allow me to save off without all the lines
filled in on the address book line  OR  it should be able to allow me to
come back in and EDIT those empty lines with the rest of the new data.
So, not sure which module is at fault, but because it's letting me do
something unexpected, I do get an ABORT each and every time.

Thanks in advance.

I'm looking forward to using the new Pine - thanks for providing a
great tool for all of the Internet!  When I ask my sys admins to
install it, do I need to ask them to uncomment this line:

 #define ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM

Or has this feature changed in any way, e.g., default is to allow
changing from or the line above has changed in some way?  What is
the name of the file it's in?

Thanks much,
Nancy

I am trying to decide which command line mailer to use on my linux system.  
The problem is that the machine is not turned on most of the time, so I 
want a "reply-to" address that is a machine that is turned on most of the 
time.

I cannot find this simple header in my .pinerc or in the options setup.  Is 
there a way to set it up?  (Please respond to me by email, too.  Our news 
server is rather flaky and articles are very short-lived.)

Regards,

Go into the Setup Configuration screen (S then C from the Main Menu).

Look down the list of options for "customized-headers".

Add the additional header(s) you wish to set up, including any default
value.  For example:

	Reply-to: Ivo Welch <ivo.welch@anderson.ucla.edu>

Cheers,

Pine is currently the recommended mailer at the University of Durham.

not to set.  We do this by having a /usr/local/lib/pine.conf.fixed file

     Hi,
     
     I am trying to obtain Pine for a Unisys system. Looking through 
     Washington Universities ftp site I see that pine runs on a bunch of 
     Unix systems, but their is no port to Unisys.
     
     Although the source code is available we do not have the technical 
     experience and hardware to be able to port it to Unisys. Has anyone 
     out there carried out the changes to the code or is able to make the 
     changes, and if so who do I speak to ?
     
     thanks in advance,

	Using pine3.92 (or 3.91) right?

	In the options add the "Reply-To: " in the "Customized Headers"
option.

This sounds like a sendmail problem to me (possibly an error in the
Mlocal definition in sendmail.cf).  Do you get the same behavior using
the Unix mail (or Mail) program?

it does, but the return address it gives (I had corrections to make)
goes to a program which mails you the FAQ again (it's not tiny) and
then discards your mail.

I've recommended they change that.

Is it possible for Pine to stop cross-posted newsgroup articles appearing
in the lists for all the newsgroups its been cross-posted to? ie. if
you've read the article in one newsgroup, you don't see it appearing in
all the others.

I've been told by someone who doesn't use Pine that most newsreaders
should be able to deduce either from the message-id or Xref: line whether
its seen an article before.

Can Pine do this? If so, how can the feature be enabled?

	Automatically? I don't know. They can find out if they are 
technically adept at using sendmail by telneting to the correct port and 
expanding the address (I believe).

	You can create it in PICO, and the only line is your new address. 
Just make sure the file is named properly and test it before relying on it.

	People sort of think this is magic, but it really a *very* old 
Unix trick.

The following applies to sendmail 8.7.x - I didn't check 8.6.x for it.

sendmail rewrites the From: header using UDB *only* if envelope sender as
determined by sendmail is the same, as header sender.

In case of local mail, the envelope sender from sendmail point of view is
always just user, without domain qualification. It means, that header
sender *must* be just plain user for UDB rewriting to take place.

Basically there are several possibilities:

1. modify Pine to put just plain user in From: header. It seems to be not
impossible but must be done carefully.

2. modify sendmail to uconditionally use UDB for header rewriting. There
is already code for it, but it is under #ifdef MAYBENEXTRELEASE. You could
try to remove #ifdef and look, if it works. In this case you will have to
put user@FQDN in UDB in addition to plain user.

3. modify sendmail.cf: resolve all local mail to user@FQDN, and strip
FQDN in local mailer rules. It seems to be possible, and should work; but
I never did try it. You will need user@FQDN in this case also. Also
in this case you lose UDB for elm :-(

It seems to be basically sendmail problem (for me). Probably, sometimes
#ifdef MAYBENEXTRELEASE will be removed in oficial distribution of
sendmail.

hope it helps

I am using Mail now but I want to start using Pine. My question is:

How do I transfer my old folders I established when I use Mail to 
Pine?

Thank you for your help.

Nancy,
This has not changed... so yes, you'll need to uncomment and recompile.

It's a problem with creating the name for the temporary file which is
used to for the new .pinerc before changing the name. The problem is in
_gettemp (pine/osdep/tempnam) and after a build placed in pine/os.c.

Pine generates a temporary file name like "/home/user/pinercXXXXXX"
there the X's gets replaced by the process ID.  In the code part below
"as" is the temporary name under construction and "trv" is a pointer in
that string placed just before the X which at this point is replaced
with PID. This code is part of a check to see if the directory is
writable.  This routine stats "/home/user" in the example above which
is ok, but if you are root (have / as home directory), the temporary
file will be "/pinercXXXXXX", which gives a stat on "", which is not
ok

        /*
         * check for write permission on target directory; if you have
         * six X's and you can't write the directory, this will run for
         * a *very* long time.
         */
        for (start = ++trv; trv > as && *trv != '/'; --trv);
        if (*trv == '/') {
                *trv = '\0';
                if (stat(as, &sbuf) || !(sbuf.st_mode & S_IFDIR))
                        return(0);
                *trv = '/';
        }
 
I have not tested this carefully but I think it will solve the
problem:

*** tempnam.orig        Sun Mar 24 12:41:03 1996
--- tempnam     Sun Mar 24 12:43:13 1996

         */
        for (start = ++trv; trv > as && *trv != '/'; --trv);
        if (*trv == '/') {
+                 if (as == trv)
+                         trv++;
                *trv = '\0';
                if (stat(as, &sbuf) || !(sbuf.st_mode & S_IFDIR))
                        return(0);

Hello!

Using Pine 3.92 on Dec Unix, I get the following message every time that
reply to a message:

                [Can't create .addressbook.lu, using temp file]

The file does not exist, it does not ahve any odd rights etc.  The .lu
file was fine when I used 3.91, and then after the upgrade I started to
get this.

Thoughts ?

Thanks!

Michael

If I remember right, I changed two files.

imap/ANSI/c-client/LDFLAGS:
-lshadow

imap/ANSI/c-client/os_lnx.h add the following line:
#define crypt pw_encrypt

Hi All,
Can anyone explain me how can I put a ReplyTo header to
Pine?
I was not able to find out how to do it. I checked .pinerc
but I did not find any reference to it.
thanks

Yup, that's the error message you get when the server doesn't have
IMAP configured.  You will need to convince your system administrator
to configure IMAP to run PC-Pine...

Subject: Bug? OS/2 Pine 3.92
Message-Id: <1996Mar25.202327.7809@venus.gov.bc.ca>
Date: 25 Mar 96 20:23:22 PST

I just tried Pine 3.92 for OS/2 and I have a problem.  I run Pine, it
attempts to open my inbox and prompts for username and password.  I
enter it.  It opens my inbox.

I then press "L" (folder List) and it prompts for username and
password.  I pick a folder, it asks for username and password, etc.

This was not happening with Pine 3.91 (pine391a.zip).  3.91 asks once
and I can cruise through all files.

Is there a solution?

    This will probably become a Frequently Asked Question.

To keep from having to enter your login, specify your username in every
folder collection.  That is,
{themis.ag.gov.bc.ca}    will become...
{themis.ag.gov.bc.ca/user=bm71569}

After you do this, you will no longer need to enter your login for each
folder you access.

Note that this specification is incompatible with 3.91.  The point behind
this is to allow you to access different folders as different logins on
the same host, which was previously impossible.  So, if you were to share
folders with someone (as we have a common mailbox for radio mail here),
every user would be able to view the messages in these folders as
themselves, as well as seeing their own mail.

(Maybe 3.93 will have an option to let you specify that the same login is
to be used with the same hostname at all times?  Just a thought...)

In the address book use "S - CreateList" and "Z - AddToList".  There may
be some limits to the number of names that can be contained in a list.

On a unix computer there is also a system wide alias file "/etc/aliases"
that can contain aliases for individuals and groups.

I have both a local news spool for about 20 newsgroups,
and an nntp server to read the rest of full feed that our ISP
carries. we see one can enter path to .newsrc, but since we have 2 different
spools (the remote nntp one and local /usr/spool/news one, we need 2 
different .newsrc's, (to keep the article numbwers for each spool correct 
in the .newsrc. we do this with tin/rtin by using a -f option and 
addressing an alternet .newsrc when using local spool. how do we do this 
with pine 3.92's new options?

Hi, Q&A:
Date:
3/96
Question:  Why doesn't the "attached-to-ansi" printing work with my
communication software. (Hyperterminal)

Answer:  The only supported software communication packages that
include the "attached-to-ansi" function are Kermit, EWAN Telnet and NCSA
Telnet.

Kermit is located on ftp.cac.washington.edu:

Directory for the Mac version:  /world/kermit/mac
Directory for the DOS version:  /world/kermit/msdos

The UW Dial IP program is located on ftp.cac.washington.edu;

Directory for Windows:  /uw/dial-ip/win
Directory for Macs:  /uw/dial-ip/mac
 I think a few people wanted this info. If it doesn't work then I give up!
Yarg! ciao, J.

Ignore it.  I discovered it's fixed in 3.92.  Great!

You can use the very handy space bar to go a page down and `-' (minus)
to go one page up.

Not actually a bug, merely a misfunction.

When enabling the mouse control in xterm it seems impossible to use the
X Window text mark and paste.  Actually the text cannot be marked anymore.

I don't know if it is possible to made mouse sensible only the meaningful
regions of the xterm window (those displaying pine commands) while
leaving the text part behaving the normal way.

Another annoying behavior on the same topic is that the marked text gets
lost (from the marked text buffer, not only as highlight on the window)
if pine window is refreshed (^L), after a ** operation completion (folder
update?) or if switching to another message.  Brief: after any operation
that changes/updates pine window.  This is not the normal behavior of
xterm window without pine running in it.

Great product anyway!!

    You may need to check what characters your terminal or PC or Mac is
actually sending out.  On some keyboards, with the ^ above the 6, you
might need to be sure to press the shift key.  Another approach is to
use the key sequence

        ESC ESC ^

    Probably you can't.  I don't think Pico and the Pine composer have
an overtype mode.  For my own use, I have replaced them (in Pine via
the alternate-editor feature) with jpico, a configuration of the JOE
editor which looks and feels a lot like a superset of Pico with added
features.  jpico can toggle back and forth between insert and overtype
modes.  (You can also set margins, even if you have not yet upgraded to
the new Pine 3.92., and do other things, all the while maintaining a
lot of the look and feel of Pico.)

Message-Id: <1996Mar25.171438.7804@venus.gov.bc.ca>
Date: 25 Mar 96 17:14:38 PST

Would it be possible to allow keys to be remapped?  I believe I have
seen responses saying it must be system independent.  What if a 
supplementary program converted a text file to a binary file?  Here
is a suggestion:

Create terminal definition files in the form:
      [xterm]
      ; Left side : Name of key (excluding control keys).
      ; Right side: Key sequence associated/generated by the key.
      Tab=\011
      Return=\015
      Backspace=^H
      Esc=\e
      Left=\e[D
      F1=\e[11~

      [Pine]
      ; Left side : an internal code used by Pine.
      ; Right side: a short name assigned to the internal code.
      1000=Show Keys
      1001=Help
      2000=Send Mail

      [Pine-xterm]
      ; Map Pine key (left side) to terminal key (right side).
      Show Keys=^K
      Send Mail=^X
      Mark=^^
      Mark=Esc Esc ^
      Right=Right

When the user presses "Show Keys", they see a context-sensitive help
screen.  If window cannot fit on screen, allow scrolling:
   +-+---------------------------------------------------------------+
   |^| Show Keys          ^K           Send Mail              ^X     |
   +-+ Mark               ^^           Help                   F1     |
   | |                    Esc Esc ^    Refresh                ^L     |
   | | Justify            ^J           PrevPage               -      |
   +-+ Left               Left         Right                  Right  |
   |v| < etc > < etc >                                               |
   +-+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Advantages are:
   - Portability is maintained.
   - Language independent (more or less).
   - Keys can be re-mapped to work with more terminals.
   - Keys can be re-mapped to be similar to other products.
   - Keys can be removed from the map if sys admin wants to disable
     them.
   - Terminal definitions can be shared between applications (Pilot,
     Pine, Pico).

To improve speed, this key map could be "compiled" into structures that
Pine could read using C binary read.  These files could be placed in
a Pine search path.

I have compiled Pine 3.92 on ("uname -a"):
   dgux themis.ag.gov.bc.ca R4.11 generic AViiON mc88110

To do so, I had to change 4 files.  DG/UX 4.11 has resolved the problem
with "utime".  I have included the "diff" output so "patch" could be
used to apply the changes.

The address book is a simple text file.  You can modify it directly.
Backup ".addressbook" and ".addressbook.lu".  WARNING: Watch out for
text editors that convert tabs to spaces.

<nick name><tab><Full Name><tab><address>
e.g.
Jamie	Royer, Jamie	jroyer@themis.ag.gov.bc.ca
is	IS Department	(Jamie,Rob,Vern)

Not the ultimate solution, but it may save some time.

I get the impression that when signing a message (haven't tried 
encryption), the signature only covers the text part of the email, not 
the enclosure(s). I just tried it (to myself) and the PGP lines (the ones 
with the dashes) seem to be around the message body sans enclosure.

Is this true? This is somewhat undesireable...

P.S. I'm using the scripts posted on here recently. They work well 
otherwise! Thanks!

	*Not True*

	Simply use the shift+M1 to mark and shift+M2 to paste....

	Please read help associated with functions.....

        FEATURE: enable-mouse-in-xterm

This feature controls whether or not an X terminal mouse can be used with
Pine.  If set, and the $DISPLAY variable indicates that an X terminal is
being used, the left mouse button on the mouse can be used to select text
or commands.

Note: if this feature is set, the behavior of xterm cut-and-paste is also
modified.  It is necessary to hold the shift key down while clicking left
or middle mouse buttons for the normal xterm cut/paste operations.

Its impossible within Pine itself, but it is possible to block mail
within the system.

I don't know if this method will work with your system, but on the system
at Aberystwtyh University, you can create/edit a file called .mailfilter,
which is located in the directory before 'mail':


For your purposes create the following lines:

if (!delivered && $(from)==/abc@def.ghi.jk/)
{
delivered=TRUE;
}

    Blocks all mail from abc@def.ghi.jk

if (!delivered)
{
unixfile "mail/INBOX";
}


   Tells where to stick mail from any other address.

	Yes, it is true.  Actually, it is desireable from a security
standpoint.

	Each attachment should be signed as a seperate act.  The reason
being that if it were not then detaching the item from the message would
destroy the ability to verify the signature.  This is especially true
when you are attaching documents from more than one source.

I was wondering if someone could help me in setting up a mail sorter for

I've just started using Layers on my shell account and it doesn't seem to 
work well with pine.  I can open it and look at my mail but if I leave it 
open it won't update.  Other programs(tin, tinyfugue, etc.) will let me 
know when mail arrives, but it won't show up unless I quit and return or 
expunge some messages.

Is there a way to fix this? an option or something in setup?

Help!!

I'm trying to install PC-PINE.  I've extracted the archive, and placed it
into its own directory.  When I run pine.exe it asks me where my inbox is
stored.  I provide a path to my local inbox, and save it in the pinerc
file.  Pine then beeps at me and tells me that no such folder exists!

I've checked the spelling, case (not that case should matter on a PC), and
pathname.  All are correct.  I've tried it both with and without "inbox"
on the end of the path...  I've tried it with and without a leading C:...
I've tried putting my inbox in the root of C:...  All to no avail.

Pine hates me.  It won't read my mailbox.  I really want to use this program
can anyone help?

The following is indeed true, but you may also need to enable the "*"
command first of all ... it is not available by default.

Go to the Main Menu, then type S followed by C to get to the Setup
Configuration screen.  Look down the list for "enable-flag-command" (or
similar, I forget the exact name) and check it.

Cheers,

When I select an address from the address book and this address has an Fcc
defined, this Fcc is not used in the Fcc header of the mail message being
composed. For example, if I want to sent mail to this list, I want all mail
to be stored in my folder for Pine. Problem is that I can only define a
single Fcc ("sent-mail") or extract the correct Fcc from the address, but
in many situations, I don't want to use the generated Fcc, but the Fcc I
define in the address book.

However, when I want to save a message to a folder, Pine can take the Fcc
from the address book and use this as the destination folder. It would be
nice if this also applies to the composed messages.

Kees.

Thanks for the info.  I verified a few things and found out that I'm
getting this message because of a global addressbook that I don't have
rights to update.  Thanks!

    ...Only if they think to do so.

One possibility, if your site is running the latest sendmail, is to use
the REDIRECT feature, which can be used to mail a message back to the
sender telling them to send the mail to your new address.  Your System
Administrator will need to set this up.

Here is what I have:
inbox-path={themis.ag.gov.bc.ca}INBOX
folder-collections={themis.ag.gov.bc.ca}/home/bm71569/mail/[]

I'm currently having problems with having to continuously logon.
Look at INBOX, logon, look at Folders, logon, etc.

Are you using imapd or POP?  Looking at your inbox setting, you are
trying to use imapd (it is the default).

If you are using imapd, is it running on the AIX machine?  See
"technotes.txt" for information.

If you are using POP, your inbox setting should be:
   {cvmbs2.vetmed.colostate.edu/pop3}INBOX
                               ^^^^^
Don't ask me what needs to be running on AIX to make POP work.

I read a message in this group earlier today that said the Unix and PC
files are in different formats.  It said to "save" (or copy?) messages
from the Unix folder to a PC folder using built-in Pine functions.

I use both netscape and pine to read my mail, and I have some questions
about setting up folders in pine. 

First I wonder if pine can get the mail in $MAIL at startup and
automaticly putting it in another folder. 

Second how can I get Pine to accept a file that already exist as a
folder

third can I share the same folders in netscape as in pine

If there is a faq that can solve my problem please tell me.

Thanks for anny information

What Sven is trying to say (although not very tactfully) is that PINE and
TIN are 2 different programs.  PICO on the other hand is a word processor
(actually an editor) that PINE uses by default (although you can change
that).  It makes no difference what 'editor' you use to make your
.signature file with (you could make it with pico, vi, any other editor),
what matters is that the 'program' you are using be told to look for a
file, where to look for it, and to attach it, and where to attach it, and
maybe even when to attach it.  Hope this helps.  BYE.  (sig follows)

Do you mean that pine will not display the entire header when forwarding
messages or that it somehow loses the forwarding information in the 
process of forwarding mail?  Have you tried pressing the 'h' key 
while examining a forwarded message?  Just a thought...

Yes, but ... not with PINE alone (at least not with 3.91, dunno about 
3.92 but I don't think so from what I have read) ... you need a mail 
filtering program such as PROCMAIL (there are others).  BYE.

Sometimes Shift-Ctrl-^ works, or just ^6 (ie. unshifted).
Depends on how the platform handles the keyboard.

I download mail from home on Netscape 2.01 as well as read it from school,
and there is already a file in my inbox that the IMAP server uses that is
read-only.  How can I make other messages that I receive read-only?

Greetings!

I have Pine3.92 running on an DEC OSF box.  In my .pinerc, and in the main
menu config, I have enabled the enable-incoming-folders feature.  I then
have a moderate size list of incoming mail folders (about 30) that I have
procmail filter mail to.  This all worked fine under Pine3.91, and it
still works, kind of in 3.92.

In Pine3.91 when I was in my main INBOX and press TAB, it would then cycle
through my incoming folder collection.  This collection includes four IMAP
servers, which I use the new /user= feature with, and about 26 (or so)
local folders.  Pine3.91 would check each folder, and then stop on the
next folder that had messages that I had not seen (Note that I do
distinguish between the NEW and SEEN flags, so I know it's normal for Pine
to skip folders that have NEW messages).  When I press TAB in Pine3.92,
all is great, while I am going through the remote IMAP mail boxes.
HOWEVER, when I get to the first local folder that has new mail, Pine
displays the new mail and then continues checking the next folder, the one
after that and so on!  If Pine then finds another folder with new mail in
it, I am jumped into that folder and Pine then continues to search again,
until it finds no more folders (Pine3.91 used to prompt to return to the
INBOX at this time).  It then leaves me in the last folder I was in.

Has anyone seen this before ?

Thanks!

Michael

Steve --

Question -- Has Pine 3.92 been officially released?  Or are we still
testing?  Should I wait for 3.93 for my user community or go with Pine
3.92?

TIA.

Hi. I set up the enable-8bit-esmtp-negotiation option, but pine 3.92
persist on MIME encoding. MTA on our IRIX is sendmail 8.6.9.
If I send an e-mail message in russian using mail program it goes fine
without MIME encoding or 8th bit striping. I tried to start sendmail with
8BITMIME option, but this didn't help.

Does anybody know how to handle it?

Thanks.

Pine 3.92 has definitely been released, but of course we are still testing
:-).  Whether or not you want to go with 3.92 in production or not depends
on how much of a risk taker you are.  The plan is to have 3.93 be more
solid than 3.92.  It will be a mostly bug-fix release.  However, some of
the bugs are logic bugs that are requiring some significant rewriting, so
there's no guarantee that 3.93 will be more stable than 3.92, just an
expectation that it will be.  We are using 3.92 in production on the Univ.
of Washington central computing systems.  There are some known bugs (like
the one you reported).

Sendmail 8.6.* does not support 8BITMIME. You need a newer version (I
think the newest and stable enough is 8.7.5--we are runnig it here for
some time). In fact, version 8.6.9 have some serious security bugs so
there are also security reasons to upgrade. Having upgraded you have to
set the pine `smtp-server' variable to the machine running this new
sendmail (`localhost' is enough for sendmail running on the same machine.
But it is necessary to set up the mailertable using smtp8 mailer for all
domains being 8bit clean and using older sendmails (not 8.7.*) and
important to install new sendmail wherever possible.

Hope it helps.

This is exactly right, and is unavoidable unless everyone is using 3.92.
Once the majority of the users are using 3.92, the administrator ought to
remake that .lu file and then the message will go away.  In the meantime,
if some people are using 3.91 and some are using 3.92, one or the other
group will have to see this message, because the format of the .lu file
changed between 3.91 and 3.92.

That's how it's supposed to work.  The fcc from the address book should
always override any fcc-rule that you may have set.  If it's not working,
there may be a bug we need to fix.  If you can tell us exactly what
keystrokes you go through to get this to happen, that would help.

One possible confusing point:  If you go into the composer and then use ^T
to select an address for the To field, the fcc won't show up until you
move out of the To field.  Thanks.

	Yes!  I have seen this exact same problem on on two
	different different Linux boxes (one running sendmail-
	8.7.3, and the other running sendmail-8.7.5).

The problem may have something to do with the Sendmail command Pine is
using to send the mail.  I ran into the following two snags when I first
tried to bring up Pine 3.92 on a BSD/OS (BSDI) 2.01 system:

(1) Sendmail on this system is /usr/sbin/sendmail.  Pine was trying to
    invoke the nonexistent /usr/lib/sendmail, obviously without success.

    If Ashok's Linux system doesn't have a /usr/lib/sendmail, I suppose
    this could account for his problem.

(2) I examined my personal ".pinerc" file and included Sendmail's true
    path name as follows:       sendmail-path=/usr/sbin/sendmail

    However, mail still bounced, albeit in a slightly different way.
    Pine didn't give me any errors, but everything I tried to send wound
    up in my ~/dead.letter file.

    It turns out that if you use a "sendmail-path" value, you must give
    not only the path name to Sendmail, but also the command line argu-
    ments to be used when calling Sendmail.  The following configuration
    line seemed to work fine:

		sendmail-path=/usr/sbin/sendmail -oi -oem -t

In the end, since it happens that I have sysadmin-level control over the
system in question, I became superuser and created a symbolic link from
/usr/lib/sendmail to /usr/sbin/sendmail.  Presumably, I could have gone
into pine/osdep/os-bsi.h and changed the "#define SENDMAIL" to use the
correct path (i.e., /usr/sbin/sendmail).  Since setting up this link and
commenting out the "sendmail-path" line, I can send mail without diffi-
culty using Pine 3.92.

Yes, this attachment type header is generated by ELM ME version.  I
had been looking at the source code for 2 days and finally get
a quite rude solution.  Disclaimer: I do not guarantee that it works
100% correctly.  Use at your own risk...  :^)


1.  at the file mailview.c, in pine directory,
    locate the portion "user_viewer = 0;" in the function
    void describe_mime(body, prefix, ...)

2.  add the following code after the "use_viewer = 0" :

/* modified by dominic@cs.ust.hk,
   to treat application/pgp as text/plain */
        /* this is for elm-me, which produces application/pgp */
        if (body->type == TYPEAPPLICATION) {
                if (!strucmp(body->subtype, "pgp")) {
                        body->type = TYPETEXT;
                        strcpy(body->subtype, "plain");
                }
        /* this is for elm-pgp, which produces application/X-pgp-message  */
                else if (!strucmp(body->subtype, "X-pgp-message")) {
                        body->type = TYPETEXT;
                        strcpy(body->subtype, "plain");
                }
        }

3.  recompile the pine source tree


My point on this hacking is to force application/pgp to be readed
as text/plain, so as to allow pine to proceed running the display
filter.

By the way, thanks for your display filter scripts on PGP.  :^)

Hi, my name is Eric Tomb, and I have had some problems with the new pine
configuration.

Every time I write a message to someone, it tells me that my file is too
large or that it can't copy my message to sent-mail.

Also, at the bottom of the screen, it says "Error closing file"

I've typed a couple of long messages, only to have them erased because I
didn't have enough space or something.

I never had this problem before, is there something that can be done?

				Thank you,
                                    Eric Tomb

Subject: local news with pine?
Date: 26 Mar 1996 09:19:43 -0500
Message-Id: <4j8udv$p6n@ASARian.org>


we have both a locally spooled usenet, (for a few newsgroups),
and a NNTP/NNRP host to use for other newsgroups not stored locally.

we'd like to be able to use the local news spool to read/post those
newsgroups we do carry, and to use NNTP to access the remote newsserver
for those we do not carry. 

3.91 doesn't seem to have an easy way to define 2 news sites,
1 via nntp the other via local reads (from newsspool). obviously
the sets of newsgroups will have differnet local article numbers,
but we were unable to find how to tell pine to use an alternate
.newsrc file (.newsrc is setup with the article numbers from the remote 
newsserver, .lnewsrc is setup with local article numbers. tin has a
option to use an alternate .newsrc file so we can handle this there ok.

how do we define an alternate .newsrc for pine to use seperate
from the .newsrc that is used when accessing the remote newsserver?

thanks again...

    BSD Sendmail only started to advertise 8BITMIME starting from 8.7 --
the latest release is 8.7.5.  In order for Pine to pass the message as
C-T-E: 8BIT to the sendmail program, you must be speaking with some
ESMTP server which supports 8BITMIME (one of many ESMTP options).

    Because your 8.6.9 sendmail cannot claim 8BITMIME (talk to it with
EHLO to see what it supports), Pine resorts to doing the MIME conversion
itself.

    If you have a compiler for your SGI, you can obtain the 8.7.5 source
and compile and install.  If you do not, you may have more difficulty
locating a pre-compiled version.

    There are more than a half-dozen other MTAs I have encountered which
speak 8BITMIME, including the zmailer from Finland, PMDF, some HP
sendmail, the Emil package which has been added to sendmail 8.6 in
Scandinavian countries, and certain MTAs which lay claim to 8BITMIME
without understanding what it means.  For a review of the latter, I refer
you to comp.mail.mime (crossposted to .sendmail).  You may encounter
``problems'' in the .ru and .su domains when sending your 8BITMIME message
to others -- this has been recently discussed to death in those groups I
mention.

The default formats are indeed different, but PC-Pine should be able
to _read_ a folder written in the default Berkeley Unix format.
PC-Pine can only write it's default MTX format.

Going the other way, Unix Pine can read and write PC-Pine MTX folders.

I'm sorry to ask this.  I have looked around, but with no success.

Is pine 3.92 avialable in or near the UK.  My ftp attempts to Washington
(Seattle?, Spokane?) have all ended up poorly.

Subject: Need help setting up PC-PINE

Help!!

I'm trying to install PC-PINE.  I've extracted the archive, and placed it
into its own directory.  When I run pine.exe it asks me where my inbox is
stored.  I provide a path to my local inbox, and save it in the pinerc
file.  Pine then beeps at me and tells me that no such folder exists!
The line in pinerc reads:
   inbox-path=C:\PROGRAM FILES\INTERNET ACCESSORIES\INBOX
which is a valid pathname.

I've checked the spelling, case (not that case should matter on a PC), and
pathname.  All are correct.  I've tried it both with and without "inbox"
on the end of the path...  I've tried it with and without a leading C:...
I've tried putting my inbox in the root of C:...  I tried putting in the
old-style short names for the long directory names...  All to no avail.

I have also tried adding a remote mailbox with the format
   incoming-folders={mail.crl.com/pop3}INBOX
This gets me an error message that I have an "invalid remote specification".
I don't see how it is incorrect, but apparantly it is.

Pine hates me.  It won't read my INBOX locally, nor remotely.  I really want
to use this program.  Pine may hate me, but I hate Eudora!  Can anyone help?

Hi All,
I did used yesterday the option in the menu (when

Postpone.
Does anyone how I can send those messages ? I did
try to find any command that deals with that but
I was not able to find it.
I have notice that a folder called postponed-messages
was created but I do not know how to handle it.
thanks

The problem here is that on most freenets, one often does not have direct 
access to one's home directory.  To have your mail forwarded on most freenets,
go to the post office where you should find an option that says something
about mail forwarding.  Through this, you will be able to create a
.forward file.  You just won't have any indication that that is the name of 
the file you are creating... You will just be asked to type in the
address to which you want the mail forwarded.

Why do I have the sign "-->" instead of highlighted lines in the left 
margin of the Index ? I don't want the "--->" How do I configure Pine 
3.92 Win95 to highlight the selected line instead ?

Yesterday an automatic change to PINE occurred. Here are some of the
problems experienced.

While PINE is invoked, new messages are not signaled or registered. They
are only detected after exiting PINE and seeing immediately that there are
new msgs in the mail spool.

New msgs are tagged 'N' to signal they are unread. After reading them the
'N' tags are removed. After exiting PINE and reentering, the previously
read msgs are again tagged with 'N'.

	In UNIX pine you disable:

            [ ]  assume-slow-link

	But there may be other things that are causing pine to "think" you
are on a slow link.

using PINE 3.91 is there any way to  Blind Carbon Copy to individuals.  I 
regularly mail to a distribution list of 100 and all the addresses get 
sent with the message (which is often only a couple of lines long.  It 
gets tedious paging through a hundred CC addresses to get the message.

	Yes, there is.  When you are in the address portion you can use
Ctrl-R and the Bc: will appear.  However, you may want to go to 3.92 since
it has a nice new feature call Lcc:

I have found the problem: it was me ;-) I now set the configuration to use
the default Fcc. Now I get the Fcc from the address book (if available)
and otherwise the default Fcc.

Until now we have used SCO UNIX as mailserver running imapd.

We are now thinking on changing to Windows NT. For that reason I'd very 
much like to know if a imapd version exists for Win. NT and if at all 
Win NT can be used as server for pine ?

Thanks in advance

Just use the "C" command to start composing a message as usual.

Before starting a new message Compose checks if any messages are currently
postponed and offers you the chance to resume one of them.

This is explained in the on-line help built in to the Compose Message
screen (just type ^G when composing a message and look through the help
for information about Postpone).

Cheers,

I compiled it on my unixware 2.03 box at home and had the exact same

Thanks.  Part of my problem was also that my "userid" config option
was set to "jroyer" and not my login "bm71569".  Once I changed this
and added "Reply-to" in my "customized-hdrs", I can change between
folders - logging in only once.

Yes, you need  to uncomment that line if  you want to be able  to change your
personal name on outgoing e-mails.

The default is still not to allow changing from. It's in pine/osdep/os-xxx.h,
where xxx is the abbreviation for your operating system (e.g. osf).

The only  thing I've found  that's changed is  that... it doesn't  work! Pine
appears to let me  change my name, but when I send a  message out, whatever I
put as my personal  name, it always says "From: Simon  <syb3..." (the name in
my .pinerc). I don't know what's up with that or if it's just me. Anyone else
experienced the same thing when trying  to change their personal name? Anyone
been successful?!

Oh well, I sent it in as a bug report, anyway.

I got this message this morning.  From the Main Menu, I pressed "I"
for index, then "C" for compose.  I could then compose a message.

Don't ask me why.

Dear Sir,

I have seen in the set up menu that there is some file for a signature 
but can you tell me how I can actually make one that will go at the end 
of all my messages?

Thanks,

Sunil Chamund.

You can find the imapd-server for Windows NT at the University of 
Washington ftp.cac.washington.edu.
But you must make some changes in the source code depending on what 
smtp-server for windows you are using.

I have been sent a mail message that when you scroll down it it changes 
the characters on the screen into gibberish ... this is obviously a non 
harmful prank, but I was wondering if I could do something similar but 
non destructive ... can anyone tell me how it's done?

Is there a way to set up Pine so that I have two folders. One which would 
receive messages specifically addressed to me and the other folder for 
all messages incoming from listserver's, etc?

Following yesterday's msg to whichever group writes PINE, I found I am
unable to delete messages. A script comes up saying everything is
READ-ONLY. Another bug is that my SENT-MAIL box has messages that are all
addressed to me, i.e., the original recipient's names have been removed
and replaced by my name.

These bugs are becoming serious. I would like to get the old version of
PINE (before 3.92) running again if possible as I never experienced any
problems with it.

    It is probably not a wise or courteous idea to try this sort of
thing, even if others do it.  What happens when you put supposed
control characters in a mail message all depends on the recipient's
terminal hardware and software, which you, the sender, have no control
over and may well not even know.  It might might a harmless prank or it
could cause a recipient a lot of noxious problems.  Please don't do it.

Yes:
Put both the forward address and you own address into the .forward and
a backslash before your own local address to prevent recursion.

Example:
\guckes,user@domain

>Or perhaps have it filed in a different mailbox after it has been forwarded?

Filing must be done via a filter program. (I think)
Thus you'd have to install a filter and set up the rules for it.

Take a look at ELM's filter - it allows rules which read thus:
	if (from = address) then save ~/newmail/IN.mailing.list

Info is on page
	http://www.math.fu-berlin.de/~guckes/elm/elm.filter.html

I'm surprised that Pine makes a special case of passing the escape
through (see ttyout.c, stanza on if(ch == '\033'), in 3.91).  

At Columbia we found we had to modify Pine and a few others to display
character "?" for escape, in response to repeated user problems with
terminals locking up or being set to weird displays.  In Pine, if the
escape is in the From or Subject lines, user cannot even see the index
of messages because of the screen disruption.

But sendmail-8.6.9 manual claims to know 8BITMIME and so does the
postscript document from the doc/op directory in sendmail's distribution.
I cann't say that I understand everything about terms 8BITMIME, ESMTP,
"Eight-bit clean", but what I can say for sure is that 8-bit mail message=
s
sent with the "mail" program or  sendmail (on command line) go fine
between our two our systems, one of them running sendmail-8.6.9, the othe=
r
sendmail-8.6.12. No seven bit stripping or MIME encoding occurs.
But when I use pine it always do MIME encoding on 8-bit text.
Why wouldn't pine 3.92 just pass on  8bit messages to sendmail?

Anyway I have just installed sendmail-8.7.5 on my IRIX 5.3 and set
localhost as a smtp server, but still pine does MIME encoding. What have =
I
missed?

I just want to try to prevent some possible confusion about this.  It
shouldn't matter which fcc-name-rule you select in the Setup/Config
screen.  In all cases, an explicit fcc defined in your address book should
override whatever the fcc-name-rule comes up with.

Pine 3.92 defaults to suppressing this for "certain control characters",
under the control of a new configuration variable.  Here's the extract
from the on-line help:

        FEATURE: pass-control-characters-as-is

This feature controls how certain characters contained in messages are
displayed.  If set, all characters in a message will be sent to the
screen.  Normally, control characters are automatically suppressed in
order to avoid inadvertently changing terminal setup parameters.

<End of help on this topic>

What does the compile-time option USE_QUOTAS do? It states that if it
is enabled, quotas will be checked on startup. We have a quota set
for incoming mail, so do I need this? Does pine do some kind of 
notification of its own if you enable this?

If I take an otherwise-kosher mailbox file with several messages in it,
prepend a blank line, and run pine on it, pine will not recognize that
there's more than one message--instead, it shows one message, whose name
is the same as the name of the mailbox file, and whose contents are the
contents of the entire file. (Is this pine's way of indicating that the
mailbox file is corrupt?)

mailx doesn't have a problem with files beginning with blank lines.

Thanks
Alex

Yes, set up a list.
I suggest you go to the addressbook (M A) and then type ? to get
addressbook help data. Look for information on lists.

Obviously I'm missing something simple here.

My INBOX exists -prior- to installing PC-PINE.  I currently have about 50-60 
incoming email messages in my INBOX.  This is a local berkeley mailbox format 
file in a valid folder, created by a POP3 client external to PC-PINE.  I also 
have a duplicate INBOX in the same exact format (with the same exact 
contentes) on my POP3 mailserver at mail.crl.com.

I am attached to a POP3 mailserver.  In my pinerc, I have defined a inbox

   inbox-path=C:\PROGRAM FILES\INTERNET ACCESSORIES\INBOX

and 

   incoming-folders={mail.crl.com/pop3}.mailbox

PC-PINE tells me that the pre-existant INBOX at the path specifified does not 
exist (even though it does), and then tells me that my remote specification is 
invalid (even though it is not).

What am I doing wrong?

Hi All,
Can anyone of you tell me how I can do to put the signature file at
the end of the message because when I choose to reply with the content
of the other message I got the signature at the beginning of my message
and the text of the other message after the signature.
thanks,

Hi,

I've just been trying out PCPine when I suddenly discovered I couldn't 
select a group of messages in a folder with this version, even though 
the help says I can. Neither is the 'a' command. I don't think I need to 
configure it in Setup do I?

Also, double clicking on a folder does not always open it; sometimes it 
opens the most recently opened one instead.


However, all in all I am impressed!
The mouse coordination certainly pushes it ahead of the unix version in 
those terms (but then I like clicking mouse buttons :-))

I think hacking pine source code and recompiling it is a little
ugly solution and not necessarily applicaple in large sites.

I have solved the problem with receiving mail written with Elm PGP
interfaces by adding the following three lines at the beginning of
my .procmailrc:

:0 Hfhw
* ^Content-Type:.*application/(x-pgp-message|pgp)
| formail -i "Content-Type: text/plain"

This changes Content-Type header to indicate just text/plain type
message so that pine is able to display it. Of course you have to
have procmail (with formail) installed.

We are using both PC-Pine and UNIX Pine ver. 3.92.

In the PC-Pine we have a problem. When we type in some sharacters (e.g \ or 
@ or ....) then after these characters pine(pico) shifts to a new line each 
time we press Space. To stop this behaviour we have to press CTRL-L. This 
means that each time we type in e.g. \ we also have to type in CTRL-L. 

The UNIX version of pine/pico doesn't have this error.

It isn't a new error. PC-Pine 3.92 also had it.

My question is...

		I am on a VAX VMS system using dumb VT terminal using
VAX VMS mail. Is there any software package that will allow my Vax to
connect to my internet service who offers Pine or ELM or UNIX mail?
I need a software package that will
allow me to send and recieve my internet mail from my  VMS MAILBOX.

				Thank you for taking the time

	Ah, try:

	           [X]  signature-at-bottom

	in the config.

	Another wise thing to do would be to go to setup/config and read
thru all of the features.  I've also found the release notes to be of
interest.

	One thing you can try, since April 1st is coming, is to sneak
up behind someone's terminal and with a pair of metal scissors cut the
power wires to their monitor.  It is sure to bring excitement into
everyones' lives.

Yup, you do.  Look for "enable-aggregate-cmds" or something similar.

Hello there,

I'm hoping that someone else has found a solution to using Pine with Wyse 
50/50+ emulation. If you have, please send me an email. My problem is getting 
the arrow keys mapped as arrow keys instead of sending control characters.

Any help will be greatly appreciated.


Thanks,

Just noticed: this setting isn't for posting, it's for reading. That is,
if you log in on someone else's account and look at the newsgroup index it
has your name in it. If you look at it from your account it says "To:
comp.mail.pine".

Weird, but doable.

Is it possible for Pine to stop cross-posted newsgroup articles appearing
in the lists for all the newsgroups its been cross-posted to? ie. if
you've read the article in one newsgroup, you don't see it appearing in
all the others.

I've been told by someone who doesn't use Pine that most newsreaders
should be able to deduce either from the message-id or Xref: line whether
its seen an article before.

Can Pine do this? If so, how can the feature be enabled?

    I'm guessing the reason for this is to handle charset switching for
ISO-2022-based MIME charsets which make use of an ESC sequence for
altering the user's display.  This would be one example of a constructive
use of special characters to affect the user's display.

    To the poser of the original question, so you want a constructive
assignment to make use of this principle?
    Get a pencil and paper.  Look through the man pages for X, or
reference books (O'Reilly), and make note of the sequence of characters
which can be used to change the font used by an xterm.  My memory tells me
that a ^G is used in it, but I have no reference at hand.
    Read the Pine3.92 notes on display filters.  Pay attention to the
CHARSET parameter.
    Write a simple program which outputs to the display, one of several
control sequences to change the font used in the Pine xterm, depending on
the charset of the message to be displayed.
    For extra credit, allow the user to specify the mapping from a charset
value to a desired font, and determine whether the user is using an xterm
Pine or not (won't work if Pine is not in an xterm).
    There.  How's that for something constructive?  I'm sure there will be
a lot of Pine users who will be very happy to use your manipulation of the
characters displayed on the screen.  Like me.  I'm too laz^H^H^Hbusy to
write something like this myself.

    From the limited testing I've done on the limited platforms available
to me, it seems that 3.92's idea of ``certain control characters'' also
includes most or all of the range of 8th-bit-set ISO control characters;
that is, 128 through 159 decimal, =80 through =9F in MIME Q-P (hex).

    Will these characters perform the same mischief as their corresponding
7-bit control characters (0-31 decimal) when passed to the terminal?

    As it turns out, these characters are printing characters in some
registered MIME character sets, including the PC-based KOI8-R (Russian
Cyrillic) and VISCII (Vietnamese).  What I have been seeing by default
with characters in this range are that they are replaced by the ``?''
character.  This may also extend to the PC versions of Pine which use DOS
code pages which are notorious for using this range of characters as
printing characters.

    The Pine authors are aware of these problems and some other
limitations on use of 8-bit characters, and I confess that I have not
thoroughly examined the results of all settings on the display that
results, nor whether the user's charset value affects the behavior of Pine
in any way.  These will not affect the majority of Pine users in the US or
in western Europe (PC-Pine a possible exception), but may be of concern to
Russian and other users.

    The question I ponder is whether it's appropriate to treat by default
those characters 128-159 as control characters, which is presumably safer
for displays, or as printing characters in the default, which would
accommodate non-ISO-8859-based MIME character sets without requiring the
user to configure anything.

	could you please let me know why this happens and whether it can be fixed ie stop creating those files?

We are on ("uname -a"):

I got it compiled and posted a message here on the changes that I made
to 4 files.  The new version of DG/UX has made changes to C libraries
making the compile easy.

Message-Id: <slrn4ljnli.bvg.lynch.94@osu.edu>
References: <4j1d72$1gf@news.mty.itesm.mx>

========= 
Here is my attempt at writing a "FAQ-like" description of how I got
the USERDB to work with pine.  This is now in the Sendmail FAQ (Maybe
this should go in PINE FAQ also?).  I encourage you to post a request
to comp.mail.sendmail for the USERDB to handle FQDNs.
BTW.  I'm using sendmail 8.6.12.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
  * How do I get the user database (userdb) to work with Pine.

        The basic incompatibility with Pine and the user database option
        is in how Pine writes From addresses in the header.  Most MUAs 
        write the From address as "From: user", while Pine, for reasons
        given in its documentation, write the From address as 
        "From: user@FQDN" (FQDN=fully qualified domain name).  Because of
        this difference, the user database does not rewrite pine headers.

        One solution to this problem is to make the following change in
        /etc/sendmail.cf after you have the user database option installed
        and working with other MUAs:

        In the "local info" section, add the following:

                # Define our userdb file for pine rewrites
                Kuserdb btree -o /etc/userdb.db

        After ruleset 0, add the following as ruleset 1:

   ##################################################
   ### Ruleset 1, rewrite sender header & envelope ##
   ##################################################
   #Thanks to Bjart Kvarme <bjart.kvarme@usit.uio.no>
   S1
   R$- < @ $=w . > $*   $: $1 < @ $2 . > $3 ?? $1       username@localhost ?
   R$+ ?? $+            $: $1 ?? $(userdb $2 : mailname $: @ $)
   R$+ ?? @             $@ $1                           Not found
   R$+ ?? $+            $>3 $2                          Found, rewrite
   #NOTE      ^^^^^^^^^^       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   #          Use Tab Characters  Use Tab Characters in these regions
   # to make three columns (the line with "mailname" only has 2 columns).

        Now the user database should re-write messages sent with Pine.

        If this still does not work for you, try adding the following
        to either the system wide pine.conf, pine.conf.fixed, or your 
        personal .pinerc:

                user-domain=localhost

        This has been known to help solve the problem for some people.
        ** The drawback of setting the user-domain is Pine 3.92 gives
	   you error messages since localhost is not a FQDN...but if
           you just ignore the warnings, things should work.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Any thanks for the above should be sent to: Bjart Kvarme
<bjart.kvarme@usit.uio.no> who was kind enough to post this solution a
while back.

The following is something I've posted before:
=========
Here is my attempt at writing a "FAQ-like" description of how I got the 
USERDB to work with pine.  I sent this to the Sendmail FAQ, but it
hasn't been added since I last checked.  I'm using an older version of
sendmail (8.6.12 I think), so there are no guarantees.  I would
encourage you to post a "feature request" or the likes to
comp.mail.sendmail about this. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
  * How do I get the user database (userdb) to work with Pine.

        The basic incompatibility with Pine and the user database option
        is in how Pine writes From addresses in the header.  Most MUAs 
        write the From address as "From: user", while Pine, for reasons
        given in its documentation, write the From address as 
        "From: user@FQDN" (FQDN=fully qualified domain name).  Because of
        this difference, the user database does not rewrite pine headers.

        One solution to this problem is to make the following change in
        /etc/sendmail.cf after you have the user database option installed
        and working with other MUAs:

        In the "local info" section, add the following:

                # Define our userdb file for pine rewrites
                Kuserdb btree -o /etc/userdb.db

        After ruleset 0, add the following as ruleset 1:

   ##################################################
   ### Ruleset 1, rewrite sender header & envelope ##
   ##################################################
   #Thanks to Bjart Kvarme <bjart.kvarme@usit.uio.no>
   S1
   R$- < @ $=w . > $*   $: $1 < @ $2 . > $3 ?? $1       username@localhost ?
   R$+ ?? $+            $: $1 ?? $(userdb $2 : mailname $: @ $)
   R$+ ?? @             $@ $1                           Not found
   R$+ ?? $+            $>3 $2                          Found, rewrite
        
   #NOTE      ^^^^^^^^^^       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   #          Use Tab Characters  Use Tab Characters in these regions
   # to make three columns (the line with "mailname" only has 2 columns).

        Now the user database should re-write messages sent with Pine.

        If this still does not work for you, try adding the following
        to either the system wide pine.conf, pine.conf.fixed, or your 
        personal .pinerc:

                user-domain=localhost

        This has been known to help solve the problem for some people.
	** The drawback of this is Pine 3.92 gives you error messages
	   since localhost is not a FQDN...but if you just ignore the
	   warnings, things still work.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Any thanks for the above should be sent to: Bjart Kvarme 
<bjart.kvarme@usit.uio.no> who was kind enough to post this solution a
while back.

I think from this it works well (from pine). I think the problem is in a
different place as eplaned later in this letter

Maybe it does (I had never has it) but the sendmail program (version
8.6.9) does _not_ say it about itself via ESMTP protocol--thus pine does
not know the sendmail _is_ 8BITMIME.

8-bit-cleans means the program never strips off the 8th bit of any byte.

ESMTP is an extension of the SMTP protocol for mail exchnge and allows
some non-standard thinks (strictly said sendaing 8bit text is illegal in
SMTP).

8BITMIME means the program is able to handle 8bit MIME
Content-Transfer-Encoding: and is able to encode it to some 7bit MIME
encoding if the recepient does not have (and claim!) this ability, too.
This is my opinion, not the cited RFC!

This depends on configuration of both sendmails so you cannot be sure
(sendaing mail) it will always be O.K.

Because the Pine Team likes conforming standards (and sending 8bit data t=
o
programs not claiming themselves to be 8BITMIME does not conform RFC) and
because it is their program and they can do in it what they like :-)

(I suppose enable-8bit-esmtp-negotiation option is set) If you send mail
to a user on the same computer? If so, I cannot help you (and it should
probably be a bug in Pine). If the user is on another computer, then MIME
Quoted-Printable encoding may be done by sendmail itself (and Pine sands
it 8bit) in cases when the recepient's sendmail is not 8BITMIME (i. e.
older then 8.7.*) and smtp8 mailer is _not_ used. Thus check that:

1) All recepients' sendmails are 8BITMIME compliant (8.7.*) and when ther=
e
computers you cannot change the version

2) Change the sendmail.cf file to allow the mailertable lookup (you
probably need sendmail compiled with the -DNEWDB compiling option) and pu=
t
all domains with such 8bit-clean but not 8BITMIME sendmails it this file
(very dangerous solution is put there the whole domain .ru and .su and
change it only for subdomains not using 8-bit-cleans sendmails). Details
are in the sendmail (i think) cf/cf/README or cf/README manuals.

Hope it helps

V. S.

P. S.  You may send me a testing letter containing 8bit data as I have an
8BITMIME sendmail to address (vs@site.cas.cz). Then I will reply you if i=
t
comes 8bit or QP encoded.

	You can start pine with -d0 and no debug files will be produced.
The alternative is to recompile with the appropriate changes.

I've been having the same problem.  I've looked at the Help text you
mention, but didn't understand how this applied to the problem.  Could you
tell us more (like what do we do to get the defaults back the way they
were before 3.92)?

Getting your arrow keys to work is relatively easy if you follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have the new Pine 3.92.

   This is the first release of Pine that will allow you to use the
   termcap/terminfo files; a necessity to get your Wyse 50 to work.

2. Edit the files pine/makefile.<platform> and pico/makefile.<platform>
   to include "-DTERMCAP_WINS" at the line defining STDCFLAGS.
   On my SCO system, this now looks like:

   STDCFLAGS=   -DSCO -DSYSTYPE=\"SCO\" -DMOUSE -DTERMCAP_WINS

3. Recompile Pine & Pico.

   Because the makefiles do not check if they were modified themselves, you
   will need to force a rebuild. The easiest way to do this is to run "build
   clean". Alternatively, you can manually remove the following files:

     pico/osdep.o
     pico/tcap.o  or pico/tinfo.o
     pine/ttyout.o

4. Execute "build <platform>"

5. Enjoy your newly built Pine!


It needs to be said that you can no longer use certain ctrl-key combinations
to activate function from pine and/or pico. For example, Ctrl-K (Cut Text)
will now do a cursor-up, since that is the code being sent by the cursor-up
key from a Wyse 50. To cut text, you should press ESC-ESC-k instead.

Just keep in mind that any control key combination can be replaced by
pressing escape twice, followed by the key you would normally press with
the control key.

Feel free to contact me if you require further assistance.

Good luck!

Best regards,

- Richard Gering.


P.S.  I've actually composed this message using a Wyse 50 emulation.
      Due to the limitations described above, it's not quite like working
      on the ANSI based terminals I normally use, but it does work.

What version of pine 3.92 do you need ? UNIX, Windows3.x or Win95

I can put them on our anonymous ftp if you want. It is

slam.aar.vki.dk (130.225.8.239)

login as ftp or anonymous.

You can try if you can reach the ftp site and let me know which of the 
pine versions you want

Message-Id: <4jhfng$gk5@tali.UCHSC.edu>

i'm running pine 3.91 on a unix osf/1 system. i was writing on a
previously postponed message when my computer seriously froze and i had no
choice but to turn it off.

i was hoping that even if pine hadn't saved the new stuff i had been
writing that seesion, that since it was a previously postponed message,
that it would still be postponed, from the point it had been postponed before.
(boy, does that sound complicated ;) )

however, it's completely disappeared! i am in despair. is there a unix
file somewhere that pine saves dead stuff in that i can retrieve? even
better (and i know this may not fit in this discussion) the shell i was
running when it crashed still shows up when i use "ps" (as does pine)-- is
there _any_ way i can get back into that inactive shell, save the message &
get back out? or is there a way to use "kill" so that, during cleanup, it
saves the postponed message?

pleasepleaseplease help me! it was a big message.

thanks much in advance.

gl.

Hello Everyone --

I'm running Pine on an DEC Alpha 3300 under OSF v2.0.  My system printer 
is a DEC LG06 Line Printer, which is attached to a DECServer 250.  This 
printer is also used via the DECServer by a MicroVAX 3100.

Whenever Pine users print messages that are longer than one page, the
printer almost always skips a blank page between page one and page three
of the message. Pine is the only application in which this occurs.  If I 
print from the unix prompt, or from any other appllication on my system, 
everything prints fine.

Any ideas?

Thanks in advance,

Mary Aplin

fine there. So, the problem is a peculiarity between Word 7.0 and Pine. If
anyone has a suggestion, please let me know.

Thanks, Chuck Ainslie

    Have you turned on enable-aggregate-command-set in your
Configuration?  If you haven't, ';' probably won't work.

Is it possible to configure Windows95 so that Pine becomes the Default 
e-mailer ?

When I e.g. am using the Windows95 Internet Explorer and want to send an 
e-mail to an address on a web page then the MS Exchange is automatically 
started. I dn't want to use that, because I'm using imap and have all my 
saved e-mail folders on one e-mail server and use this foldercollection 
from different computers. The MS-exchange-email can't save e-mails to these 
folders or read them or share adressbooks.

I take it that it isn't at all possible to get MS-exchange to use imap ?

There is one feature of Pine that I absolutely hate, hopefully someone
will know how to turn it off.

When I receive a message that is a response from something I posted to
usenet, occasionally Pine wants to send my reply to that message to
usenet, not to the person who sent the mail to me.  I then have to cancel
my letter and start over.  I *never* want to post a response in e-mail to
usenet.

Totally dependent on your Wyse 50 emulation software.  Your solutions can
vary.  You need to elaborate more about your environment to offer any
viable solutions.

Yea, this is a bug.  If you miss the folder name by a little and
double click on an in-active area then wpine will open the _currently_
selected folder, probably the most recently opened one.

The new feature 'print-offers-custom-cmd-prompt' is very usefull. It
would be very nice to have the same option for spelling. Here, we use
ispell but frequently need to swith from 1 language to another. Going
through the Setup menu is not very easy for normal users... It would be
much easier with a feature similar to custom print promt.

A related problem we had until someone had an extra cup of coffee one
morning was that, even after we had a big PC-Pine installation, the
Unix systems folk still expected everyone to be running Pine on Unix,
where an rsh was done to make the connection to our mail server,
rather than listening on port 143.

The result was that, even though the daemon to listen on port 143 was
turned ojn, it had been done manually and didn't amke it into the
standard places to automatically initiate on re-boot.  So each time
the mail server was downed, the port 143 listener wasn't there when it
came back up.  A good stiff cup of coffee and repeatedly fixing the
same problem enough times fixed this system problem.  It's really a
matter of the vantage point of the sys admins.

The only problem with this approach is that the user gets hit with
the attachment menu, and has to hit a few more keystrokes to get it
to display.  I figure that's no big deal, but others have expressed
differing opinions. :)

I'd say that if you've got the access, then recompiling the pine
source is the optimum way to do it, just remember that you'll increase
your workload come next patch/version.

(Just curious -- does 8859-5 see much use in .ru/.su ?  I was under the
impression that KOI8-R was almost the only MIME charset seeing widespread
use...)

    What you see here is what is commonly referred to as ``JustSend8'',
which is the only thing non-MIME programs can do to pass non-ASCII data,
with the result that you pray it arrives intact.  Sometimes it doesn't.

    At the risk of distracting myself even more from the daily drudgery of
work, I will volunteer to receive your mail to verify that you are sending
it 8BITMIME, or to identify the machines which prevent this from
happening.  Both my mailbox hosts speak 8BITMIME properly, so you can
address a sample 8-bit mail message to <barryb@tuke.sk> or
<Barry+Pine@Radio.CZ>.

    This offer also goes for anyone else who thinks they have problems
with Pine and 8-bit mail, but please spare me from being fired for
unproductivity by first verifying your Pine is configured to negotiate
8-bit ESMTP, and that you are talking to 8.7 sendmail or equivalent.

    Even if I can get your mail with all 8 bits intact and cause everyone
else here to turn white as I switch the display font to a giant Cyrillic
font ;-) , this doesn't mean that all your recipients will.  As Vladimr
noted, you will probably want to modify your sendmail so that it delivers
to all .ru and .su machines with JustSend8 so others don't complain about
unreadable MIME, while I suggest you be conservative and follow the
8BITMIME spec when sending to other domains which are more likely to
suffer 8th-bit stripping.  But this is only a workaround for the real
solution which is to encourage as many people as possible to upgrade to an
8.7 sendmail or comparable MTA with 8BITMIME support.

    Upgrade to 3.92...

    In 3.92, if a message arrives in your mail such as this one, Pine will
see that it's both posted to Usenet and sent to you by mail, so it's
entirely appropriate to continue this meaningless debate in public should
you choose.  However, otherwise, if Pine cannot tell for sure that the
mail is also posted to news, it will assume it isn't.

    It's also a bit more clear when you choose to reply, because you will
be asked if you want to Reply to the author (the default if I remember),
or only Follow-up to news, or do Both (as a courtesy, for example, if, as
is the case in this country, incoming news is nine days delayed from the
time it is posted, sheesh, or if the news server manages to lose half the
articles it should have).

    Not necessarily -- if you aren't able to use 3.92 right away, go to
the headers, ^Kill the Newsgroups: header, and put the e-mail address in
the To: header.  Ugly if you don't have the e-mail address handy, I guess,
but still 3.92 is worth the upgrade to eliminate this need.

    Never?  A bit strong.  I can think of times you might, such as in
response to this message which is both mailed and posted to news, should
you reply to the e-mail copy before seeing the news copy...

    Not necessarily...  Here's a dot-forward file we got:
"|/usr/local/bin/filter -o /home/BoZo/.elm/filter-errors"
/usr/people/BoZo/archive/received

    The result is that for this user, ~/archive/received is a massive flat
mail file which the Berzerkeley drivers in Pine or IMAPd can read (albeit
much more slowly than an alternate format file).  The end result is that
the filter program decides how to deal with mail, but no matter what
happens to that mail as a result, we still have a copy which can be
retrieved for later reference.

One of my favorite things about pine was the way it put a "+" sign next to
my personal messages. I subscribe to four fairly high traffic mailing
lists, and it was nice when I was in a hurry to be able to go through my
inbox and read only my personal mail. I was dismayed to note that in the
new version of pine, this feature is no longer available. If there is a 
way to get it back, please let me know. Thanks.

Hi Eric,

	If you posted the above inbox=path statement exactly as you have it
listed in the configuration file, can you tell me, if spaces can exist in
the path statement. Under MS-DOS, which I'm using at home, version 5.0, the
space is considered to be an illegal character.

	Would not the PINE program just see the following:

inbox-path=C:\PROGRAM ?

You wrote:
inbox-path=C:\PROGRAM FILES\INTERNET ACCESSORIES\INBOX

	If Unix allows longer directory names, shouldn't you have an
underline character between PROGRAM_FILES and INTERNET_ACCESSORIES instead
of a space?

example:
inbox-path=C:\PROGRAM_FILES\INTERNET_ACCESSORIES\INBOX

	I am not familiar with Unix as I am with MS-DOS, but would not the
same rules apply for illegal characters in the path?

Sue,
The feature did not go away (i.e. it works fine for me.)
If you could send me the "From: " header line from one of your outgoing
messages, as it exists in your sent-mail folder, and the "To: " header
line from one of the messages that *should* have a "+" but doesn't, I
might be able to help.

Maybe my eyes are playing tricks.  But, I believe the screen refreshes it
twice when you send (CTRL-X) a message after composition.  On the second
refresh, you then get the prompt that the message has been sent.

Has anyone observed this problem?

    The newest Pine, 3.92, has a number of improvements with respect to
saving interrupted messages.  In your case, this Pine will checkpoint the
message you are composing every 200 keystrokes, so if your computer gets
seriously hosed, you can usually recover from the #pico... file.

    Normally a message under composition which somehow gets interrupted is
saved to an interrupted message folder, and then next time you restart
Pine, it will detect that such a message exists and prompt you whether you
want to continue composing the message.  This isn't foolproof, though.

    In spite of the best efforts of the Pine authors, I was in the process
of sending a composition when my 3.92 Pine got stuck (for reasons which
are now clear to me), and because Pine did not expect to get stuck at this
point, there were no checkpointed files and no way for me to recover the
message by normal means.

    What I've learned to do in cases where Pine has frozen on me at points
where I know I will not be able to recover my composition, is to kill the
Pine session with a signal that will cause it to create a core dump file.
Then I analyze this core file to try to recover as much of my composition
as possible.  Sometimes I have had success, and other times it hasn't been
so easy.  This is somewhat a last resort for me, but I've had to do it
more often than I like to think about.

    Ideally, when your inactive Pine is sent a signal, it will write the
interrupted mail file.  Perhaps someone else will know what signal you can
give this Pine session.  Then you cross your fingers and hope it works.
If you know you can get core dump files, then you can use this technique,
only if you are willing to do a lot of work to recover the message.

    However, the improvements in checkpointing and perhaps better signal
handling (the authors could say definitively) make it worth upgrading to
3.92, the solution to everything but acne....

Eric, Morton:
I'm not sure if this is a complete solution, but try putting quotes
around the DOS path name that has spaces in it.  Also note that even
if you succeed in accessing a local copy of the Unix-style mailbox,
PC-Pine can only open it READ-ONLY.

Also, the remote inbox-path spec is not correct for POP.
Drop the ".mailbox" or change that part to "inbox".

This would have been very much easier by making a symlink called 'pgpencrypt' 
to 'pgp' in /usr/local/bin. This way you can see the difference pretty easy 
too! So you have to include the following entries with desired parameters:

 	/usr/local/bin/pgp -fast _RECIPIENTS_
 	/usr/local/bin/pgpencrypt -feast _RECIPIENTS_

This way there is no need for quoted strings!

I recently bought a new (for me faster 14,400) modem...  It is a pleasure 
to use.  Being able to access things more quickly is great.  However I am 
having problems using PINE that I didn't have before...  It is just that 
when I type I am getting occasional problems with untyped characters 
showing up in the text...  and difficulty moving the cursor back and 
forth in the text... etc. etc.  It is very frustrating...   I even pulled 
this modem out (Zoltrix 14,4000 wanting to smash it with a hammer) and 
switched back to my 2400 one... but I have grown used to the speed of the 
faster one...  My question is the following...[ Are the problems that I 
am having related  to the modems higher speed...  Are modems more 
sensitive to line noise or glitches as they get faster (in the same way 
that faster cars are harder to control)...  And if that is the case can I 
somehow setup PINE to do its stuff at 2400 baud while allowing my other 
internet viewing to proceed at a faster pace?...

There is no "additional" file that gives Pine 3.89 the options
screen.  You can enable whatever options 3.89 had by directly
editing your ~/.pinerc file.

>Plus does anyone know the name of the file pine uses to generate an autoreply? 

Pine doesn't do auto-replies.  If procmail is installed on your
providers system, you can use procmail to filter you incoming
mail, generate auto-replies and a myriad of other things.  Use
"man procmailex" or "man 5 procmailex" to get more information
on procmail filtering.

I would recommend your talking with your provider to install
a newer version of Pine, perhaps 3.91 or 3.92, as well as a
mail filtering system.

Later,
Ashok

    You may want to break your text at around 70 characters, because not
everyone can see every word of your long lines.  On this subject, a new
feature of Pine lets you ^Justify the text to which you are responding and
it will reformat the quoted text to fit into short lines, more or less...
I didn't do it because I have an attitude and a point to make.  :-)

    If you compile disabling debugging, then you will never get the debug
files no matter how you start Pine.  This has caused me much hair loss
trying to figure out the source of problems that the debug files might
have been able to help -- until 3.92, the SGI Pines were compiled by
default with debugging disabled.

    Better, from a SysAdmin point of view, is to alias pine to pine -d0
(don't write debug files).  Then if one has need to make use of debug
files, there are two options --
Start pine as \pine (enables default debugging)...
another possibility is, which is undocumented but useful:  from the Main
menu screen, typing a number sets the debugging level to the number you
type.  So, if you want to reproduce a bug you've found and get detailed
information about what happens, go to the Main menu, type 9 (or similar),
and then recreate the bug.  The debug file will have the needed detail at
that point.

    These debug files are harmless, they are rotated so you have no more
than four at any given time, and they can be invaluable when you have
problems, so unless you really are short on diskspace, I suggest you not
recompile Pine to disable debugging.

Subject: ipop3d from imap distribution.  Is if a full implementation?
Date: 30 Mar 96 19:52:29 GMT
Message-Id: <ellis.828215549@gmi.edu>

Even though I think it is entirely reasonable to insist that people login to
the main terminal server on campus and run pine to receive email, more and
more of them want to be able to access their mail with pop3, using either
the win95 mail program, eudora, or netscape.  To that end I installed the
ipop[23]d's today.  When I try to access a test mailbox using ns2 for
solaris over a dialup network connection, and I have the "leave mail on
server" box checked on netscape, I get the following error message:

The POP3 server does not support UIDL, which netscape mail needs to
implement the "Leave on Server"....

If I turn off the option in netscape, pop wants to move all the mail to the
client machine.  I know imapd would work more the way I want it, but users
are not interested in running PC-Pine, they insist on the above apps.

Is netscape misreporting this deficiency in ipop3d, or do I need to find a
different pop daemon for my solaris mailhost.

Thank you for any information/insight.

Stew,
The imapd and ipop*d that are shipped with the Pine 3.92 (and earlier)
distributions are based on the version 3 c-client libraries, which
predate the recent addition of UIDL to the POP spec.

For POP UIDL support, you need the ipop*d stuff from:
  ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap-4.BETA.tar.Z

Not yet, but I expect there to be an IMAP driver for MAPI (and therefore
the Exchange client) sometime later this year.

This might be a too easy question, yet I can't figure it out.
A friend of mine uses VAX pine, and he can't open any folder.  So he 
can't even come into the INBOX.  It used to work well.  Before it was 
stucked, he sent an undeliverable message and got a talk message, which he 
couldn't answer, if these are related with the folder problem.
Any help?

I assume you hit ^O to postpone it... then, from the main menu, hit 
C)ompose, the Y)es to continue it and mail it away as you would any other 
mail...:)

What's the best command line arguments to use to start pine and have
it present me my list of news groups?  Note that I often have
multiple sessions of pine going, including one that's viewing my
inbox, so I want to make sure that whenever I open up a pine
session for news reading it does not access my inbox (or any other
folder) and lock it up and make it read only.

Thanks for any tips,
Nancy

I am looking for a script which I can include in my .login file
which will randomly choose a file out of a specified directory
and copy it over the current .signature file.  This would of course
create a new .signature file each time I logged in.

Is there such a script out there?  I know that some programs do it
automaticly but, I would like a general script that I can run
that will make it work for both my newsreader and mailreader.

Any help would be greatly appreciated,

Thanks,

How do I create additional folders for incoming mail, other than my main 
inbox. Specifically, I would like to create a separate folder for 
messages coming from high-volume mailing list.


Sorrry. This is probably a FAQ.  But I can't find the answer anywhere 
else, at least not in enough detail to figure out how to do it.

Also, I would greatly appreciate it if in addition to posting the message 
here you could privately e-mail it, as my newsgroup accesshas been 
severely spotty, up and down, in the last week.

Thanks in advance,

Package procmail from ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de will do what you
are asking for. Pine can work quite well with this.

Whoops ... guess I missed the deadline for Pine 3.92, but I just thought
of it now! 

I sent a group of attachments to a colleague that totalled about 2.5 MB,
and sending took just shy of forever ... would it be possible (if it
hasn't been done already) to make the sending of mail a thread so that the
UI can be free up? 

Should be a simple vfork() call, but I don't know how PINE was originally
designed.  DOS users can suffer their non-threading OS.  :)

Hi All,

	I would like to see PINE have a feature that allows the ability to
attach a Subject Line to use with the Address book entry.

	This feature would be useful for game players, like E-Mail Chess
game players to use the Compose command, which then entering their
opponent's nickname from the address book entry, it would automatically
fill in the Subject line, then the sender can tab down to the text area and
read the file uploaded to the board or freenet into the message area, then
the user can send the move off.

	Now to use the same Subject line, one can just type the subject in,
or find the previous move received from their opponent and use the reply
function. 

	Just a wish to make writing a reply in E-Mail games, faster. :)

In Pico I mark text starting with control-caret or maybe its control-6.
Nothing seems to happen; but when I move my cursor down, the text
gets highlighted a line at a time.  When I get to where I want to
finish, I hit control-k adn the highlighted text dissaperars.

In every case I've come across people having "Unix problems", the
fault is generally that they are using a PC with vt-100 emulation.
I looked long and hard for a vt-100 emulator that was easy to use
and bug-free.  For instance, most won't print out of Pico or Pine.
PC-VT is my DOS terminal program, you can get it from the Simtel 20
CD ROM set.

Thank you for your interest.
He is a real novice at pine.  I am a little older novice.
I don't know what AFS is, yet he uses a normal and typical system prompt.
I cannot find anything else wrong except these:
when I press "i" at the pine main menu screen, it does not change and say
"Folder Closed" and
after coming to all folder lists and placing the cursor on INBOX, when I 
press ENTER, it doesn't change and say "Folder Closed" and when I press 
"d" for delete, it doesn't work.

Tell me exactly what happens when he logs into his account.  Are they
running AFS on his system?  is he getting a different system prompt than
normal?  Besides no folder access, is there anything else that isn't
working the way it usually does?

In PC-Pine 3.92, I'm getting a "Can't create filename.lu" error every time
I try to access an addressbook named anything other than c:\pine\addrbook.
The files are being opened, but every time each user goes into pine, they
get error messages.

Here's an excerpt from a recent pinecrsh file:

- adrbk_open(C:\pine\addrbook) -
Address book addrbook (C:\pine\addrbook) opened with 19 items
- adrbk_open(f:\public\pine\groups) -
Can't create "f:\public\pine\groups.lu", change name of
  addrbook "f:\public\pine\groups" so that it doesn't have a "." in it.
  Using temp file for now.
trying tmpfile C:\WINDOWS\TEMP\a3a36877
Lookup file C:\WINDOWS\TEMP\a3a36877 doesn't exist, creating
C:\WINDOWS\TEMP\a3a36877 is not valid, rebuilding
Address book GROUPS (f:\public\pine\groups) opened with 25 items

Right now, I'm the only one in email.
Groups.lu doesn't already exist.
I have permission to write to that directory.
I've tried renaming it c:\groups, c:\addbook, groups, addbook.... always
the same error.
I can open the default addrbook as local or global, but can't open
anything else local or global, old or new, without that error.
This error didn't occur with 3.91.


Any ideas?

Excuse me, but I am in need of some help and you are my next step.  I have
two problems that are absolutely mind-boggling to me, maybe not to you,
but wanted to voice them and ask for some guidance.  First, and foremost,
how can I send a simple file via email from any given drive, such as a:,
b:, c:, and ect...  Second, unfortunately I haven't been able to send any 
email to this address "johnny-chittum@kh.com".  Is there anything you can 
do from your end to see what the mixup is.  If you can, please respond to 
my cloudy confusion.

Thanks,

Hi all, 

I am running LINUX with sendmail 8.6.2. Mail ist delivered via a PPP-link 
to my university. At the university my name is 
h9052993@asterix.wu-wien.ac.at (real), at home I am  mad@r2d2.. 
(virtual domain). 
Whenever I use pine, it composes the Sender: - field to mad@r2d2...
I have allready spent lots of time to persuade sendmail to masquerade as 
h9052993@asterix..., but pine always encloses the hardcoded adress (done 
in sendmail.cf, works with elm) and appends the virtual address. The 
result is Sender: "h9052993@asterix.wu-wien.ac.at <Markus K. Lenotti>" 
	mad@r2d2.wu-wien.ac.at 
which is complete rubbish.
Did already rtfm for pine, but didn't find the right config option.

Thanks in advance

Markus Lenotti

Once you find it (if it exits), please let me know...

Also, as a suggestion for future addition, PINE might be compatible with 
multiple signature files.  Even the allowance of specific signature files 
to specified addresses...  I use three signature files now: (1) for 
person-to-person (same site) E-Mail, (2) for person-to-person (off-site) 
E-Mail, and (3) for person-to-group (mailing list) messages...

I compiled and installed pine 3.92 on a Next Intel version 3.2 and am finding
that it operates significantly slower than 3.91 and it appears to be causing
my swap file to grow significantly.  

Any ideas?

Could it be you need to define "alt-addresses" in setup configuration?

I have an alias "jroyer", when I receive mail under the alias I see a
"+".  If I remove the alias from setup, I don't see the "+".

Note that if you add the alias, any already received messages won't 
adjust to show the "+".  BUT, if you delete and undelete the message
after changing setup, the "+" appears.
