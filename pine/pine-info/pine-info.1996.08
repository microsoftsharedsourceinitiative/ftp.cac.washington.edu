Subject: Check of Incoming Message Folders
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

After a have executed the following steps in Pine 3.92:

  - open an Incoming Message Folder other than INBOX and read a mail but
    leave others intact at status NEW;
  - open INBOX and read mail;
  - check the Incoming Message Folders with TAB;

then Pine is saying "No more incoming folders". I think Pine should go to
the Incoming Message Folder with the new mail messages.
Is this a bug?

[The following message I originally posted on my local ISP/BBS. You might]
[find it useful. The mail programs support POP3 also.                    ]

Howdy all,
It's been a couple of months and I never thought about posting an
update. I've been doing a lot of slip/ppp stuff on this here XT.
No need for Windows here. Once I get a VGA adapter then things get
better as I have no graphic web capabilities yet.

Packet Drivers:
   Quakeppp works fine.
     Uses Klos Technologies PPP drivers/software. Dialer/terminal
     program can connect via scripts or manually.
   Etherppp works fine too but it's a memory hog. Causes some programs
     to error out like PC-Pine and Minuet.
   Slipper/Cslipper work flawlessly. Need dialer program or terminal
     software to connect first.

Clients:
   Minuet. Integrated tools. Telnet, mail, gopher, ping, finger, news,
     web, ftp. Web does not support forms. Can't use News as it doesn't
     work on Stacker drive. Minuet is my main program for mail,
     gopher and ftp.
     Requires dial-up program. Companion UMSlip/phone package works
     fine. I use phone to load cslipper.
   Net-Tamer. Integrated tools. Telnet, mail, ping, web, news, ftp.
     Built-in PPP using scripts or dumb terminal mode.
     I'm using XT/286 version which does not support graphics/sound.
     Web leaves a lot to be desired. Reader module allows for offline
     newsgroup reading. My main program for usenet. You can download
     only subject headers so you can then pick which full messages to
     download for reading. Pretty cool.
     Three versions available:  386 (graphics, sound, fonts),
      XT/286, and Palmtop (no graphics/sound on last two).
     Latest versions at http://people.delphi.com/davidcolston/
   NCSA Telnet w/FTP. Very good package. Also includes whois, finger,
     rsh/rexec, etc.
   CUTCP Telnet w/FTP. Based on NCSA work. Includes printing utilities
     like lpr/lpq/etc.  TN3270 also.
   Trumpet. Cool nntp news reader. Not offline but windowing/menuing.
   DOSLynx. World Wide Web browser. Not a port of Unix Lynx. Too bad.
     Uses Borland Turbovision interface (like Minuet/Trumpet). Slow,
     buggy, crash prone. In alpha and doesn't seem to be supported.
   POPMail. Pre-Minuet. No longer supported. Incorporated into Minuet.
     Includes Webster module (not in Minuet). Includes telnet, finger,
     ping.
   PC-Gopher III. Pre-Minuet. No longer supported. Incorporated into
     Minuet. The version I use(d) is pretty fast with windows opening
     all over the place with no memory problems. Later version
     (1.1.x?) had major memory problems.
   NuPOP. POP mail. Based on Minnesota code (POPMail/PC-Gopher/Minuet).
     Telnet, ping, finger, and quite a few more. Will call external
     programs like Trumpet, html viewers, graphics viewers, etc.

Those are some of the cool programs that work (except DOSLynx).
Minuet, NuPOP, POPMail, PC-Gopher III, Trumpet, and DOSLynx use the
Borland Turbovision interface so they're full windowing/mouseable
programs.

Tried PC-Pine but couldn't get it to work. Probably since Annex
doesn't use the unix box/pine to receive mail anymore.
Experimenting with Yarn (usenet SOUP) offline reader but haven't got
it to work yet. Need the correct programs to import the packets.

The big wish list is for someone to actually port Lynx to dos, usable
on 8088/8086/80286.
Anyhind, I'm having fun.

Surely the control-W command to scan for text gives them what they want?

Although there is no Mac-Pine, there are some freeware POP3/IMAP
clients on the Internet.  Eudora-Lite is very popular.  POPMail
from U. of MN is also very good (my favorite).  You can find them
in the info-mac archive, or the U. MI archive.

Cheers!

Provided you know what you are looking for.  An extra option on the
Control-W command to enter a line number would be a nice addition though.

I've noticed this behaviour in 3.93, 3.94, and 3.95 as well.  If you check
a folder with new messages, it seems to be taken out of the new mail queue
until additional new messages appear in it.  Pine is probably using the
last accessed time on the file and not the newmail flags to make that
determination.

Sorry if I missed the answer to this from an earlier posting, but I
followed it till it left my server. I need to attach a large file to a
mail message so that it can be detached via ccMail. Pine works fine, but
metasend does not (puts it in the body of the message). The trouble is
that I want to automate the process and I don't know how to do it in
pine. I thought that I could kludge it using the -i or -I (which one?)
option, but I don't know how to encode new lines, so it puts everything
into the "To:" field.

Can anyone help with this? How do I embedded CR (CR doesn't work) in the
keystroke list?

I suspect that this is not a feature of pine, but of the newserver you
are posting through.  So you should raise the question to your local
news admin.

The "rule" is also generally considered a good one.  We don't want
lots of messages which quote entire articles and then say "I agree" or
something like that.

I should encourage you to rethink whether your posting is necessary or
in the best form.  If you decide it is, you can always pad as you do.

Thanks!  I copied the 3.95 pre-compiled binaries over what came with
Slackware 3.0 (v3.91 I think), but I got the source and as you can see it
works fine.  

The problem was that according to my ISP's startup instructions, they say
to just use interl.net as the domain name.  Problem is that the head of my
ISP is root@inter.net, so he wasn't too happy to get several replies
intended for me.  

Hopefully now, even with X-Sender/X-X-Sender being there, there will be a
1 in 1,000,000 chance of it happening again.  I changed my domainname to
fakename.inter.net too, just out of paranoia :)

Oh, and BTW, do you think that the quotes around your 'real name' actually
matter?  I've seen MANY posts with quotes, and just as many without.

Thanks,

  Jason

I'm running Pine 3.95 under Linux and I was wondering if anyone had ideas
for including a random fortune into messages that I compose.  I'd like
something similar to adding 'taglines' (a FidoNet thing...).

Maybe a script to add a fortune to the .signature file or something with
Pine's filtering?

In the PINE 3.95 (UX) configuration screen there is an option to allow uploads
via protocol (such as Zmodem) directly into the editor.

I've configured the upload to call "rz" which seems to be running, (the
command "rz: ready to receive  usr/pub/"tempfilename" appears) but the
upload never commences when I go to send via zmodem.

Is there anything that needs to be added to the "rz" command to get it to
commence?

Thank you,

I'm using an external Editor:  vim -c "$ | r! fortune -s" doesn't work,
because I can't use Quotes.  So I use "vim -s fort" and wrote the
vim-script fort:
:$^Mo--^[:r! fortune -s^M

I think, the sending filter is too late, because I want to see what I'm
sending.

	Well, I suppose I should have read the help instead of
guessing.  You could go to the config and put your cursor on the
quell...and hit "?" to get a full description...but an excerpt
shows:

         FEATURE: quell-user-lookup-in-passwd-file
 
This feature controls an aspect of Pine's Composer, and if needed, will
usually be set by your system manager in Pine's system-wide configuration
file. Specifically, if this feature is set, Pine will not attempt to look
in the system password file to find a Full Name for the entered address.
 
	Which is not what you wanted....

	I'm not sure why you'd want to send an email only to have it
rejected.  So, having it rejected before actually sending it seems
like a nice feature....

	But, why now try setting the SMTP host to the value of that
of the local system.  That may get you the funtion you desire.

I have two questions: one, how does one delete extra folders in the folder
directory?  Two:  how does one import text into PINE e-mail message so
that it is viewable by recipient?  Thanks.

Not POP3 itself, only Pine's handling of it.
POP3 requires that each message be retrieved individually, and
to remove a message from a POP3 server, a client needs to explicitly
issue the DELE command.

The .addressbook.lu file is used to speed up access to large
addressbooks.  The format has changed a few times, so Pine needs to
rebuild it when you change Pine versions.  Also, if Pine is unable to
write the .addressbook.lu file in the same directory as the
.addressbook file, it will write a temporary copy that is only kept
for the current session.  Check to see if there is some reason that
Pine cannot write your .addressbook.lu file...

   But the search command (^W), can be used in many cases, particularly when
   you're correcting typos, which tend to be unique.

it kicks back bad words. My question would be how can I check all the dirs

I have PCPine version 3.91 and when I try to send mail there is a message 
saying that something has failed. I'm not sure what has failed, but I 
think something is wring in my configuration.  The mail is sent, but not 
copied into my sentmail folder.

I also cannot get into my inbox through pine mail.  When I try to enter 
that folder it tells me that my sentmail folder is being reopened.

I think the root of my problem is that someone tampered with my 
configuration....Is there any way to reset my configuration to its 
default settings??

I have been having this problem with the most recent version since 3.93.
I have a call into Sun on this issue, and they are working through the
core dumps I generate using kadb.  How I found this was to access an
IMAP mailbox without using rsh ( {host:143}/var/mail/bent ) and the
system completely hangs.  Mouse is dead, doesn't respond to pings,
Control-C does not break.  It's completely dead.  I don't have this
problem using the Sparc version, so I'm wondering what's up with this.

Unfortunately, the core files show very little information, and we're
trying to figure out other ways to make sure enough info is in the
core dump.  This is a big pain.

Only when netscape's browser supports IMAP.  Netscape have announced plans
to support IMAP.

In the composer, use the Control-R (Read File) command and enter the
filename or use the file browser with Control-T.

Well, there are several ways to do this.  If you happen to be using tcsh
as your shell, you can type spell and press ESC followed by the ? key to
get tcsh to show you what the path to the command is.  This only works if
the command is in your path (which it obviously is).

Another way is to type 'where spell'.  I'm not sure under what conditions
this works, but it will probably show the executable and the man page
both.

If worse comes to worse, you can use the find command as such:

find / -name spell -print

The disadvantage is that it will search the entire file system and will
return errors for directories you don't have access to.

Bounce redirects a message to a specified address.  All the headers are kept,

yes, but not when compiler flames at you that there is err in your source
code at line 243.. yeah u can get to desired line using ^V ^C but go to
nevertheess would be better.

While I don't remember why, I got it to work by setting the
environment variable SPELL='spell +mywords', where mywords is a file
with my own special words.  I have the alternate speller field in pine
config unset.  I am using pine 3.94.

But not if you are using Pico to edit your C program, which the C compiler
has just spat back at you saying there was a syntax error on line 306.

There is are some more important distinctions between Forward and
Bounce...


1.  Alf sends a message to Bert.
    Bert thinks "I can't answer this, but Charles can".
    Bert bounces the message to Charles.
    Charles receives the messsage, which is marked as being from Alf
	(although the additional "Resent-From:" header lets him know that
	it cam by way of Bert).
    Charles hits "R" to reply, and the reply is directed straight back to
	Alf.

If Bert had used Forward instead of Bounce then Charles' reply would have
been directed to Bert instead of Alf.

Bounce is useful for "passing the buck"-type messages (where you are
relaying the received message on to someone else to deal with and respond
direct to the original enquirer).  For example, staff on a Help Desk can
find this useful when redirecting received queries on to the people
destined to answer the problem.

Forward is useful when you want to pass a message on "for information" or
prefaced with your own comments.


2.  Bounce sends the message on "as is": no ">" quote characters are
introduced, and you are not given a chance to modify the text.  Forward
quotes the included text and also lets you your own comments.

[I admit I haven't looked at these programs recently and this response is
from memory of (possibly now obsolete) versions, but...]

Eudora and Eudora Lite are indeed very well spoken of.  However they use
the POP protocol and, certainly when I last looked at Eudora, not the IMAP
protocol.  I seem to recall Steve Dorner once being quoted as saying that
it never would.  This is fine if you have access to a POP server as well
as an IMAP server, but not all sites offer both.

POPmail III, when I looked at it a year or so back, supported POP2, POP3
and IMAP.  However it used IMAP in what I tend to call "the brain-damaged
way", using it to _trasnfer_ your messages off the IMAP server and down to
your local hard disk.  This then can make life difficult if the machine is
shared.  Also if you are away from your machine and want to refer back to
a message now no longer on the mail server.

Your best bet is to look for an IMAP client that manipulates the mail
in-place on the mail server (using IMAP as it was designed for) like Pine
and PC-Pine do.  Both of my suggestions (Mail Drop and Mulberry) do this.

Cheers,

And what is the difference from forward?
The Resent-From and Resent-Date do not exist in a forwarded message?

Subject: Pine difficulties

How does one set up the environment variables (TERM, TERMCAP) for
running Pine?  I can view the demo that you have set up for 
test driving Pine, but when I try to view use my local version,
I cannot see the menu at the bottom, page scrolling does not work,
etc.  I have the same problem with using Pico.

My system is a SPARC running Sun4 (need Solaris support too).  I
telnet into the system and view mail from a Macintosh sometimes.


Thanks!

Correct.  None of the original message headers are used in the forwarded

Yes, this would be a nice addition indeed.

The great thing about Pine is that it comes with the sources, so I've
tried to implement the "goto line" feature as an option to the search
command. This is how it turned out:

Once you have pressed Ctrl-W, you can enter the number of the line you
want to go to at the "Search:" prompt. Then, instead of pressing Return
you can press Ctrl-N (as in Number) and Pico will use the text at the
prompt as the number of the line to go to. When text or a line number
smaller than 1 is entered, the goto action will be (silently) canceled.

The interface might be a little funny, but it kept the amount of code
changes to a minimum and it saved the user from having to press an extra
key. I've found that you can quickly get used to it. 

The number entered does not affect the text used in a previous search
action. This text continues to be stored for future searches. 

The result is attached to this message for you to take a look at. Both a
patch file and the entire changed pico/search.c (Unix compressed) were
included to make it easy (it was small enough). 

Two final notes:

- Please be aware that the source files are from Pico 2.9
  (the one that is also shipped with Pine 3.95).

- This patch only affects Pico and the composer part of Pine.
  It has NO effect on the search facilities in the mail viewer or
  in the on-line help (other code, but could be changed as well :-) )

I hope that you find this addition useful. Feedback is welcomed.

Kind regards,

- Richard Gering.

Subject: Re: DG/UX HELP!!!!!
Date: 1 Aug 1996 12:39:56 -0400

pine3.95 gets a wee bit closer to being compilable out-of-the-box on DG/UX
systems, at least on dg/ux m88k running 4.11.

The last patches appeared in the c-client distribution, but they added a
comment which blocked out the utime.h include!


To apply this patch, unzip and untar the pine distribution from
ftp.cac.washington.edu, then cd into pine3.95, and finally pipe this file
into patch (make sure to use the -p option.)

For example:

  zcat pine3.95.tar.gz | tar xvof -
  cd pine3.95
  cat thispatchfile | patch -p
  ./build d-g

*OR* if you lack the patch program, you can grab the edited files and
park them manually in place from ftp://hopi.dtcc.edu/pub/dgux/pine/
and place them in

   imap/ANSI/c-client/os_d-g.c
   pine/makefile.d-g
   pine/osdep/os-sv4.h

*OR* you can grab a compiled (for m88k) version of patch from
   ftp://hopi.dtcc.edu/pub/dgux/pine/patch
 and apply the patches below if you lack patch

When you are all done, simply "./build d-g" to hopefully get a successful
pine compile.

Note that this is tested with DG/UX 4.11 under 88k platform. The utime()
controversy still exists "unconditionally" for 88k boxes and can be set to
work the same weird way with intel boxes iff you #define _USEC_UTIME_FLAVOR,
which I did in this patch.  The symptom of this not working right will be
weird messages when quitting pine that the folder time was changed but no
changes were found (paraphrased greatly) and folder times of Dec 31, 1969

Hi,
    Can you please let me know how to configure my mailcap files if I have
one and how to access mime-type files? And how to change my name for the
local sys without sending a mail to the local sys. admin to change my
name? My name can't be changed even though I've changed the config setup.
Thanks.

It may not just be an issue of having /usr/ucb in the path.  LD_LIBRARY_PATH
may also be set to include /usr/ucblib early in the link.  Ideally a Solaris
2.x machine ought to be able to run all of its programs without having this
environment variable set at all.

Many text editors have limits to the number of bytes, lines, or the length
of lines they will handle.  If you load a very large newsrc file into one of
these, you will lose entries.  Pico is one such editor, as is true for
MicroEMACS, jove, vi.  Editors that I know that have extremely large limits
are GNU Emacs and joe.

Message-Id: <4tid7q$bt5@eram.esi.com.au>

How do you get PINE to decode attachments on the fly while it is saving them
with some appropriate filter depending on the Content-Type?

Specifically I am interested in UUENCODE'd or BinHex attachments.

I am not interested in the actual display - just the act of saving to disk,
be it a Save or Export.

Thanks - Damian.

I came across the same problem with some versions of Solaris. The fix
which worked for me was to upgrade to version 3.6 of the (Washington)
IMAP-2bis server.

            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

rarely-unused would make it widely-used :-)

Anyhow, Pine 3.9x does support pop3.  Simply use the following
syntax for your mail-folder on the pop3 server.

incoming-folders= POP3 Mail {pop3host.domain/pop3}

Pine FAQ's are found at:    http://www.washington.edu:1180/pine/faq/
The error message that you are getting could be because you do not have a
domain name set.  I use Unix and am not familiar with Solaris but I will try
to help..

At my main screen I type S(setup), C(config) then it is about the second
selection from the top (user-domain).  Select user-domain type A (add) and
then type in the domain part (right-hand side) of your return
address on outgoing email.

Hope this helps!

As a couple of people have pointed out, not every compiler gives a good
indication of the text surrounding the line(s) in error, so searching for
the text may be impossible since it's not indicated.  FORTRAN compilers
appear to be particularly bad about not saying on which line an error occurs,
based on the questions I've fielded from users.

There is yet another reason for wanting the `goto line' feature, though, and
that's pure simplicity.  Pico is, after all, designed to be simple to use.
Though many users could use the Control-W and search for text pointed out
by the compiler (if it does that kind of thing with errors),  I suspect many
would find that method to be needlessly difficult.  Given enough time, I
could probably come up with quite a few examples where even given the text
of the error message it takes several repititions of a text search to
find the desired instance of that text in the file (though your argument
that typos tend to be unique is a good one, it certainly isn't always the
case).  If you know the line number, it's just *much* simpler to be able to 
go directly to that line.

Again, I don't even use pico; the initial question I asked was on behalf of
the large number of pico-users that I support.  I was just hoping that my
inability to find the magic key sequence in pico to `goto-line' was just
ignorance of pico's capabilities on my part.

We've already seen one patch posted to this thread that implements the 
desired feature.  If it rains here this weekend I may come up with my own
patch to add the same feature, but with `Goto-line = ^N' listed as one of
the options right in the ^W menu, so it's no secret to the neophyte users.

Say you get a mail from user@foo.com that was intended for me. If you
forward it to me I'll get the mail as "From:
abe0084@InfoNET.st-johns.nf.ca". If you OTOH 'Bounce' that mail to me,
i will get it as "From: user@foo.com" and if I look into the headers
I'll see "By way of abe004@Info...".

Could be handy if I filter my mail based on the "From:" field

I did the same thing. First, know that PCPine, or at least the 32 bit version, 
does not support pipes. So, you need to make sure the filter rule includes
_TMPFILE_. Second, make sure you specify the explicit path to the program,
including extension. (ie: d:\win\pine\pgpfilt.bat). And last, you will need
to make a small change to the source. In the file os.c (which is created, I
believe from os_wnt.c), search for PIPE_RESET. (I am working from memory here.
I don't have the source in front of me...) There is an if statement, something
like:  if (mode && (PIPE_RESET | PIPE_READ | PIPE_WRITE))

Take the PIPE_RESET out of that line. And recompile.

I mailed this fix to the development team. If they like it, 3.96 should work
better.

Hi...

        All of a sudden, using pine, I'm receiving an error of:

[{mail.ki.net}inbox : Error creating
/var/mail/scrappy.lock.839102584.7566.quag]

        Nothing has changed that I can tell, it just started happening...

        I've checked permissions on directories...it let's me into my
mail properly, or so it seems, and can delete messages, but the
error message is disconcerting to myself, and to my users, to say the
least...

        Anybody have any ideas on what might have changed that I'm not
thinking of, that would cause this?

In pine 3.91 (and +) there is a feature in the configuration screen called
enable-full-header-cmd.  This allows you to type and H while in a message and
it will display the full route of the message along with other things.

    This is true, as far as it goes, but many people still do not have
MIME-complaint mailers, so they couldn't use MIME if it bit them on the
nose.  However, in some circumstances they *can* use straight 8-bit
transmission within a limited sphere, so that's what they use.

    I participate in a mailing list on languages whose server is in
Europe.  I have never had any problems sending or receiving 8-bit
characters (one I set my display hardware for ISO-8859-1).  Although
the listowner once made some noises about a MIME-compliant upgrade on
the server, it is still an 8-bit list for those who can handle 8-bit
and who are on 8-bit paths.

    MIME may be a standard, and Pine handles MIME, but a lot of the
world is still non-MIME, and we have to live with that.

Dear helper,

   I am a Unix's pine user.  Could someone solve the problem below for
   me?  Your help is appreciated.

   Each time I invoke pine, I got a warning message:
      The domain name is incomplete...
      The returned address in your outgoing mails may be incorrect...

   The return path in each of my outgoing mails is always yjd@machine
   where yjd is my userd id and machine is the name of the workstation
   where I am working.  Therefore, if my addressee replys me an email,
   he/she will fail.

   If you can help me, please don't reply this mail (because the
   returned path is wrong) but send your mail to yjd@cs.clemson.edu.
   Thanks.

Tony

Hasan, die Newsgroup, in die Du gepostet hast, ist rein Englisch-sprachig.
Ausserdem geht es hier um die Printer Sprache "Postscript". Du
solltest Dir passendere Newsgroups aussuchen, um Dir Freunde zu
suchen. Leute in den Newsgroups reagieren oft veraergert, wenn man
darin Themen anspricht, die mit der Newsgroups nichts zu tun haben.

Und Du solltest Dir eine Newsgroup erstmal gruendlich anschauen,
um ein Gefuehl dafuer zu bekommen, was darin gerne gesehen wird und
was nicht.

From what I have noticed is that the new versions will ask for the name of the
printer and then the print command.  What happens when you actually enter in a
printer name, instead of leaving it blank, when you go to print it will tell
you which printer you are printing to.  In other words if you entered in the
name Pthis for the lpr -Pthis the confing screen would look like this:

Printer list: "Pthis"		lpr -Pthis

and then when you go to print the print message will say:
message sent to printer Pthis.

Yes, Pine can read and write MH folders.  If your MH folders reside on
the local machine, go to the Setup/Config screen and configure

	inbox-path=#MHINBOX
	folder-collections=#MH/[]

You can also set these as system-wide defaults in your
/usr/local/lib/pine.conf file.  If you have sub-folders, you will need
to specify a separate collection for each sub-folder.  We are planning
to remove that limitation when we add hierarchy support to Pine 4.x.

OK ... when I attempt to give a short reply to a newsgroup message using
Pine3.95, I am sometimes not allowed to post because I am re-using more
lines from the previous email than I am adding of my own.  This is
moderately annoying, and encourages me to pad my reply with blank lines.

    Nothing simpler.  Before you send the message, put the curser on
the Fcc: line in the header and press ^K (Control-K).  This will blank
out the line and the message will not be saved.  I do it all the time
for tiny little acknowledgement messages that aren't worth keeping
copies of.

I see you're posting from a Unix host, specifically an SGI.  Is it safe
to assume you're doing this for test purposes, not something you'll need
a whole lot on every day?  If so, I'd recommend just using the Unix mail
utility.  Under IRIX 5.x (at least) this is /usr/sbin/Mail.

I suppose you can just E - Export the message, and then edit it in an 
editor when you exit Pine.

That is not too difficult.

I had a postponed message.  Just now I started continuing to write it.  
Then I think I pressed Control C.

There is no sign now of this message anywhere.  Gone!  Arhhh..#$!

Can I get it back?

If not, I really think Pine ought to be updated so that it would not destroy 
messages.

This message had already been saved to a message folder called postponed 
messages.

Sweet smell of great sorrow lies over the land,
Plumes of smoke rise, and merge into the leaden sky,
A man lies and dreams, of green fields and river,
But awakes to the morning, with no reason for waking.

He's haunted by the memory of a lost paradise,
In his youthful dream, he can't be precise,
He's chained forever, to a world thats departed,
It's not enough, it's not enough.

Mime-Version: 1.0

After upgrading to pine 3.95 everything was fine until the month changed
to August. Now pine asks me to delete old sent-mail folders _every_ time
I start pine, even if I told it no on all previous years sent mail month
by month on last pine startup. This tends to get at you when you have to
press 'N' some 100 times before you can enter pine to read some mail =)

Why does it want to delete sent mail at all? I have never deleted a
message I've sent so far, and the collection is not much over 40MB. Sent
mail is a good reference when old issues are brought up, or when you
wonder what was going on with this and that back then. 

Anyway, is there a switch to turn this "feature" off? I want to keep all
mail w/o going out and rename the sent-mail folders manually every month.

Thanks.

Hi, 

i got a problem installing an auto-respond to all incoming mails.
I got a account on a LINUX-Server and therefore I use UNIX-Pine (Version
3.90 (built Tue Aug 22 19:50:49 CDT 1995)). I will be on vacation for a
long time and don't want my e-mail-partners going crazy on not getting a
response from me. 
I would like to reply to all messages with a standard text telling them,
that i am on vacation and won't be able to respond to my mails.

Is there any possibility to do that with pine????

I would be very happy to hear from you soon.
Please do also respond to the following E-mail-Adress.

Thanks...

Thomas (Thomas.Binder@public.uni-augsburg.de)

Hit "h" to toggle between seeing all the headers and only seeing a
few.  You need to have "enable-full-header-cmd" on in your
configuration.

Hello Pine Team,

I am using PINE is a newsreader, and because I am famialiar enough with
the interface, it is working very well for me. There are some
news-oriented features I would like to request, however.

1) Be able to select messages based on a Text string in the newsgroup
field (this would allow me to select all messages cross-posted to any alt.
groups by searching for ALT in the newsgroups field. I could also select
all cross-posted messages by just selecting the ones with a comma in the
newsgroup field.

2)A kill user feature, that would allow me to automatically exclude all
messages from user X.  This way I could 'kill' the headhunters on
seattle.jobs.offered and also the really annoying guy on
rec.music.classical. I guess this could also apply to e-mail as well, so I
wouldn't have to read e-mail from my ex-girlfriend.

If you have any comments based on my suggestions, please e-mail me.

Thanks,

-Martin Cron

    Pine will not do this for you.  However, because LINUX is a variant
of Un*x, you may have the program 'vacation' on your system.  If you do,
it will do what you want in a simple way.  If the program 'procmail' is
installed, it is a powerful mail processing program which can do many
things, including make automatic responses more elaborately than
vacation.

There is probably a more direct way of doing this, but ...

If you set your smtp-host in your Setup Configuration to a machine
which doesn't know itself what users are on your machine (so it
will accept the message from Pine, but letter bounce when it tries
to pass it to your machine) you will get a real bounce message.

I'm sure that there are other ways, and this might not serve
your purpose depending on why you want to do what you want to do.

A little hint. For start do the following steps:

1) Delete win95
2) Install some free unix. Like Linux, or *BSD.
3) Ask the question again. (replaing the windows w/ your favourite unix
   system you are using)

I've been trying to set up pine and my IMAP server so that I can get read
mail securely using ssh. Here's what I've done

1. Removed rsh, and crearted a symlink: rsh -> ssh
2. Copied ~/.ssh/identity.pub to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys (I'm only trying
this locally until I can get it working.
3. ln -s /usr/sbin/imapd /etc/rimapd

When I start pine, it gets a successful connection (according to my
syslog). But for some reason pine closes the connection (the pine-debug
files don't even give an indication that an rsh connection was attempted) 
and goes through normal password authentication. Here is the relevant
output from sshd -d: 

debug: Received session key; encryption turned on.
debug: Attempting authentication for manojk.
debug: Trying rhosts with RSA host authentication for manojk
debug: RhostsRSA authentication failed for 'manojk', remote 'manojk', host
'chutney.ini.cmu.edu'.
log: RSA authentication for manojk accepted.
debug: Received request for X11 forwarding with auth spoofing.

debug: Received SIGCHLD.
debug: End of interactive session; stdin 0, stdout (read 97, sent 97),
stderr 379 bytes.
debug: Command exited with status 1.

Here is the initial output from 

rsh localhost exec /etc/rimapd:

Any ideas on how to fix this? Thanks for your help. Please e-mail your

I've had no problems with running pine or sending mail through it, but
could someone
tell me how to configure pine so it looks up my account on my ISP's mail
server?

Also, how would pine deal with the password required for the account?  I
wouldn't 
like anyone to be able to telnet to my computer and get my mail.

Thanks for any info in advance.

This is probably is simple question but...

Is there any way of sending a letter from regular PINE to a destination list
which is given as vlaid network addresses in an ASCII text or ASCII 
delimited format?

e.g.

jill@internic.net
jack@internic.net
guennivere@internic.net
etc.

Secondly, if this is not possible in regular PINE is there a batch mode 
PINE or some other batch program which would support this type of 
multi-sending.

Third where can I find the VMS/OPEN-VMS version of PINE?

Thanks in Advance,

Martin Green

Exactly how do you configure imapd to allow people to access mailing list 
archives?

I asked this once a while ago but I got no replies.  Apparently there are 
people who know how to do this. Could you share your wisdom with us?

Thanks,

Hi Pico and Pine users,
  I have been having problems with ASCII transfer (using a
terminal program such as Telix) and Pico. Whenever I transfer
an ASCII message into Pico, all the lines are jammed into 1
single line and Pico continually tries to "justify" the
message.
  Any one has the same experience?
  I tried transferring the ASCII message into Vi and the UNIX
prompt and there was no problem. Thus I think it isn't a
problem of CR/LF.
  The version of Pico I'm using is 2.5.
  I'll appreciate any help. Thanks in advance.

J. Tse

It would have helped if you had mentioned what version of Pine you are
using!

The old Pine 3.91 did indeed throw away your message if you cancelled it
(with ^C).

However later versions (possibly 3.92, certainly 3.93, current version is
3.95) usually write cancelled messages to a file called "dead.letter" in
your home directory just in case the cancellation was accidental.  PC-Pine
also, I presume, offers this functionality, although I don't know the name
of the file it uses.

If you are using Pine 3.93 or later and this isn't happening it has
probably been turned off in your preferences ... check your Setup
Configuration screen.

(In passing I presume you don't mean that Pine really did throw your
message away "just" by you typing ^C?  I suspect it then asked you whether
you _really_ wanted to cancel the message, to which you must have replied
"Y", before it did so.  However I admit it is unfortunate that most
keyboards have X and C next to each other (^X = send, ^C = cancel) :-)

Cheers,

Mike Brudenell                                         <pmb1@york.ac.uk>

I'd like to know if I can put a disk in my Mac and attach a file from the
disk to a mail message. If it is possible, how is it done? I need to send
something to a colleague and it is on another computer. We would both
prefer to not have to retype the file. It is quite long. Thanks for any
help you can give. Sandi

If you are having problems with line wrapping, you can turn it off with
the -w flag when you start pico.

You can't actually do this.. but you can get close - ie close enough that
replies will work, by setting reply-to to your real email address, this is
what I do, and it works fine for me. :)

	Yes.

	From the M(ain) menu of pine go to A(ddressbook) and type ?(help).
Then do a bit of reading.

	TMK, pine does not support a command line send.

	Don't know....but others may be more helpful on this matter.

I don't think so, myself. It already allows postponed messages (severl, if
you want) If you start composing and cancel, that's you decision. What
you're asking is for Pine to not delete a message when you ask it to
delete a message. You could always keep the prompting on. It ASKS you if
you really want to cancel the message and you must say "Y" to really
cancel it.

Right, and you took it FROM postponed messages to work on it some more.
Then you cancelled it. Pine acted correctly.

The properway to do this is if you go to a postponed msg. and then decide
not to write anything again, you postpone it again. ^O
Good Luck.

Subject: Locked folders


We are running Pine 3.90 on a Linux system.  Ithas been used as a dedicated mail
server without problem.

This past weekend we installed an NCSA Web Server unto the system.  The home
page offers the possibility of e-mail to our school.  This morning we find
that none of our users can open Pine folders in anything except read-only
mode.   Also the old UNIX mail program will not write the outgoing files
to the /tmp directory.  As near as I can tell the permissions look normal.

Any help would be apprpreciated.

Thank you.

Thanks for the info.  I had tried the +n command line option and it did work,
but I have users that know only pico as a Unix editor and need to be able to
move around in source files and make modifications (perhaps fixing errors
while trying to get something to compile).  If there are 10 errors on
various lines in a large file, it's a PITA to have to make a change, save
your change, quit pico, and then resart with some new +N linenumber to go
to the next error.  A number of users had asked if there was a better way.
Now I can tell them definitively, "Not with pico."

Notwithstanding your vi test, I think this is a problem with CR/LF...
(Not all programs operate with the same terminal driver modes.)

Try looking for a config option on your terminal program that permits
CRs to be sent without turning them into CR/LFs.

A partial solution would be to configure your pine with the
enable-full-header-cmd option turned on, and then press H when reading a
message.  Read the Received: headers from the bottom up to trace the
hosts through which the mail traveled.

If you really need to identify routers and gateways, the only tool of
which I know is traceroute.  It is not retrospective, however.

Please ignore the original message.  I tried to cancel it - without
success. What had happened was that the command in config about enabling
alternate editor had somehow become enabled - and that was what was
causing the problem.  (I did not enable it myself - so I don't know how it
got enabled... I thought it was a function of the newer version of Pine.)

To the real technical wizards of    comp.mail.pine 
may I present yet more information concerning my recent inability to post 
to any of the three sci.aeronautics.* newgroups, ONLY!!!

A sympthetic friend was able to confirm one's inability to post to
sci.aeronautics.airliners with the debug results below.

Remember, unix Pine 3.91 would post just fine to sci.aero... until about a 
month ago. One can capture all the news from these three groups normally.

I am creating a e-mail and then attaching a WP document with pine 3.94
and a salesman collects his e-mail with Procomm plus 3.00 on his P.C. 
In the new Procomm Plus there is a e-mail option in it now. The problem
is that when I detach the attachment, WP says invalid Document Format.
Is anyone using Procomm's e-mail package with Pine?

Internet standards are published what called "Draft" Request For Comments
(or RFC).  The principle RFC that describes internet mail headers is
RFC822, although this has been supplemented by later RFCs describing
MIME and other extensioins, everything is based on RFC822.

The actual set of headers is not really fixed.  A particular program
can support headers which are not in the standard.  For example, some
anonymous remailers support various headers like X-Anon-To:.  Well
behaved non-standard headers begin "X-" (as specified in RFC822),
but some systems use badly behaved non-standard headers.

You should be able to find the RFCs at a good internet archive near
you.

In the .pinerc file there is an option "speller" which you can
set to anything.  Now what I would like is alternative spellers
so that I can run either "ispell" or "ispell -d american" depending
on where the message is going.

This is not *strictly* about Pine, but can someone point me to a program
to read a mac disc in a dos drive? Preferably free!

How can I send a message again (which was sent but not answered). There is

->Just out of curiousity, on a good day how long does it take to open a folder
->with 9k messages in it?

:)

 Let see...Trying to open saved-messages.. it took about 1 min and 10
second, and it had around 10350 messages and load went up aprox to 0.16..
perhaps I should renice pine to -25 :)

But I gave up on using pine for anything else than looking inbox folders,
becuse if try open something a bit bigger I get "gifted" w/ something like
this (even if I close the folder pine does not give back what it once took)

19917 adam      33    0   26M   12M sleep   0:33  0.04%  0.03% pine

Cureently I use glimpse to look over my old mail very cool and fast and
pretty useful tool for searching texts of 100mb magnitude.

Well gotta quit pine to get its memory usage to sane limits.. but you can
try simple experiment, run 'top' at one window , and in other just try
open differnet folders using pine in another window, and you notice that
pine is eating more and more memory when you open consecutive folders, and
is never giving it back.

Sometimes i'm attaching large files (200-300KB) to my mail messages, which
i don't want to save to my sent-mail folder although i'd like to save the 
message itself. Is there some way to make Pine (i'm using 3.95 with Linux) 
save the sent mail without attachments? 
The only solution i had so far was to edit the sent-mail folder directly
with an editor like vi or emacs, but actually this is not very comfortable... 

                                             TIA, P. Seelig *8^)

	Hummm....two choices come to mind:

1.	Use b(ounce) and bounce the copy in the sent-mail folder.
	The one draw-back to this is bounce only accepts one receipient
	so if you have several Cc's you have to b(ounce) more than
	once if you also want to resent to the Cc's.

2.	Use f(oward) and forwar the copy from the sent-mail.  In this
	case you may want to edit the Subject: line to remove the (fwd)
	indication.  You may also find yourself editing the body to
	remove parts added by the forward function.

	Hope that helps....

Another choice is to save the msg from the sentmail folder into the
postponed-messages folder, then press 'C'...

Does anyone have knowledge of PINE development plans?  

Specifically, I would like to know whether there are plans to introduce
IMSP to pine.  I understand IMSP is a standard which will allow a client
user, running PC-PINE, say, to access files (addressbook) on the server,
much as IMAP permits manipulation of both remote and local folders. 


thanks,
mark

Adam,

It is a little difficult to figure out what happened.

Control C (for cancel) asks for confirmation.  Did you confirm that
you wanted the message cancelled?  Remember, ctrl-O is for postpone.

Also, version 3.95 (at least) writes the most recently cancelled message
into a file called deal.letter.  If you haven't cancelled anything since
it whould be there.

I really does make it hard for you to destroy messages, but cancelling,
confirming it has to believe you.  Even then it gives you a chance.

Minden jot,

Since the recent changes in Pine, I can't print my email anymore.  I don't
know if this is coincidence or something to do with the new changes.
Also, when I could print, I could only print what I see on the screen, not
the whole text.  Is there a way to print the whole email message, not just
what appears on the screen?  If anyone knows about either of my questions,
please write me at

Most implementations of malloc() do not give back memory.  Pine is giving
the space back, but that just causes more free space in the malloc() arena
and not reducing the process memory size.  This is all due to UNIX's need
to be compatible with the days when it ran on a 32K PDP-11...  ;-)

If you are going to use 20MB folders on a regular basis, I strongly
suggest that you look into converting to tenex format.  The standard UNIX
format requires that a completely in-memory snapshot be made of the entire
folder.  This is not the case with tenex format, and this results in
substantial savings.  The disadvantage with tenex format is that most
other mail programs don't recognize it.

IMSP has been re-designed and renamed ACAP (Application Configuration
Access Protocol).  We are currently planning to implement ACAP support
in Pine 4.x (it probably won't make 4.00 though).

I work in a public lab environment, and so I need to find a way 
to permanently turn the autosave feature off.  Does anyone know of a way 
of changing the program so that the users will not even have the option 
for this?

Subject: NEED A GOOD PPP PACKET DRIVER

SUBJECT  I am currently using EtherPPP with Minuet.  Due to the fact 
that EtherPPP requires some 126000 bytes of resident memory, this 
causes Minuet to crash regularly.  I cannot use the graphics option of 
the browser, only text, as using graphics will draw about one half of 
the first graphics page before it crashes the system.  Does anyone 
know of a good PPP packet driver that works with DOS?  No Windows, 
and no Novell network.  For pay OK.  I have written a dialer so the 
procedure could be just a packet driver with no dialing options.

PINE  Pine will not even load on my graphics monitor system with 
EtherPPP loaded.  I have to use a monochrome system where I can use 
the "A" bank for system memory, then Pine will run.

Easiest way is to open sent-mail and forward the message to the same
recipient. You have a chance to edit out all the forward stuff if you
want.

Just for the record, the patch posted DID have the goto feature mentioned
right in the ^W menu. The only "secret" was in the way the goto feature
worked, but an explanation of this was added to the context sensitive help
(^G). With this, even neophyte users should be able to figure it out.

When you get a new message and you're already IN Pine, is there a way to
get to that message without quitting and re-entering Pine?

When I send eamil to someone, my email address appears automatically 
in the header of my message, such as:
From: Qingchun Guo <guo@bull.gsfc.nasa.gov>

My question: Is there a way to make a different address appear here 
instead of my real address "guo@bull.gsfc.nasa.gov"?

The reason I ask this question:  I change my computer very often.  Each 
time I change my computer, my real email address changes.  Fortunately, 
I have a formal email address in my organization: 
Qingchun.Guo@gsfc.nasa.gov.
If my friends send a message to this formal address, my organization 
will automatically forward it to my real address.  So I want all my 
friends to use my formal address, not my real address.  But if my real
address appears in the header of my every message, my friends will use 
my real address instead of my formal address.  That's why I want to let 
my formal address appear in the header of my message, instead of my real 
address.

Is that possible?  Thank you for your help.

If you write to me, please use my formal address
(Qingchun.Guo@gsfc.nasa.gov).  Please do not use my real address that 
appears in the header of this article.

Thanks in advance!

Qingchun Guo

Bounce is like Forward, except:

   that were Forward included the forwarded message in the body of
   a new message, bounce resends the message itself.

   Forward will create a brand new set of headers for the message
   it sends (and include the old headers in the body of message),
   while bounce will reuse the original headers (including the
   to and the from), but will send the message to the person you
   specify.

   Bounce will add to the headers "Resent-to:" and "Resent-from:"

I usually use bounce when someone sends me mail that really should have
gone to someone else.  That way the real recipient can reply to the
message and the reply will go to the original sender.  However,
when I bounce a message to someone, I let them know (possibly via
a separate email message) that I am doing that.

I have also used bounce as a lazy way of moving mail from one
account to another.

Perhaps he doesn't have a new enough version of WordPerfect?

Have you tried hitting 'm' for main menu and then 'i' for incoming-message
folder?  It shouldn't be necessary to quit Pine entirely to get to your
new messages...

Hello all!  This question hasn't been asked in a while - but it was
asked this year, at least.  I never saw a final "reason," only a fix....
which works.  On a late night last week, my weakened brain tripped upon
the answer & I thought I'd share it...

I was getting the 'Incomplete maildomain "myhost."' error whenever I
started Pine 3.9x (3, I think) on my new Solaris 2.5 machine.  The same
software (Pine) had worked faultlessly for over a year on a similar
machine having Sol 2.4.  So, what's the difference?  Remember, I was
tired, but I vaguely remember that the /etc/hosts file is what made the
difference.  Pine gave the error whenever the machine name preceeded the
FQDN on its host line eg:
	123.45.678.9  mymachine mymachine.domain.name

But when I switch the two, Pine worked fine (without the change to the
pine.conf file):
	123.45.678.9  mymachine.domain.name mymachine

... seems Pine looks at the hosts file for its info - and only the first
entry at that.  Since "mymachine" isn't (obviously) a FQDN, it
complained.

BTW, for those of you moving to Solaris 2.5 from 2.4, I found that my
sendmail was handing out configuration errors to all who dared mail my
new machine.  seems it had found some kind of endless loop & was sending
mail to itself - and burped.  Turned out a change to my nsswitch.conf
file fixed that too.  Originally, the hosts line in there had "files
dns"  When I switch the order to "dns files" sendmail stopped
complaining.

FWIW,
take care
pj

You could also hit Control L while in Pine.  That will force Pine to do a
mail check.

I'd try the AIX Public Domain Software Library (aixpdslib) at UCLA.  You can 
http or ftp there at
	http://aixpdslib.seas.ucla.edu

They've got a wide variety of software; available as source or also 
pre-compiled binary.

( But if you get it pre-compiled, you miss all the real fun! )  

The instructions for compiling the source (at least for 3.2.5) is quite clear, 
and even for this novice, quite easy.

Go for it!

kls

However, as you'll see in the following message, there is a slight diffence of 
opinions:
-------------
Don't get the stuff from pdslib.  Get the 3.2 pre-compiled binaries at the
PINE home site.  They run fine on our R30  4.x box.  The source for 3.94
won't compile on 3.94 (at least not on our site).  However, get the 3.94
binaries, as earlier versions had many problems for us (check the archives
for my anguished cries...)

Sounds like a job for the "Reply-to:" header.

Subject: 3.95 freezes on broken imap ...
Date: 6 Aug 1996 12:49:50 -0600
Message-Id: <4u844e$564i@musca.unm.edu>

PINE 3.95
AIX 4.1.4
IRIX 5.3

Hello,

Our pine 3.95 indicate following issue:

pine 3.91 and before:
losing imap would only required the user to quit and start 
another session of pine. User did not lose the connection to 
client host which (s)he got on via telnet or xterm or whatever ...

pine 3.95 :
if imap connection to server is broken for whatever reason, 
my window session (telnet,xterm,etc,etc) is frozen ....


Can this be taken care of (i.e compile time flags)
or is this  a bug ... ?

Thanks,
hamjavar@unm.edu

The -P command line option (global pinerc file location) doesn't work for

When in the INDEX press ^L (CTRL L). This forces pine to check for new
mail.

Hello all,

A quick question: When I log into my shell account I usually get the "You
have new email" message.  I run pine and there are the new messages.
However, sometimes I sign on and the system just says "You have mail".
When I run pine I have new mail that I haven't read.  What is going on?
Has someone hacked my account?

Thanks in advance,
Stephen Horne

        I would very much appreciate some advice on how to Disable the
        Word Wrap in Pine/Pico.

        I am using the latest DOS version of Pine.

        I need to regularly email a very long and single string of
        characters which I have to insert on the first line in the body
        of the email message.

        This long line has one single SPACE - there are no other spaces
        in the rest of line. Ideally I want to send a long single line
        string which contains over 2000 characters - however if this is
        not possible then a string of a few 100 characters would be OK.

        I have been advised that I can do this by typing "pico -w"
        at the $ prompt. Then Ctrl/R to merge in my long string. Then
        save. Then when sending the actual email; Ctrl/R to merge the
        saved file into the body of the text. However, this does not
        work as the line breaks at the SPACE and the rest of the long
        string then drops down onto the second line. I have even tried
        typing the long string in Pico manually but this does not work
        either.

        Just so you know why I need to do this - I am based in Thailand
        and Email our company newsletter to over 300 customers each day
        who have subscribed to our list. However, E-Mail from Thailand
        is very expensive. Therefore, we have set up another email
        account in another country. This 2nd provider does not charge
        for email. They have a 'real to' or email forwarding feature.

        So I can send just ONE email from Thailand to this 2nd provider
        which contains all 300 Email addresses for forwarding. However,
        this has some limitations as the 300 addresses have to be sent
        as described above in a single line string;

        The actual command line is;

        Real-Bcc: "email address 1","email address 2", etc etc

        I hope this rather long winded explanation fully explains my
        question. If anyone can help please give me step by step
        instructions as I am very new to Pine.

        Thanks in anticipation.

I asked for help the other day because I couldn't print off my Pine
connections.  I can do it now.  Is there anyone who can tell me how to
print the whole message, not just the screen I'm looking at?  Also,
somehow all my email is going into a "read only" folder which can't be
deleted.  What can I do about that?  Please advise.  Thanks,
dlangen@makani.k12.hi.us

Hi... and HELP!!!!!

We need to allow export of files only from the users area( eg. not allow
them to do a ^R and mail the /etc/passwd file to themselves :-) ) 
We have the source for pine 3.95. We are running Linux 1.2.1.

We tried using pico as an alternate editor(use-alt-editor-imp9licitly,
always-use-alt-editor features). We invoked Pico with the -o option.
But we faced the following problem.....
While returning to the main screen(from where we actually send the
mail) we had to save the file. This file could not be opened for sending
and could only be sent as an attachment, which is not the normal
procedure.
Is there something we are missing out? Or are we going wrong somewhere?

We also tried to modify the source.... But we didn't know where exactly to
make the changes. Could someone please point out where the changes are to
be made?

We are extremely rushed for time..... and would really appreciate a quick
reply....

Thanx in advance.

I'm trying to set the nntp server on a VMS installation of pine (on sol.yorku.ca) and it 
keeps telling me in the folder list that there's no such host.  Now I know that this is 
an active news host because I can use it from other sites on the yorku.ca domain.  I 
also know that Sol can connect to the host because when I try to telnet there, the 
connection completes before it is refused.  Now I know that VMS has some conventions 
about naming external address, such as prefixing email addresses with in%", etc.  Is 
there some convention like this at work here?  Do I need {} brackets around something?  
do I need to change the collection location?  I'm running out of ideas. . . 

Thanks,

Eric

I have faced similar problems (^C instead of ^X). Even if Pine does not
store the message, most probably a copy of the editor buffer will be there
in your home directory (I am assuming you are using UNIX). If you are
using the default - Pico- this file is #pico... something like that.

Hope this helps

 Aim: To create a "new" business the Virtual Consumers Club or V.C.C. which is 
a virtual storefront on what is commonly referred to as the information 
superhighway. It will be supported by the infrastructure of an existing 
"suitable" company such as U.C.C. V.C.C. will have distinct advantages over 
competitors. Profit will derive from a membership fee, not on profit margin, 
which is the way that most other virtual storefronts generate income. 
Operating costs will be minimal (without the overhead of the traditional 
storefront), and most important, there will be complete access to the world 
market without geographic, legal, or political barriers. These features in 
conjunction with innovative marketing strategies, should allow V.C.C., to 
quickly overcome its competition and become a world leader in its field. 

Background on Interactive Marketing Technologies 

Over the past several years new businesses that involve a small amount of 
interactive marketing have appeared. Some of the larger names are The Home 
Shopping Network and QVC (recently purchased by the Home shopping Network). 
Their primary medium for conducting business is through the use of television 
infomercials. This has been extraordinarily successful, to the point that the 
industry is now worth over five billion dollars. While this new interactive 
medium for conducting business has several serious advantages to traditional 
storefronts, it still has some drawbacks. One of the drawbacks being 
uni-directional communication. Customers cannot ask questions, causing them to 
feel helpless and as a result many "hits" do not "bite". Another drawback is 
that customers cannot choose what they would like to view, they must observe 
what is being displayed. This is the primary factor that renders the 
television medium useless for V.C.C.'s interactive marketing strategy

Introduction: The Virtual Storefront 

The interactive medium described above would do almost nothing for V.C.C. 
There is, however, a new interactive medium and it is developing at an 
exponential rate, most importantly it is already available for V.C.C.'s use. 
It is potentially the most prolific medium for conducting business, and as you 
might have guessed already dominated by speculators from the  Home Shopping 
Network. The greatest advantage to this medium is that it is bi-directional, 
making if the perfect medium for V.C.C. to reach the world.
The new medium is called the World Wide Web. The World Wide Web makes the 
traditional storefront obsolete. It is based upon a network of computers that 
operate around the world all the time and has grown at an exponential rate 
since its conception three years ago. When lumped together the distinct 
aspects of the internet are sometimes referred to as the information 
superhighway.

What Can the World Wide Web Do for V.C.C. ? 

Anyone with a computer can "log in" to the internet for the price of a local 
phone call anywhere in the world. Once they "log in" the customer merely types 
an address into a "dialog box" and hits the enter key. This brings the 
customer to the business interface of the company with which they desire to 
conduct business. At this point the customer can point and click with their 
mouse and view different products, actually listen to how they sound, and see 
how they look in better than photographic quality resolution. Then they can 
place an order instantaneously with their major credit card. That's it! If 
they have any questions they can merely click on a "button" with their mouse 
to start a conversation with a help assistant. The customer can do this any 
time of day, anywhere in the world, and do it all instantaneously. Setting up 
a "virtual storefront" costs a fraction of what its conventional counterpart 
costs, and with this investment comes access to the entire world market. Many 
internet enthusiasts speculate the conventional storefront and retail store 
will be all but obsolete in five to ten years. It may take a decade for this 
to happen because thus far there is no effective marketing strategy that will 
"open up" the virtual internet business interface sooner.

The Competition 

The largest virtual storefront in existence today is call the Internet 
Shopping Network. They are owned and operated by the Home Shopping Network. 
Their Chief Executive Marketing Manager, told me recently that any marketing 
strategy that would reduce his profit margin would not be feasible because his 
company operates on minimal margins. I found this "situation" to be true of 
all the firms that are currently major players in the virtual market.
I then decided that I would have to locate a company that possessed a highly 
developed infrastructure in terms of suppliers. One that offered a wide array 
of products, and also required minimal modifications to adapt to V.C.C.'s 
"virtual storefront". I located and researched a few different possibilities.

Why Not a Conventional "Virtual Business"? 

We decided not to go with a conventional virtual business because of the 
competitive difficulties. Right now the world wide web, which is the platform 
for running a virtual storefront is developing very quickly. This will lead 
many companies to "set up shop" and "fight it out" for market share. V.C.C. 
will sit strategically in a place all its own because of lower product price 
and novel marketing strategies.

Marketing strategy: How will V.C.C. beat the Competition? 

Running a company that does not make its money on profit margin, opens many 
new doors in terms of marketing. I have developed three distinct marketing 
strategies that when implemented will allow to V.C.C. realistically become a 
major player in the market within three to six months. Furthermore, these 
marketing strategies will "open up" the cyberspace business interface 
prematurely, with V.C.C. in the lead.

Direct Marketing Strategy 

We aim to direct market the virtual storefront through the use of diskettes 
which would be distributed free of charge to the many customers identified as 
being most interested in using the new sales method. When inserted into the 
customers computer the program on the diskette will take them on a "Virtual 
Tour" of V.C.C. Diskettes are an inexpensive form of direct marketing with 
serious ROI. Look at Prodigy and America on Line. This method of advertising 
is the only reason that they are still in business.

Incentive Based Marketing Strategy 

We Plan to give incentives such as reduced membership fees to students and 
faculty at major educational centers throughout the world, as long as those 
schools agree to position our franchise in their "visit" list. A visit list is 
a quick access list of sites to visit on the world wide web. Once a site is 
positioned on a quicklist, even the most inexperienced users can access it. It 
is important to note that students and educational institutions currently have 
free and easy access to the World Wide Web.

Franchising Marketing Strategy 

Not everybody has access to a computer today. Our franchising department will 
target those who cannot afford to purchase or just do not want to be bothered 
by purchasing and setting up their own computer. Franchises can be set up 
anywhere because V.C.C will be controlled from a central location. Since 
V.C.C. franchises will be controlled from a centralized location, the cost of 
a V.C.C. franchise is much lower than our conventional counterpart (only the 
price of an internet connection and a computer lab). Therefore V.C.C. 
franchisees will have an absolute advantage over their potential competitors, 
V.C.C also benefits from this advantage. The startup cost of a V.C.C. 
franchise is approximately $30.000, while its conventional counterpart's 
startup cost ranges from 100,000 to 118,500. This 70 to 88 thousand dollar 
difference in the cost of a franchise will give V.C.C. another advantage over 
its competitors.

More Compteition 

U.C.C. is the ideal candidate for V.C.C.'s purposes. U.C.C. is headquartered 
in Indiana. They are listed in the Million Dollar Directory as a private 
company, having one subsidiary known as the United Consumers Club Franchising. 
They have Sec Codes placing them in the mail order catalogue industry. The 
most interesting thing about the company is the way in which they make their 
profit. They do not make it on profit margin, but rather on a membership fee. 
After paying a one time membership fee, members are entitled to purchase all 
goods at cost for a year. The members can save thousands of dollars per year. 
The idea is simple: What would have been put into the pockets of the retail 
stores is instead put back into the pockets of the end consumers. Or as the 
founder James L. Gagen says "everybody wins" both the consumer, and the 
company. Eventually, U.C.C. got into the business of franchising. United 
Consumers Club made approximately 11 million dollars from the franchising 
corporation compared to 74 million from the parent company. Therefore, the 
industry is operating at roughly a hundred million dollars. As of yet there 
are no major competitors in UCC's field. One of the benefits of partnering 
with U.C.C. is that the merchandise is of high quality and customers get 
access to a complete line of manufactures goods. U.C.C.'s profit comes only 
from the membership fee, thus there is no incentive to sell inferior goods 
unlike Sam's Club which generates income from goods as well as a membership 
fee.

Some Other Projects.......

Contributions to Mail Services and Company from BD, your a good man BD. 

Mail Services and Company: Maximizing Case "A"

This is an interesting project, Basicly it revolves around Domain Names. For 
instance if your name is Stan and you are an automobile dealer, then you might 
want your e-mail address to be stan@automobiledealers.com Cool huh, So if you 
are the company that owns the rights to automobiledealers.com,then you can 
offer a service providing e-mail accounts for people in that industry. Also 
Domain names are the television stations of tomorrow. If you want to watch 
science fiction, you will probably turn you browser on www.sciencefiction.com, 
this will take you to the domain science fiction, based around the subject 
domain sciencefiction. Just as if you want to get todaysnews, you might http 
todaysnews.com, or if you want to listen to rock music, you might http 
classicrock, modernrock, or alternative rock based on your music preferences. 
This company will revolve around leasing domains from the internic based on 
the subject, then leasing them to people interested. 
Note: Registering some domains is a good way to start up a "small" business.

The Alternic. Minimizing Case "A"

Speaking of domians and dns and all of that good stuff. The internic is 
currently offering dns service for 100 dollars for the first two years and $50 
a year after that. To my knowledge they are registering about 10,000 a day. 
Times $100 a domain that isn't bad. This number is only going to increase. 
They are only offering dns service on a few extensions, like .com, .net, .org, 
etc. If you have a few bucks to invest I would recommend starting your own 
Alternic, offering domains that support special characters and multiple 
languages. In order for a domain to exist, it only has to have service 
provided for it. Providing dns is basicly spreading out fixed costs, and the 
product only exists in cyberspace. So there is a large gap in the cost/profit 
ratio. Some good ideas to provide dns on are taxicabs . with no extension, and 
of course multiple languages, to the best of my knowledge we don't live in a 
one language world. Also the .fam extension might be populair really soon 
because people will want to throw out their mail boxes. If I were a University 
trying to raise capitol to minimize educational costs I would go into this 
business. Students can run it. And after all it is an investment in the 
future.
The Govenrment will not like this, first because it will kill all profit 
margin for the internic registration services and open them up to a global 
economy competeing world wide prematuraly in their eyes. They have one major 
way to prevent this, which can also be prevented. This is to create dns 
jammers that jam all domains not registered with their "legitimate" 
registration services. There can only be a one domain of each kind matched up 
to each ip address world wide. So if they provide jamming services this will 
jam the "illegitimate" domains right off the network with a flood stream. It 
is important for people to design web browsers that filter out these jamming 
services, that will seriously reduce their impact and comprimise their upper 
case "A" abilities. Currently all domain are matched to an ip address. This 
actually maximizes profit even more because they charge companies for an ip 
address eventually this will be you telephone number as well. These ip address 
go like this 255.255.255.255 why they don't go to 999.999.999.999 is obviously 
to maximize profit by reducing the supply even more. Anything is possible and 
999.999.999.999 ip addresses are definitly a possibility. A company or 
schoolastic organizatoin merely has to develop software that will support 
this, and distribute it to then begin providing services on it. Interesting 
huh???? Another way around this is to make ip addresses alphanumeric to begin 
with, then that will eliminate the need for ip addresses to begin with. There 
are some other designs around this concept, let me know if you have millions 
to blow and want to sink the next biggest ship. 

my bigger nightmares, I think Phillip Zimmerman might agree............
It is possible to filter all e-mail and information through high speed filters 
that search for key information, because all data transfers pretty much go 
through the nick to begin with. The direct system overides the primary level 
of central control. 10 years from now data security isn't going to be what we 
think it is today, and if we are living in a placeblo to begin with, we don't 
have anything now. 

Taking out telecommunications and Cybercommunications (cybercomm) profit. 

Everyone has heard of the iphone right. Thats a package that costs about 100 
dollars to buy and lets you talk for free all over the world through the net. 
Being as ip addresses and domain names are the telephone numbers of the 
future, there is going to be serous amounts of profit by selling these 
packages.
Some of them work through the irc proticol and other proticols. The telephone 
companys want to make it so that every thing has to be standardized, 
eliminating a strategy that I have developed that will kill profit for 
telecommunications world wide. This is to make all packages free to end 
consumers, and make them compatable with let say for example windows NT 
plugins that act as the telecommunications server between two of the end 
consumer client applications. This will kill all profit for AT$T in terms of 
selling the client applications. It will also limit their ability to make you 
use their services as the relay server, because you can use a relay server all 
the way accross the world if you want to. Seriously increasing competition 
world wide. This is good for us the end consumers. If they still compalain 
that their stuff isn't compatable, then here you go. All the client apps will 
be standardized to receive calls. That way you can initiate a call with any 
server company and still have it completely compatable. This strategy will 
seriously decrease global communications costs and allow anyone to start a 
"mom and pop" business providing services. I reccomend educational 
universities provide these services to offset educational costs. 

Reducing Software Companies Profit world wide, minimizing software costs to 
everyone and putting more in the pocket of software designers.

This entails souping up an os like Linux to be a shell like windows Nt or 95 
or system 7, porting it to every platform and then setting up standards that 
software developers can conform to to make everything very compatable. Next 
software developers must form development guilds that are centralized around a 
co-op development type system. This will allow them to design software around 
their public domain oses. They can also charge much less to register the 
software, and becuase they have a serious direct interest in the "company" 
they will make the money that they are entitled to instead of being "forced" 
to give it up in the interest of the company they developed it for. 

NtP

You know you computer will be your tv soon. NTP (negeotiation transfer 
proticol might be the start) If anyone wants to design it let me know. 
Basicly you client automatically negotiates with the server root domain of a 
domain. That way if the domain is a ftp site it automatically default to the 
ftp proticol. And if the site you access by merely typing the domain name in 
the box is a tv station, then it automatically defaults to the video stream 
transfer proticol. Cool Huh????

The first time I compose a message each session (or actually the
first time Pine needs to use the global address book), I get
a warning that I cannot write in the directory which contains
the global address book .lu file, and then there is a substantial
wait.

Why is pine trying to write in that directory?  I believe that
the .lu file is up to date.

When I do the following in the command line from pine 3.94 or 3.95
   pine login@host
pine comes up in function key mode.  This did not happen in 3.91.  Is
there something that can be set in pine.conf or command line flag to
make this not happen.  We have several scripts that get launched this way.
This happens with both sunos and solaris versions.

Ah hah!  I haven't rebuilt the .lu file after installing 3.95.  So
that it is.  I should have thought of that.  Thanks.

Presumably you are mistaken in your belief: hence why Pine is trying to
rebuild the file.  (Note that the format used in the .lu file changed
between Pine 3.91 and 3.93, and may have changed again to 3.95 (I don't
know as I have installed the latter yet)).

Get the person who looks after the global addressbook to update the .lu
file (using the "pine -create_lu" command: its options are described in
the man page for Pine).

I had a similar problem when switching between different versions of Pine. 
If multiple people access the same addressbooks with different versions,
the .lu files will get rewritten.  No good solution I found.

After weeks ago I got this effect, but MY .lu was NOT ok. I remember (?) that
I found the actual .lu file built by pine in the /tmp directory. After
copying onto the normal .lu file: All ok.

Hi!

The problem seems to appear in Pine 3.95 (probably, it is I first noted it
there ;)

If I try to select new newsgroups using ;SN, I always get *all* available
newsgroups selected, irrespectively of the status shown.

The TAB works corectly and jumps to the next article, marked as NEW.

Is it known problem?

greetings

There is a solution, providing that when you build a particular version of
Pine you modify the string which contains the name of the global
configuration files.  These are usually "pine.conf" and "pine.conf.fixed".
However I modify these strings to include the version number of Pine: for
example "pine.conf-3.91" and "pine.conf.fixed-3.91".

This then allows you to have different configuration files for each
version of the Pine binary you have in use on your system: quite useful as
newer releases often have new features (which admittedly the old version
would probably just ignore) which you want to test out before inflicting
(sorry! RELEASING) them on your users.

You can then modify the systemwide global addressbooks listed in each
configuration file so that the different versions of Pine access separate
global addressbook files (and hence their associated lookup files).

A cunning trick is to use UNIX's "ln" command to link the address book
files themselves together so that it is only one file, but accessed
through two or more names.  This eases keeping the data in step, and you
then just have to remember to recreate the associated .lu file for each
name by which the data file is known.

Of course this only helps with global address books specified in the
systemwide configuration file(s); it doesn't help people who have them
listed explicitly in their personal (.pinerc) preference files.  However
the thought may be of use to some...

Cheers,

Where are you trying to do this?  When I do to my newsgroup listing (L
from the Main Menu and then down to the newsgroups) and enter ";" I
get 
   [Command ";" not defined for this screen. Use ? for help]
Same for 's' and 'n'

I've got the enable-aggregate-commands set turned ON (and works inside
folders).  What's the option to turn this on?

Thanks

I am doing it when I am already in newsgroup. It looks, like you are
trying to do it when selecting newsgroup.

Oh, sorry, just noticed. Of course, it should be *articles*, not
*newsgroups*. I just used wrong word :< Thanks for pointing it out.

but the problem is still there.

Mike,

Your suggestion of adding <BASE HREF="http://www.cac.washington.edu"> to
the <HEAD></HEAD> part of to the saved archive search results page is
indeed an elegant solution.  

Generating the "BASE" line directly in the output page is, unfortunately,
not quite practical, since the HTMLized archives are actually generated on
another server (i.e., with another base URL than
"http://www.cac.washington.edu") here at the UW before they are copied to
the "public" server nightly and where they are "tested". 

However, the search results page now shows the date and time the search was
conducted, so when saved to a local file, it will be evident how up-to-date
those results are.

# A simpler solution is to edit the downloaded file and, in the

#

Um.  It still doesn't work.  Is there some tool I can use to
check the consistance of a .lu file?

True, but that's not to say that a program can't give back memory to the OS,
really.  The old way was with sbrk(); the new way appears to be with mmap()
and munmap().  I haven't looked at the code, but it's possible in theory 
( :-) ) to make pine act more responsibly with regard to memory use.

Find one of the folders that's displaying the `read-only' problem, and peek
through the folder with a program (less, od -c) that will let you view out
of band characters.  See if there are out-of-band characters in the headers,
especially immediately preceding the `From '.

If there are out-of-band characters in the headers, delete them with an
editor that can handle them, and then try reading the mail with pine and see
if it fixes the problem.

Now that we know we are talking about "articles", and not
"newsgroups".....

I tried this with 3.95 and it worked just fine. 

2 questions:  

1) Do the articles have ANY mark next to them (important/answered/etc) 
when you try to select them based on being "NEW"?

2) what's your OS information & etc?

I'm using 3.95 on NeXTStep 3.2 (m68k)

    Pine does not implement killfiles for either news or mail,
unfortunately.  I have no information for you for PCPine.  For Pine
under Un*x, procmail or filter can handle mail killing, and I just
learned a method for batch-mode-type news killing if your system also
has trn (preferably a fairly recent version).  The lack of killfiles
seems to be one thing in particular that causes uses of other
newsreaders to think of Pine as "not a _real_ newsreader."

We've been experiencing the same sort of thing since we implemented 3.95,
but I'm not convinced this problem is coming from Pine at al. However,
consistently, there is an extra "F" in front of the "From" of the first
message in the inbox. Taking it out with an editor fixes the problem. But
why is it happening in the first place? beats me.

Can you not solve this by starting pine with the -P option to point to
differing pine.conf files? These files could contain reference to
differing addressbooks, each one accessed by groups of people using the
same versions of PINE?

Actually, we haven't gone to 3.95 on our general purpose hosts (they're
still using 3.91), and we've only seen this problem on our Digital Unix
hosts.  I sent some email to the osf-managers mailing list a couple months
ago and got lots of responses that other people were seeing the same thing.
Many people suspected problems with the POP daemon a lot of us use (qualcomm's
popper), but I've been able to verify that a lot of the people that get
the junk in the headers are *not* POP mail users.  With Digital Unix, it
appears the problem may be in /bin/mail, the local delivery agent.  I've not
been able to completely verify this, but many of us have narrowed the list
of possibilities to just that.

I have no idea what would be causing the problem on other systems, but it
could be something similar.

This is because the same routines are used for both SMTP and NNTP in that
version of Pine, and at the level that it issues that error message it
doesn't know whether it is SMTP or NNTP.

This will change in Pine 4.0.

Subject: sendmail Failure HELP!!! "ioctl system call"???
Date: Thu, 08 Aug 1996 03:39:42 GMT
Message-Id: <4uc1q1$q8t@nuke.csu.net>

I'm having trouble sending only certain people mail.  It's strange.  I
can send mail about 95% of the time just fine.  But there are a few
domains that seem to cause a problem: like prodigy.com and juno.com.
Anyway, what happens is when I send the message, IMMEDIATELY (not in a
second or two, but right away), MY system gives me a MAILER-DAEMON.
This makes me believe it's not the receiving host, but something wrong
with my system's configuration?  Does that sound right?

Here's what I get back in the MAILER-DAEMON message:

Date: Wed, 7 Aug 1996 23:08:09 -0700
From: Mail Delivery Subsystem <MAILER-DAEMON>
Subject: Returned mail: Host unknown
 
  --- The transcript of the session follows ---
421 juno.com.tcp... Deferred: A specified file does not support the
ioctl system call.
550 "John C. Doe" <jdoe@juno.com>... Host unknown: A specified file
does not support the ioctl system call.
  --- The unsent message follows ---

I'm on an AIX 3.2.5 machine.  Is there anything I can do to "fix" this
problem on my end?  Any help or information is greatly appreciated.

Dan

You can't.

This question has been asked and answered many times in this
newsgroup/mailing list over the past couple of weeks.  The answer is still
"Pine 3.95 does not support kill files for e-mail or news".

(Now shall we see how long it is before someone else asks again? :-)

Cheers,

Yes, articles are marked N for "NEW" ;) Do you have
'news-approximates-news-status' set?

I done simple test (it assumes news-approximates-news-status is set):

remove (or better move) your .newsrc;
open some newsgroup; all articles should be shown as "NEW"; 
delete some article in the middle;
quit and restart pine;
enter the same newsgroup again; now the articles older than deleted one
   won't be  marked as "NEW"
make ;SN - it sets X ("SELECTED") mark on *all* articles, even the "OLD"
   ones.

Well, I am using Pine 3.95 on SINIX-N and SINIX-L; it is SVR4 based
system; I compiled Pine using ./build sv4 without any changes (sorry; I
changed default folder format to tenex and rsh name - I wonder, where resh
comes from). On one system I used gcc 2.7.2, on other native compiler.
Both behave the same way.

The Ctrl-^ command in pico doesn't work when you are using a German
keyboard. ESC ESC ^ doesn't work either, probably due to a bug in pico.
However, you can use Ctrl-6 to set and unset a mark.

Maybe `.lu' stands for `lookup'.  I think it's used just to
speed up searching in the .addressbook.

Message-Id: <4u7lcg$tf@hdihp3.fzk.de>

We are working with PINE 3.91 on our UNIX-workstations and therefore
we have an IMAP-Mailserver, who is holding the mailboxes for the Users.
The Users can access their mailboxes via INBOX-PATH={mailserv}.

Now we are trying the same mechanism from VMS-workstations; there we have
implemented PINE 3.89; this works fine, when the mailbox is located local;
when we define INBOX-PATH={mailserv} (to reach the remote mailbox), we
get no connection from the VMS-Station to the mailserver.

Any ideas ??

with friendly regards

Is there no way to get the Unix versions of Pine to remember login ID and
passwords combinations for IMAP servers like PC-Pine does? In PC-Pine you
create a passwd.pwd file, surely there is something similar for the Unix
versions.

Instructions for setting up a pre-authenticated IMAP connection can be
found in the archives of the Pine-Info/comp.mail.pine
mailing-list/newsgroup.  This can be found (and searched) on the
World-Wide Web at:

This only works if the username is the same at both the domain
names.  The general solution is to ask your sys admin to compile
pine so that ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM is permitted.  I really think
that the default pine should ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM and sys admins
should have to set DISALLOW_CHANGING_FROM if they do not want their
users to do this.  Zillions of programs, including the ubiquitous
Navigator allow people to change the From line.

Date: 5 Aug 1996 21:09:26 -0700
Message-Id: <4u6ghm$mvd@crl3.crl.com>

I just tried pine (unix 3.95) yesterday on a non ANSI terminal (wyse 150)
and noticed that the arrow keys did not work in the main menu like
they do with ANSI type terminals.
Shouldn't it work?
Are the arrow keys hard coded or does it get the info from the curses library?
I've been using pine since var 3.91 and I just realized that's 
the first tim I tried it on a non ANSI terminal.

If you haven't yet come to the solution, try issueing
'*' and then 'N' when the answered message is positioned either
at "Index" or "ViewMsg" screen.

I am using PINE for reading news groups. But I don't success
to send a message to news group through PINE. I get an error message
about invalid Internet address or something like this - the message
is displayed for a short time only.
The problem doesn't happen when I use NETSCAPE.
Please, send your responses to my e-mail address.

EtherPPP would also crash it here too and I'm not using graphics.
Quakeppp from Klos always worked for me with Minuet and other clients.
It's available from Klos's web site at (I think) www.klos.com.
I haven't used quakeppp in awhile since finding cslipper due to lower
memory usage.
Warning: there's no docs with Quakeppp except one small text file.
Klos said you get docs if you register the software.

At pine configuration screen, find the "default-fcc" entry and change it
to "" (literally - 2 double quotes). It will set the file name to empty
one, and the Fcc field will appear empty by default/

Command 'H' (header view) toggles the headers on/off at the screen in
the "ViewMsg" mode. The initial "From " line will still remains unvisible
in any case, but if you use pine vintage 3.94 or greater, you can set your
configuration so as always to print this line.

Well, I have Yehavi's port of PINE for VMS set up at Glasgow, and
here's how the config looks for the news server, when I'm in the
configuration dialog:

news-collections       = <No Value Set: using *{nntp-server.gla.ac.uk/nntp}[]>

My .PINERC file contains this line:

nntp-server=nntp-server.gla.ac.uk

and this:

news-collections=

does that help?

(Of course you can't use that particular server yourself, but that's 
the principle).

Or perhaps Procomm's email package doesn't understand MIME?
Or perhaps there's something wrong with your encoding.  One
test you could do is to send yourself the WP attachment and
then detach it and open it up in WP.  If this works, then my
guess is that the problem is on the other system.

Good luck,

    What version of Pine are you running?  It makes a BIG difference. 
Versions 3.94 and 3.95 allow you to specify the prefix character in
your configuration file.  I don't recall just when this feature came 
in, although I know 3.91 did not have it.  If you are running an older
version which does not have the built-in capacity for setting the
quoting prefix character, I have a simple technique you can lift off
my WWW home page.

I'm running PINE 3.91, and it asks me every month.  To avoid answering lots
of prompts, occasionally I move sent-mail-jun-1996 to to-archive-1996/
subdirectory.  I cannot see the letters from within PINE, apparently no
change subdirectory for folder allowed, but I could always copy an archive
back into the parent directory for PINE perusal.

Pine and Wyse terminals.  [sigh]  Can we get this is a FAQ? ;-)

I'm not the expert on this, but since no one's answered you yet, I'll
give you the basics.  Yes, I believe pine "hard codes" the arrow keys
(someone please correct me if I'm wrong.)  It just has a "list" of
escape sequences that it knows are all arrow keys.

The problem with Wyse terminals is that the arrow keys send control
characters that Pine uses for other functions, such as ^K.  You can
compile Pine so that it uses the arrow keys, but then you lose those
functions.

Solutions?  Several.  One is to use the termcap to turn your terminal
into an ANSI terminal.  Sounds magical, huh?  I believe it uses the "is"
keyword.  Don't know the details.

The other is to reprogram the arrow keys before you go into pine and
reset them when you come out.  I've got a script to do that, but not on
me.  You'll have to wait til Monday for that.  (E-mail me if you want
it.  Oh, and the script is for Wyse 60 terminals, so you might have to
rewrite it.)

Sorry I'm short on specifics, but if you yell loud enough, the experts
will ccome out of the woodwork.  ;-)

You are not processing MX records.

   In /etc/sendmail.cf there is a line that contains the string #OK
   (That is Oscar Kilo, not ZERO KILO)  read the comments
   on the preceding dozen or so lines.   Then:

   what you want is is a line that says:

OK MX

   or

OK ALL


Once you've done that don't forget to
   refresh -s sendmail

Hi,
  We are having a problem with trying to get a new newsgroup added to 
our news folder in Pine 3.91. Pine is running on VMS and the news server
is running digital's unix. We are able to bring up the group on Netscape
but the same group (MICROSOFT.*) can not be added in Pine. If anyone 
knows what we are doing wrong, or has experienced the same problems. 
please reply via e-mail. We have tried going into setup and changing 
things several different ways. We can add all COMP news groups but the 
Microsoft.* evades us. We're at a loss..... Help!!

					TIA,

...And into this "fixed configuration file" put the settings that you want
in effect and which the users can't override.

Apart from the "features" list of settings this hard-codes the variables
value so that it can't be overridden.  For the list of features only that
one feature is permanently enabled or disabled (if its keyword is prefixed
with "no-").  The other, unlisted, features can still be set/overridden vy
users.

I disagree.  It is precisely because Navigator etc make it so easy to set
up (also "misrepresent", "set up wrongly" and "forge other people's)
e-mail addresses that our University (and, I hope, others) take such a dim
view of them for use as mailers.

The solution we use (as do many sites) is to have a properly managed mail
hub.  All outgoing mail is directed through the hub, which rewrites
headers -- specifically the From: line -- appropriately.  In our case this
is to harmonise the e-mail address to "username@unix.york.ac.uk"
regardless of which machine the message originated from.  It could also
change "username" to "real name" if we so wished (we don't).

This, surely, is the best solution as it doesn't then involve each and
every user duplicating effort (and possibly making mistakes) setting their
own From: line up.

Depends on the situation. The short menu at the bottom of the screen tells
you what Y does. Sometimes (for example, in the message viewer) it's on
the second page (use O Other commands to scroll menu pages). With respect
to messages, Y means print (they spell it prYnt). When prompted yes/no, it
means yes.

You have two possibilities:

(1) Have your local mailer replace the From: lines. Our mailer, for
example, replaces all From: userid@mailserv.uni-tuebingen.de lines by
From: firstname.surname@uni-tuebingen.de.

(2) Make your users insert a customized header From: generic-address
(while viewing this message, press H Header mode to see my From: line).

No big deal, as long as I don't get one of those advs... Remember, my
system (like so many others) tends to send hundreds of Mbs to companies
that send unwanted commercial advs.

If you are using Unix Pine, the default is to print the whole message.
I have not found a way to print a part of message instead of the whole.  
Anyone?

Is there a way to export the contents of an entire folder to a file,
WITHOUT having to do each msg. one by one?
Please reply directly.
:) thanks!

Yes ... use the "Select" and "Apply" commands.

The former allows you to select a set of messages; the latter allows you
to apply a command to the selection.

Before you can use these you may need to turn on the
"enable-aggregate-command-set" in the Setup Configuration screen.

Having done this go to the Index screen on the folder you want to do this
for then type:

	; A		... Select All messages
	A E		... Apply an Export command to the selection
				(then follow the prompts as usual).

Cheers,

Where can I get further information on building PINE with the mbox driver?
PINE behaves in an peculiar manner:

1. PINE is started by a user who has a file ~/mbox.
   All mail from the NFS-mounted spool is appended to the end of ~/mbox
   which serves as the INBOX folder.  When exiting from PINE, the mail
   spool file (/usr/spool/mail/<user>) is empty while all undeleted 
   messages remain in ~/mbox.

2. PINE is started by a user without an ~/mbox file
   Messages from /usr/spool/mail/<user> are used as the INBOX folder.
   When exiting from PINE, undeleted messages remain in the NFS-mounted
   mail spool rather than being copied to ~/mbox.

Can anyone shed some light on how to make PINE behave as in #1 eventhough
a user doesn't have an "mbox" file?

Perhaps this is related: Ever since we went to 3.95 several of our users
report screen emulation problems that they had not had prior to 3.95.
There is no mention of screen changes in the update docs. BUT did
something change in 3.95 vis-a-vis VT-100 emulation?

Pine does indeed maintain a list of ANSI based edit keys that will always
be recognized (arrows, home, end, etc...), but as of version 3.92 this
list just functions as a default.  Starting from this version, Pine will
also obtain a list of valid key sequences from either termcap or terminfo
(depending on the default for your platform).

To avoid a potential change in behavior when upgrading from a Pine release
prior to 3.92, any sequence that attempts to redefine one of Pine's
default "hard coded" keys is ignored (because termcap/terminfo are
notorious for being incomplete or incorrect). Also, any sequence from
termcap/terminfo that doesn't start with an escape is ignored.

> those functions. 

Indeed. By adding "-DTERMCAP_WINS" to the STDCFLAGS definition in the
makefiles pine/makefile.<platform> and pico/makefile.<platform>, any
sequence defined in termcap/terminfo will take precedence over the
defaults of Pine, even if it doesn't start with an escape. As a result,
the arrow keys will now work on any Wyse terminal. 

However, any key that returns a value identical to a Ctrl-<key> function
of Pine or Pico will now have precedence over that function. For example,
if you press Ctrl-K in an attempt to Cut Text in the composer, a cursor up
action will be performed instead (on a Wyse terminal).

You can still access the overlapped functions by using the feature of
Pine/Pico that allows Ctrl-<key> to be entered as ESC ESC <key>, but it
requires a different action on the part of the user.

Exactly! On SCO, for example, most of the Wyse terminals are also support
by a terminal entry that ends in "ak" (for ANSI Keys). When you select
these terminal entries, all edit keys will be programmed with ANSI-like
values (indeed using "is" for termcap and "is2" for terminfo). At the same
time, the "interpret sequence X as key Y" values are changed to match the
new ANSI sequences. Pine would have recognized the ANSI keys anyway using
its hard coded list of keys, but it is necessary to support "vi" & co.

On such systems, specifying TERM as "wy150ak" before calling Pine should
make your edit keys work (it might also require a "tput init" command).

This is indeed the solution to go for if you are lacking the previously
mentioned "ak" entries. Be sure that you DON'T have TERMCAP_WINS enabled
when you are using these scripts. If you do, termcap/terminfo will still
report that certain Ctrl values are to be mapped to keys. Even though Pine
will recognize the reprogrammed ANSI values using its hard coded key list,
pressing an overlapped Ctrl-<key> function would still act like pressing
the key it is "officially" mapped to (gaining nothing over the situation
with just TERMCAP_WINS enabled). 

In general, having TERMCAP_WINS enabled only is a problem if you have
defective termcap/terminfo files or if you are using scripts that will
reprogram your keys. What you gain by enabling it, is right out-of-the-box
support for Wyse terminals (with the forementioned limitations) and (full)
support for a number of other terminals (MAI terminals, anyone?). It
should also be the only way to get the cursor keys of a Wyse 50 to work
because, as far as I know, these keys cannot be reprogrammed. 

I hope this adds some background to the information Knute was kind enough
to supply. I also like to second his idea of putting this information in a
FAQ of some sort. 

Kind regards,

Normally, setting a mailname for the user in sendmail's userdb file
should do the trick -- but only if the mailer doesn't fully-qualify
the sender's From address.
However, there is no way (short of changing source code) to prevent
pine from fully-qualifying the sender's From address.  I'm trying to
work out a way to make sendmail deal with this (de-qualify the name
before userdb lookup), but I'm no sendmail expert.

> Where can I get further information on building PINE with the mbox driver?
> PINE behaves in an peculiar manner:

Interesting question, because we have a "small" spool disk and a
"large" array for home directories, so we want to use mbox.

You've described the way the drivers work.  Note that the order of
appearance in the makefile determines the order in which Pine tries
them; the first one that works gets used.  The mbox driver gets called
on the condition that there is an mbox file.  If so, Pine uses it and
moves new mail into it by itself, as you describe.  If there is no
mbox, Pine moves on to the next driver in the list.

Pine is essentially anti-mbox and the driver seems to be no more than
a concession to users who happen to have an mbox already.  As soon as
the mbox is empty, Pine reverts to its tendency to keep mail in spool.

You might be tempted to do "touch mbox" at login, or in a pine
shellscript wrapper, but it's not good enough!  You will also need to
modify one of the source files to make it accept a zero-length mbox
as "valid".

Hello Mark,

Please tell us what is the version of both PINE
and "Unix machine somewhere" that you are using?

I posted something earlier this week,
about what we are experiencing which is also a case 
of freezing up. In our case Unix (aix4.1.4) session
is frozen when PINE3.95 loses its imap connection 
with the server (also on aix4.1.4) ...


Thanks,

Is there a way to have Pine not expand a distribution list?  I have an
alias that is a distribution list of email addresses.  I would like to
not have it be expanded, and included in everyone's message.  I would
like to protect the privacy of each member of the list, to prevent some
member getting the addresses of other members of the list.

	When sending to the list, put the DL in the Lcc: field rather
than the To: or Cc:.  You need to do a ^R with the cursor in the

This is how the code was designed; ~/mbox is used only if there is one.

Modify mbox.c so that it unconditionally creates an ~/mbox file in
mbox_valid() instead of only going through if one exists.

The mh indicator is "#mh", not "mh#".

You don't list the mh path directory either.

I just upgraded to pine V3.95 on my Solaris 2.4 platform. Before this, I
had been using V3.91. Speed improved, a few new features added.

However, I don't see any plus mark right beside the messages coming
directly to me. This mark helped me a lot with finding such messages in my
old Pine. Does anybody know how to get it to work again in my new Pine?

Thanks in advance.

=09Pine now has a new config variable called "alt-addresses ".
Set that variable to the various addresses you may be known by and the
+ will reappear.

Is there any reason why when I try to post to two groups with pine 3.95,
the post doesn't seem to appear in any of them? This is being cc'ed to
supernet.test to test the theory.. any ideas?

Hello Pinesters,

Here's the deal: When I access Pine, which is running in my student 
account on a Unix machine somewhere (Korn shell), it freezes up when I 
scroll too quickly through my index of messages using the cursor keys.  
Sometims it just freezes, period.

I am accessing pine through an aging lan run on sub-286 pcs, using 
netware 3.62 for dos, and clarkson universities telnet client.  I believe 
we are using some kind of ipx packet driver, but I'm not sure.

The odd thing is, when I telnet into the same account from an old 
account, everything works fine.


Any ideas?

Does anyone know when:

 * the Netscape server software will include an IMAP daemon?
 * the Netscape mail client will be able to access mail folders
   using IMAP?
 * the Netscape news client will be able to access news groups
   using IMAP?

What about other browsers, like MSIE, will it's mail and news
clients be able to use IMAP?

Thanks,
Nancy

It says Print.  That is it!

Which has little significance to me since I am at home, and printing a 
file on a printer from the host machine has no relevance.

I still have no clue what it does.  Someone suggested to me that I use it 
for some purpose.

Why doesn't Pine Help describe it?

Looked at Joseph's web page.  I actually need to go from Netscape to

Any clues?

     This really should be added to the faq since it comes up at least
once a week.  The trick is to use a program that is availible on most
Unix systems called vacation.  Just type vacation and if you have it,
you can edit a message that will automatically be sent to people who
mail to you.  When you come back, type vacation again and it will be removed.

	Is it possible to disable MIME in Pine? Certainly i don't want to dig
sources... Every time when Pine find russian text, it turns letter body and
subject line into gribberish, and 90% of other mail readers DON'T support it.
So i'm stuck with elm :-(

Date: 30 Jul 1996 23:35:51 GMT
Message-Id: <4tm68n$b58@uucp.intac.com>

	I just changed to another IP and was wondering why the spell 'CTL t'
doesn't work on the Pine 3.91. I get a 'user/bin/spell not found'. 
Should I be looking for spell or Ispell in my /user/bin dir. How could I 
search the entire network dir to find where spell or Ispell is at. Is there
a way I could tell pine in the configure to point to where spell is 
really at?

Is there an easy (or relatively easy) way to set "follow-up-to" in a news
post using pine? If there is, I can't find it.. a slot in the headers
(rich headers - ^R) was all that occured to me.. and I couldn't see
anything there.. would I need to set something in complex-headers?

    In your personal configuration, you can add customized headers. 
Then, when you invoke ^R, "Follow-up-to:" (or however you spell it)
it will be there for you to fill in.  I don't know of any automatic way 
to fill in the actual value, and I would presume you wouldn't want to,
anyway, because, depending on cross-posting, you might want to fill 
it in this way or that.

I cant find a reference in the help file and found nothing on the config

	You don't say which version of pine you are using.....

	In 3.94+ (3.95 being the current version) you have:

reply-indent-string      = <No Value Set: using "> ">

	You can't.

	You need to use something like the "vacation" program which
is available on many varities of U*NIX.

	It may have more significance than you expect.

	Go to the M(ain) menu.  They type S(etup) followed by P(rinter).

	I suspect that "print" is fairly obvious.

Hi.  Wondering how I can locate a message that someone has forwarded tko
me through PINE?  What is the procedure?  I have an indication that the
message is there but I cannot find it.  I pressed the "Whereis" key and
tyhped in the subject word of forwarded message and got this line:  "
found on line 4".  Thanks for any help.

Steve,
	
	Not sure I understand your question.....

	But instead of sending a reply I did a forward to you of your
message.  You can see that the Subject: line contains (fwd) and the
text contains:  Forwarded message.

	Is that the indication you are interested in?

	Regards,

	Hummmm....you either have Fcc: in your list of "view-headers" in
your configuration or some other setting that is causing Fcc: to contain
something other than the default.  I say this since Fcc: is generally
*not* visiable unless I have it set in the alias definition.  If it
the default "outbox" then it does not show.

	Looking at the "view-headers" help we find:

The default list of headers includes:  From, Resent-From, To, Resent-To,
Cc, Resent-cc, Bcc, Newsgroups, Followup-To, Date, Resent-Date,
Subject, Resent-Subject, and Reply-To.

	BTW, it is not clear to me if the "view-headers" applies to 
composing or only to reading.  I'd test it now....but my cat keeps walking
all over the keyboard making life difficult at the moment..  :-)

	Regards,

		Ed & Misty

Put the alias in the Lcc field which you see by selecting Control R for
rich header. Then only the group alias not all the addresses will appear
in the To field of your message, as sent and as received.

If you're using a decent telnet or dialup client, it may be possible to
print directly to a locally attached printer.  Your software has to support
`pass-thru' printing; if it does you can print to a local printer.

If you have a printer attached to your local computer, try going into the 
setup/printer area, and activating `ANSI passthrough printing', and then 
see what happens.

okay, that was a typo in the message I had tried both anyway.

I've managed to work it out now.

I needed to have a .mh_profile that has at least:

Path: Mail/

in it and then specify #mh/foo for the MH folders in ~/Mail.

Can't seem to locate the forwarded text that was sent to me.  Tried
"Whereis" which gave me a line "found on line 4" after I entered the
subject of the forwarded post.  Then I tried the "Fwd" key and that only
gave me the forward a message (outgkoing).  What I need to know is where
do I find a forwarded message to me?  I think this guy whould have
"attached" these text files rather than "forwarded " them.  I suspect they
are lost.  Thanks for any help.

Is there any way that the standalone binary for pico can support the
mouse in the same manner that Pine does?

I'm quite happy that the support was added to pine, but I also use pico
constantly and it would be a great feature. I only hope that it's not
just available in the pico library that Pine uses.

I apologise if this was mentioned somewhere (obscure?), but I didn't
find anything in any FAQ or mail archives.

Thank you,

No. "view-hdrs" allows the user to customize which headers are displayed
while reading messages. (To view all headers, enable 
"allow-full-header-command" and type "h" while viewing messages.)

"default-composer-hdrs" affects which headers are displayed while
composing messages. ^r displays additional headers in the composer.

If either option is invoked, the user must prepare an entire list of 
headers he wishes to display. He may not add headers to the default list.

"customized hdrs", on the other hand, allows the user to add headers to 
the default list for use during composing. A default value may also be 
provided. But, to be displayed in the composer without using ^r, they 
must also be added to "default-composer-hdrs".

How do you extract or save attachments sent to you from other mail 
servers.  Example, I often get "ENCODED" documents (MS WORD) that require 
"UUDECODE" to extract?  How is this done??

    Actually, I think we both stand partially corrected.  Unless one is
taking the default, which in Pine 3.94 (and probably earlier versions,
as well) -- and the default does *not* contain Fcc:, contrary to what I
thought -- what controls what one sees as headers when composing
without pressing ^R is default-composer-hdrs: in the configuration. 
Viewer-hdrs controls what one sees when *viewing*, not when *composing*. 
If you put in _anything_ beyond the default in default-composers-hdrs:,
then you must put in _everything_ you want to see, including the items
that would be otherwise be defaulted.

    I have had Fcc: in my default-composer-hdrs: for so long that I
forgot it was not a default item.  To that extent I was in error in my
original response, and I should have noted that one could make Fcc:
appear all the time without ^R by setting it in the congifuration.

	Under "normal" conditions and if you are running on a U*IX system
you can use the "|" pipe command (needs to be enabled in the config...)
and pipe (pass) the contents of the message body to a uudecode program.

more research.  I could have put the cat....but I'm on the 7th floor
and that may have been a bit extreme. :-)

Nancy,
Netscape mail server 2.0Beta2 is available now, and includes IMAP4
support.  IMAP support in the client comes with the "Galileo" release
at the end of the year.  See  www.imap.org/whatsnew.html under "Recent
IMAP-related products and services announcements" section for articles
about both.

Not sure about news access via IMAP.

Several MS product groups are working on IMAP support.  If you go to 
www.microsoft.com and do a search on "IMAP" you'll get several hits.

Ed,
I'm glad you waited for the cat to go to sleep... I'd hate to think
that Pine was responsible for your furry critter trying to learn
how to fly.

This is not a strictly Pine question - but ...

Anyone out there know of a bulletin board program that will run under SCO
Unix. We are using Wildcat in DOS but we want to get the bulletin board
into the Unix environment.

On my PC (486, 8 MB ram, Windows 3.1) Pine has worked extremely well until
recently on printing out e-mail from the screen. I currently use the
Windows Terminal utility program for e-mail.

Now, when I use the command "Y" to print out an e-mail letter, if the
letter is about 1K bytes or less, Pine prints out the letter on "attached
desktop (ANSI) printer" with no faults.

However if the letter exceeds about 1K in length, Pine stops displaying
the balance of the letter, but continues sending all screens that occur
following the aborted letter to the buffer from which the printer is
loaded in my PC, until I quit Pine. When I log off the host, the printer
prints out the part of the letter before it was aborted, plus all of the
screens transmitted to my PC after the partial letter.  The buffer in my
PC for the printer shows perhaps 20K to 30K of material for printout,
while the entire letter may have been only 2K.

I have discussed this with local manager, and looked at the debug files
for Pine, but have been unable to find any indication, except the word 
"babble" in the debug file, which might refer to the difficulty.

I have re-loaded Pine, with default settings, but this produces the same
results. 

Is there any way to diagnose this problem and correct it?

Roland Cook

Does anyone have experience and success with printing using the "Y"
command to a local attached desk jet / laser printer? Setting the printer
configuration to "1-attached to ansi" doesn't work.

Help!  I do not subscribe to this list, so please post answers directly to
me. Thanks!

1.  Start Pine and go to its Setup Configuration screen ("S" then "C" from
    its Main Menu.)

2.  Set the value of the "nntp-server" variable to that of your NNTP
    (News) server.  Without Step 3 (below) this will set things up to read
    and post news via NNTP.

3.  Put the cursor on the "news-collections" variable and read the on-line
    help for it.  This explains about how to set up a "news collection".
    Typically you want something like this:
	*{news.site.domain}[]

Things to note:

*  Step 3 sets up news _reading_ via IMAP.  However the nntp-server
variable must still be set up if you plan to _post_ news articles.

*  Setting nntp-server but leaving news-collections empty sets up a
default news collection for reading news via NNTP from the machine
specified in nntp-server.  It is equivalent to a news-collection of:
	*{news.site.domain/nntp}[]
(The "/nntp" says that NNTP should be used instead of (the default) IMAP.)

*  All this assumes that your system administrator who manages you IMAP
server has set it up to provide access to Usenet news.  This is not
necessarily the case; check with them.

It *sounds* like Pine is sending data to your printer at a rate faster
than it can cope with (ie, print out).  This causes a backlog, which build
up in the printer's internal memory buffer.

When this becomes (nearly) full the printer attempts to tell the thing
sending the data to stop for a while.  This can be done in one of two ways
(depending on your printer model, how it is configured, and the lead
connecting it).

Printers with a parallel printer interface often (but not always) use
"hardware handshaking".  This involves an extra wire which the printer
uses to signal whether it accepted the last data character or not.

The alternative is "software flow control".  With this two special control
characters are used to mean "stop sending data" and "resume sending data".
These are invariably Ctrl/S and Ctrl/Q respectively.

By default Pine does not honour these characters (if it did, and the user
accidentally typed Ctrl/S on the keyboard Pine would appear to hang
indefinitely -- actually until a Ctrl/Q were typed).

However it is possible to tell Pine to honour them, and is what you should
try in the first instance.  You do this very simply:

*  Start Pine, and go to the Setup Configuration screen ("S" then "C" from
   the Main Menu).

*  Look for the feature called "preserve-start-stop-characters" and make
   sure it is selected (an "X" appears in the box next to it).

*  Exit from the Setup Configuration screen, locate a reasonably long
   message, and try printing it.

Good luck!

I can't get Pine to draw the screen correctly on a Wyse 60. Everything
works fine, except pine. When you get main menu, it doesn't show anything.
However, as you hit the arrow keys to scroll, it shows the highlighted
line and then when you go to the next line, it leaves the one behind...
like it should. 

My question is how to I get pine to write to the screen properly.

First, thank you for your prompt reply and attention to this problem.

Second, I have used Pine for about two years, with no problem at all.
Several weeks ago the host found a defective telephone line that was
causing many problems, apart from Pine, such as login, carrier drop, etc.
On resuming use of Pine following this disaster, Pine now shows the
symptoms I described.

Third, I am apparently the only one on this host having this problem!
This would point to my computer, although nothing has changed.  I have
checked all lines etc. On everything but the printout command Pine
shows no other symptoms, except it was truncating various messages on
the screen, overlapping other things, and generally misbehaving in minor
ways.  But it would export files, save, etc. all in good order.  It will
display everything on the screen also.

Fourth, my terminal setting in windows is set for 300 lines, before
loading into a buffer for printing (not the printer buffer) -- that is,
lines, not bytes, about 24K bytes, in other words.

Fifth, when I log out, the file in Windows has all the transmissions from
Pine (every screen, command, etc. sent by the host to my screen) including
the part of the letter that was aborted.  In other words, the "Y" command
successfully downloads the e-mail up to about 1K bytes on the screen and
stops, but continues transmitting from there on into my computer, for
printout when I sign off. There is no limit in any buffer in my computer
that has shown up yet. Pine does not print out the aborted part of the
letter until I sign off.

I have tried setting the X-on, X-off in the configurations settings for
Pine and then when the letter aborts using ^Q (X-on) to no avail, And
toggling between ^X and ^Q has no effect either. Of course Pine worked
fine without all this prior to the recent discombobulation.

Yes, tried this as described above. Pine's default settings originally
worked OK.

With pine 3.95 (linux precompiled binaries and DEC Alpha OSF (compiled
locally), I have the following problem.

The look-up file created with -create_lu and the look-up file created
by interactive pine for the same address books are not the
same (differ in the last two lines).  Furthermore, pine does not seem to
accept the one created by -create_lu as correct, so insists on rebuilding
its own.  This occured with the global addressbook.  I haven't tested
it with other (smaller) address books.

I think we've finally figured this trick out.  Instead of setting

			  default-fcc=saved-messages

or using the default, one has to use

			default-fcc=#MH/saved-messages

The "to" field checks the "Cc:", too.

Greetings,

Some of the messages in my sent-mail folder when viewed show my name and
not who they were sent to. Some messages when viewed show who they were
sent to (which is the prefered behavior). I have looked at the messages in
the Unix tool less and I can not see the difference between the two sets
of messages.

Does anyone have any idea why this is happening? This is very annoying!

Thanks

Dave

Hi,

	On a reply to a message of which you are a Bcc receipient I feel
it would be "nice" if pine could issue you a warning when asking if you
want to "Reply to all recipients?".  Maybe a 2 step process?  

1.	Acknowledge that you are aware of being Bcc'd: 

2.	Asked "Reply to all recipients?".

	Comments?

Please HELP!

	To expedite a PINE file's storage into a new EUDORA program, I
Renamed the entire file INBOX (because then I could access them directly into
EUDORA).  Strangely enough, the operation was performed but all its contents
were deleted!  I was never asked if I was sure I wanted to delete all 109
files.  My lord, is there no way to recover them?  INBOX (the original) still
has the same, sole "read only" file it formerly had (as the original had
already been saved in Eudora).  Then the "other" INBOX, when observed to
contain that same darned message, is no longer even in the directory!   
It, and those 109 important messages have seemingly vanished.  Or have 
they?

I'm eager to get in touch with them and I hope you could help me.
 Lastly, if you don't mind, please list down the news collection goups'

  Thank You. Bye.

An suggestion, it would be nice to be able to select filters to incoming
email as we can select filters to outgoing email.

This could be useful, for example, when there is an pgp signed email in
inbox, but you don't have the pgp key for the email. The result is that
there appears no mail at all.

This is not the most elegant solution, but will work:
on the ABSOLUTE FIRST line of your post, put "Follow-up-to: wherever"
without the quotes. wherever= whatever you want that to be.

For other types of encoding, `mpack' and `munpack' are useful tools to
have.

Before saying anything further let me say that I have not tried this
but...

I *really* expect this NOT to work (at least with Pine).

Pine's message composition screen maintains two distinct areas: one for
header information, one for the message text.

When these are combined, just before passing to sendmail (or whatever) for
delivery the headers are properly formatted *and a blank line placed after
them* before the message text itself is included.

The blank line signifies to mail delivery software that the headers have
ended, and that what follows is message text.  Thus it is impossible using
this model to add a header by including it as the first line of your
message body text.

(By the way, the proper name of the field in question is "Followup-to:")

Cheers,

Mike Brudenell                                         <pmb1@york.ac.uk>

Hi, friends,
is there any bound for the size of an attachment to send?
Is the bound configurable?

We can't send a 2,7 Mbytes binary file neither in one attachment nor
divided in 2 attachments (in one mail). Pine 3.92 writes the message
"File too long".

I would appreciate your help.

I would like to know if anyone has installed pine 3.91 under IRIX 5.3.
If so, could you send me details on what build or makefile modification
are  necessary.

Thanks for the info, but I'm not real proficient in working with Pine 
pipe commands.  Could you give me an example of the syntax used on the 
UNIX.

simply when reading the message, press the "|" key, then type in "uudecode" 
This will result in the file being created in your present directory.

	I have had a terrible time printing from Pine, UWin, etc.  The
computer sooner or later gets frozen, even though I have done nothing
wrong, so far as I can tell.
	If there is a way to avoid crashing my computer again and again, I
would be very happy to hear it.  This is very time-consuming.
	The most recent occurrence was this morning, when I accessed an
old "sent mail" and printed it out.  The capture never went off, the
computer would not respond, I had to reboot.
	Please help.

I'm trying to help a new ISP debug their IMAP setup. They have the IMAP
daemon defined in inetd.conf properly. When I try to login to the IMAP server
using PC-Pine, I get a message saying "Bad Login User Name and/or Password".
I can telnet to the server with no problems and POP mail off the server works
fine, all with the same login ID and password I'm trying to use for IMAP. Any
ideas why IMAP wouldn't like the ID and/or password?

   I did. I installed 3.91, 3.92 and 3.95. The compilation is pretty easy
   do a "./build clean ; ./build sgi" and the binary will be in the bin
   directory.  One good way to build pine is to figure out your os and
   machine name by looking in the pine/osdep directory and then doing 
   a "build xxx" where xxx is the os-xxx.h corrosponds to the name and
   of of the machines. More info available at

John,
Don't know if this is what you're experiencing or not, but some versions
of imapd don't like certain special characters in passwords.  I'm not
sure which characters, nor which code this is fixed in, though.  You could
try an acct with a simple password to determine if this is the cause.

We don't know of any significant memory leaks in Pine 3.95.  What
alternate editor are you using and what is the system load like when
this occurs?

Check out the latest version of Eudora, 3.0 which makes direct links to
Web URLs. Also, Now Up-to-Date 3.6 lets you list both e-mail addresses and
URLs; when you click on them, Netscape launches and completes the link.
Hence you can use the best features of your browser, e-mail, and PIM. I
think that the latest Claris E-Mailer also provides these links.

I've just tried upgrading to pine 3.95 from 3.93. 3.93 has been reliable
and stable etc. The message that it hangs on has the following format.
pine 3.93 is fine but 3.95 just shows the "busy" indicator and no other
activity until I kill it. This is on SunOS4 . The amount of text is small.

Thanks.

Try being brave enough to use the Setup (S) command at Pine's Main Menu,
followed by Configuration (C).

This takes you to a wonderful screen where you can configure lots of
options which control Pine's behaviour.  Have a look through them -- they
all have contaxt-sensitive help (just put your cursor on them and type a
"?").  Look at "signature-at-bottom" in particular.

By the way, the reasoning behind Pine's default behaviour is that your
reply is (hopefully) the important content of the message you are about to
send, not the previous text (which is for memory-jogging/context only).
Thus by putting the text of your reply at the beginning it is immediately
accessible by the recipient, saving them from having to wade through reams
of old text to get to your response.

Cheers,

Mike Brudenell                                         <pmb1@york.ac.uk>

Maybe my settings are wrong, as one particular mail list is filtered 
great if it is in the To line, but does not get filtered at all (and thus 
goes into the Inbox) when it is in the Cc line.

I save mail from persons a, b, c etc in their respective folders.  Can I
automate this so that, having read my new mail, upon exiting pine, mail
from these senders are saved in their proper folders and marked deleted
in the inbox? Are programs like filter or procmail of any use for this
purpose? Pine version is 394.

When I enter pine, I get an error message saying domain name incomplete, 
messages may not be received correctly or something like that.  I am 
fairly certain that this is because I am not on the net, and the only 
name we have right now is the UNIX box name.  How do I disable this erro 
message?

Just yesterday, we upgraded our PC's from PC-PINE 3.92 to 3.95.  One
complaint we have been getting from our users is that the tree won't go
back to being green after reading new messages.

(You know, when minimized the tree turns red if a new message comes in...)

Apparently, it turned back to green in the 3.92 version.  I'm not sure
what 3.93 and 3.94 did, but 3.95 will stay red unless they completely
close out of PC-PINE.

Here in our IS department, we are running Win95, so the 3.95 update works
great (puts a tree in the systray when a new message arrives if pine is
minimized).

Is this colorful tree a bug or what?  I just want to let my users know
whether this is supposed to be like this, or not.  If it is a Pine-bug or
something, I can give them the explanation that we'll need to wait for the
next update.

My boss is on my back on this one.  Anyone have ideas or suggestions?

I really appreciate any help.  Thanks.

ELM's filter has a bug with this as it only checks "Cc:" but not "cc:".
A patch is available on page
	http://www.math.fu-berlin.de/~guckes/elm/patches/#filter

This must be the 1000th time I am posting this.
And ELM's filter is dropped by the developers, anyway.

Folks - please use procmail!  It has better support.
Even though the siyntax for filter rules are not
as nice as with ELM's filter.

If you still want to use ELM's filter then PLEASE read the page
	http://www.math.fu-berlin.de/~guckes/elm/elm.filter.html

Can anyone explain this to me?  I checked the pine archives
and I took tha advise of past posts.  I put a bogus entry in
the To: field like so:

distribution list :;
                  ^^ here's the magical incantaion, right?

and then added recipients to the Lcc: field.  It seems that
it made it out to the recipient sites OK, but they couldn't
deal with the To: user supplied (i.e. the incantation).
What did I do wrong?  What does that ":;" do anyway?  Where
can I read up on this in some detail?  By the way, I'm using
Pine3.94 precompiled Solaris 2.x binary.

Thanks in advance.

I saw this error message for the first time when I upgraded from 3.91 to
3.93.  From the main menu, choose S)etup and then C)onfiguration.  Right
near the top you will see a setting for user-domain.  Set this to the
domain name.  The machine that I had this happen with was
homer.csc.tntech.edu.  When sending mail to someone on the local system,
the addresses always came out somebody@homer, so I set user-domain to
csc.tntech.edu, and all addresses come out as
somebody@homer.csc.tntech.edu and no more warning message. :)

No, that won't work.

To save the text without the headers, use the View command. This will 
bring up the message viewer index. A message without attachments has one 
part, the body. Then, use the Save command, to name a file to save the 
message to.

If you want to save all the headers, enable the "display full headers" 
feature in the configuration file. Then, view the message and issue the 
Headers command. Then, Export the message to a file you name.

Re: Multiple Attachements

A cautionary note about piping attachments from within Pine.  (tested with
3.95)

If your message contains more than one uuencoded file, the pipe to
uudecode fails.  If you pipe to munpack (a multi-format decoder), the
first file gets decoded and subsequent files are ignored (okay, I only
tried it with two ;) but that's what happened.)

The safest way I've found to decode is to export the message and split the
files into individual uuencoded files and uudecode or munpack each.

WELCOME!

It's that time of year, when schools fill up with new students using Pine
for the first time.

I would like to unofficially (I'm just a Pine user, like you) welcome you
to the list/newsgroup and to invite you to read your Getting Started with
Pine and all the excellent context-sensitive help screens and prompts that
are part of Pine.

This will help you in getting the most out of Pine and will minimize the
bandwidth on the list/newsgroup with rather basic questions.  

To help discover many of the advanced features of Pine, go into Setup,
Configuration from the main menu and press ? on each feature.  This will
allow you to understand how you can customize your Pine for your own
tastes. 

Regards and good luck in school,

Don Sugarman, Pine user

Sure it does.

I believe Ed's message implied allowing the user to then edit the header

Next time, check the amount of free memory and swap.  Even without a
memory leak, you could run into memory fragmentation problems if you
are low on memory anyway.  One thing to try is re-compiling with a
different malloc() that is more aggressive about returning freed
memory to the system...

Subject: Campus-wide use of PC-Pine (Win) - large address books
Date: Wed, 14 Aug 1996 17:56:48 +0100
Message-Id: <Pine.GSO.3.95.960814175240.4819A-100000@crocus>
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

3 weeks or so back there was a thread on setting up PC-Pine (in that case
the Win95 version) for wide-spread use in campus environments. 

A question I meant to raise at the time is whether anyone has found a way
of using large address books with the Windows version.  Our interest is in
Windows 3.11.  Currently we maintain a campus-wide address book for Pine
on Unix, which has nearly 14,000 entries for staff and students - the raw
file is more than 1 MB in size.  This works fine in that environment; the
only problem is that it's a little slow on searching, but users can live
with this. 

However if I try the same address book with the Windows version, PC-Pine
falls over immediately with a GPF.  An earlier version (3.93 from memory,
but I can't be sure) would load the first page of the address book but
then freeze up completely as soon as any operation was attempted.  I guess
it simply cannot handle address books of this size. 

We have thought of splitting the address book into chunks, either by
University department or by sections of the alphabet.  Before trying
possible schemes it seemed worth enquiring whether there's any experience
of this or any other approach.  Can anyone give for example any kind of
upper limit on address book size, which the Windows version is known to
accept?  Equally important, are there any limits on the number of global
address books PC-Pine can hold in its list?

Any ideas on this one would be welcome, either by posting to the group or
by direct email.  I have even wondered about last ditch solutions like
using a separate ph client and using cut and paste to transfer the address
into Pine (far from ideal, but other mail systems in use on campus like
Eudora and Pegasus/POP3 both have built-in support for ph, so it would
serve several needs).  If there's enough interest I'll be glad to
summarise. 

TIA,

Alan

Sendmail.  Don't wade into this until you have simpler things working.

>smail, lmail, deliver)

I don't know about lmail, but deliver isn't a transport agent; it just
delivers on the local machine.  I use sendmail because it is extremely
flexible.

Learn Unix before trying to configure a Unix machine.  Really.

Have you read the Linux-ISP HOWTO?  (I may have the name slightly
wrong, but ISP is the point.)  I disagree with some of its
recommendations, but it's a good starting point.

> Also, how do you get Pine to start communicating with the

Actually, in your case it's probably better to tell pine to use your
ISP's SMTP server, at least until you get sendmail running nicely.

man popclient.  Look for the "-k" option.

I'm actually in the early stages of writing something to help with
your problems (your questions are very common, and I'm unsatisfied
with many of the solutions being recommended), but I don't expect to
have anything done for a few months.

Check news.software.nntp and the Linux News HOWTO.  You might also
want to see comp.os.linux.setup -- it would be more appropriate than
comp.mail.pine, although the traffic is pretty high and there are
probably more questions than answers there.

I have a similar problem:  The contents of my sent-mail folders started
being listed by _my_ name.  After a point the problem was evidently
fixed; mail sent since Jul 31 is listed correctly.  However, everything
I have saved from before then is still listed by my name.  I tried
adding an address under alt-adresses--no luck.  Can anyone help?

Here's a wierd one, (which I admit up front, I haven't had time to really
study).  A number of people, (myself included) are reporting that the To: 
field in their sent-mail folder is always set to their name, (as opposed
to the person they are sent the mail to).  I've checked the setup/config
menus and can find no setting which would determine this behavior.  Has
anyone else seen this or corrected it?

I've tried a suggestion to get the "upload" option in PINE 3.95 to work, but
it still does not start.

The upload command option in PINE's configuation is set to "rz -eb " but when
it activates, this is displayed:

rz: ready to receive /usr/tmp/pu009546

Beginning a zmodem send from the terminal fails to start the transfer. Is this
option enabled?

Thanks a lot!!!

Consider this feature in future versions of pine: to include a control key
press for advancing to the top or bottom when reading or composing a
message.  Currently, when a message gets very long, you may have to hit
Ctrl-Y or Ctrl-V many times to advance to the top or bottom of the
message.

Current work around: use an external viewer or editor.

SearchWords: keyboard shortcut, advance to top, advance to bottom

Subject: Setting up Mail and News in Linux
Date: Wed, 14 Aug 1996 02:29:23 GMT
Message-Id: <4urhal$c4d@uhura.phoenix.net>

(Warning; this question is from a sincere, but ignorant, Linux
beginner; assume the following questions are going to sound like he
doesn't know what he's doing)

I would like to use a Linux box for cruising the Internet. I've
figured out how to get the PPP connection going and can use the
Internet browser included with the version of Linux I've got (Redhat
2.1 with Arena for a browser).

I've been able to send mail to myself using Pine (although it comes
from "root <root (none)>"). I can't figure out, though, how to
retrieve mail from my ISP. I've read the "Mail HOW-TO" (at least 3
times) and have the Linux Network Administrators Guide but, frankly it
doesn't make sense to me. I don't understand from the instructions in
this documentation how to set up the "mail transport agent".

What I'd like to know is :

What transport agent would be appropriate for me to use (Sendmail,
smail, lmail, deliver) and where could I get some good succinct
instructions about how to set it up ? (My struggle with a lot of Linux
documentation is that it seems to assume a certain level of Unix or
Linux experience which I don't have.) The usage is simply a dial up
PPP connection, with a stand alone Linux computer not connected to any
network. Also, how do you get Pine to start communicating with the
transport agent ? 

While getting the mail connection up and going, and testing the
system, I would like to be able to have the mail stay on the ISP's
server and not get deleted when I download it. After it's working fine
and seems reliable, I would then like to have the mail deleted after
retrieving it to my own computer.

Any sympathizers out there who can help me out ?

Paul Greene

P.S. A final note: I also have some questions regarding getting Usenet
up and running on the same machine; is this an appropriate newsgroup
for those kind of questions ? If not, where would be a good place to
try ?

I'm using Pine 3.91 on Linux, and whenever I download

I also receive another bogus message with no title

Why is this?

At login level, do a "/bin/rm .pinerc".  This should remove (delete) the
.pinerc file.  When you launch Pine again, you will create another one
with defaults in all the configurable fields.

Ctrl-W Ctrl-Y takes you to the top.
 
Ctrl-W Ctrl-V takes you to the bottom.

Hoax alert!  Hoax alert!
 
This is the infamous "Good Times Virus" hoax that has been resurfacing
about every six months for the past two or three years.  The Good Times
virus does not exist, nor has the FCC ever issued a warning about it, nor
can you transmit a virus in the manner described. 
 
Please don't waste bandwidth by redistributing this rubbish.

I'm trying to set up PCPine but I don't understand what it needs 
for a PPP packet driver. Could someone give me a rundown on 
connecting Pine to the Internet via PPP?

Hehehehe, I haven't read lately anything so funny.. espcecially the
paragraph above.. but haven't you forgot to mention that virus uses
monitor radiation to (display &) transport it cells to reader of the email
and kill him as well :) 

Of curiosity, if I'll have double-cpu comptuer then the infinte loop will
be of 2*nth-complexity or 2^nth-complexity ?

Hi,

   I've got a bit of a problem with pico on one of our vms boxes. I got the
new (3.95) version of pine and tried building Pico myself.  It built O.K.
and apart from some display problems seemed to run OK.  Then I tried a ^T to
browse the files.  This is when it crashed!  From the archives, I managed to
find a site with pre-compiled binaries.  This too crashed in the same spot,
although with a somewhat different error (the VAX version worked fine).  It
crashed with an access violation with this message:

   Improperly handled condition, image exit forced.
     Signal arguments:   Number = 00000005
     			 Name   = 0000000C
			 	  00000000
				  7EBB19BF
				  00047E4C
				  0000001B
				  
     then a register dump
				 
Anybody got any ideas what's going on?  Any fixes?

Thanks for anything,

Andrew

Careful!  The whole point of the "magical incantation" is to avoid
problems with some delivery software.  In particular if the recipients are
only listed in the Cc and/or Bcc fields (ie, with no To field specified)
then some delivery software happily reveals the "hidden" list as a series
of "Apparently-To:" fields.

Having a To field along the lines of "List Name:;" is exactly right in
these circumstances.

However I seem to recall that the magical ":;" parsing fails if one has a
misconfigured sendmail.  Can anyone recall more details about this?

Cheers,

Oh come on.... this thing has been floating around for YEARS!!! Give it
a break!
Pray tell, how can a text file execute itself????  Seems like everytime
this
spam is dead, it rears its ugly head again,  and a billion users start
sending
chain mail everwhere regarding the thing.  YOU CANNOT GET A VIRUS SIMPLY
BY READING
A TEXT FILE.  PERIOD.

Cheers,
Vivek.

Subject: Command Line String for Folders
Date: Thu, 15 Aug 1996 06:00:53 -0400
Message-Id: <Pine.SUN.3.94.960815054716.6608B-100000@access5.digex.net>
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

    I am using Pine 3.94 under SunOS 4.1.4.  I dial in from a DOS PC
running Procomm Plus V2.  Procomm Plus allows one to set "meta" keys,
Alt key combinations which will automatically play back a set of
keystokes, invoke a prerecorded PCPlus script, etc.

    For instance, I have a meta key set up to play back the sequence

        pine -l -Il,i

From the shell prompt, this starts Pine with folder collections
expanded and goes directly into my INBOX.

    My problem is this.  I have two folder collections defined, the
first for mail folders and the second for newsgroups.  What I am trying
to do is set up a command line string analogous to the one above which
will start Pine from the shell prompt with folder collections expanded
and go to the first newsgroup ("folder," so to speak) in the second
(newsgroup) collection.  At this point I don't care whether it actually
opens the group or not.  I just want to save having to cursor all the
way down into the second collection.

    I did come up with one command line string which went where I
wanted and actually opened the first newsgroup in the collection.  The
only problem is that somehow my .newsrc file got bypassed, and the
group was opened with something like 871 items, all that were on my
news server for that group, rather than just the unread items.

    The solution may be right in front of my nose, but so far I haven't 
found it.  If anyone has any ideas, I will be grateful.

Thanks.

Let me pose a different question.. this may have been asked, but if so I
missed the answer.

Will pine support kill files for eMail or useNet in the near (or distant)
future? :-)

	Ahhh....you have revealed the *true* nature of this virus!
It is a social engineering virus which causes "billion users" to start
sending this around thus taking up bandwidth, disk space, and people's
time.

	Other than wanting to chop down this virus I suppose it has
nothing to do with pine(tree).

	Now back to our regularly scheduled program.....

Sigh. Again???


Hello,
  You've warned us about the Good Time virus. It's not real. Here's a 
full newsletter on the topic. Thanks for warning us, though! It's nice to 
know that you are concerned enough to bring this to our attention. After 
all, the next one might be real. Thanks again.

SUBJECT: E-mail virus is a hoax.

SUMMARY: ASSIST has received numerous requests for information
about a computer virus virus known as "Good Times" that is
traversing the Internet and infects systems through e-mail.  THE
GOOD TIMES VIRUS MESSAGE IS A HOAX.  DO NOT FORWARD THE MESSAGE
ON GOOD TIMES TO OTHER PERSONS AND PROPAGATE THE RUMOR FURTHER.

BACKGROUND: The Good Times hoax was initiated in late 1994 and
after investigation the origination of the message was traced to a 
student at a university site and a user of America Online.  There 
have been several variations of the message with a basic theme of
"this electronic mail message with the subject line of "xxx-1" 
will infect your computer".  The spread of the hoax was accelerated
when many people saw a a message with "Good Times" in the header. 
They deleted the message without reading it, thus believing that they
have saved themselves from being attacked. These first-hand reports 
give a false sense of credibility to the alert message.

The initial Good Times incident ended in December 1994 and there
was virtually no traffic on the subject until early April 1995
when another round of hoax messages began circulating on the
network.  The most common April 1995 version of the message
contained references to public statements from the Federal
Communications Commission and America Online as to Good Times
being verified as a legitamate virus.  This second round of Good
Times messages is also a hoax and based on the same false reports
as the 1994 Good Times messages.

As of this time, there are no known viruses which can infect merely
through reading a mail message, for a virus to infect and spread
a file must be executed.  Simply reading a text message does not
cause execution of any files.  It would be possible for malicious
code to be transferred as an attachment or within the body (i.e
uuencoded) of a message, but then the file would have to be
decoded and separate action taken outside of a mailer to execute
the file.  In addition, it would be extremely difficult for 
malicious code to be written to infect an environment as diverse 
as the Internet.  There are so many different types and versions
of operating systems and mailers in use on the Internet that
writing a piece of code that would succesfully infect any 
recipient of an e-mail message would be highly unlikely.

It has been suggested that, theoretically, e-mail could be used
to deliver and activate malicious code in mailers that would 
have some type of embedded automated services.  An example was 
given of "invisible" escape sequences which affect screen 
display or program the keyboard to do some malicious action when 
some key is "accidently" pressed.  This could be done through a 
file that remaps keys when displayed on a PC/MS-DOS machine with 
the ANSI.SYS driver loaded.  However, this only works on MS-DOS 
machines with the text displayed on the screen in text mode.  It 
would not work in Windows or in most text editors or mailers.  A 
key could be remapped to produce any command sequence when pressed, 
for example DEL or FORMAT.  However, the command is not issued 
until the remapped key is pressed and the command issued by the 
remapped key would be visible on the screen.  You could protect 
yourself by removing ANSI.SYS from the CONFIG.SYS file, but many 
DOS programs use the functionality of ANSI.SYS to control screen 
functions and colors.  Windows programs are not effected by 
ANSI.SYS, though a DOS program running in Windows would be. 

IMPACT: DoD personnel take unnecessary time and effort in 
response to a problem that does not exist.

RECOMMENDED SOLUTIONS: Do not forward a notice about the Good Times
virus to any other persons.  Normal policy should be to scan any 
executable file received from any source for malicious code.

Folks,
What's the quick and easiest way to have Pine default to a different
inbox location?  Say ~/.mail ?

Thanks,
Ken

Hmmm, what about automatic MIME type recognition?  Netscape
can already be configured (is by default?) to automatically
launch applications associated with a MIME type.  I can
think of a few areas of concern here, but of course the most
obvious is MIME type JAVA or JAVA SCRIPT!!!  Defining MIME
types for perl scripts and such is pretty dangerous too.  On
systems that support it, certain applications can interact
with the system and do damage.  For example, someone can
write a lotus macro that overwrites or deletes files, or
even writes a program and executes it when a .wk* file is
loaded.  Unix supports this functionality, and I believe NT
does too.

There are even more serious concerns in html itself!
There's some scary things going on on the web nowadays!
I've visited some pages that changed the pictures in the
buttons in my Netscape browser!  That's scary!!  I'm glad
this is just a hoax, but security is a serious concern of
mine, so I'd rather get alarmed and find out its a hoax than
find out the hard way that it wasn't!

Just my $.02

I'm not sure about your other problems, but you DO realize that the
command line options you are specifying can be set up in the
configuration, don't you?  Look under S)etup, C)onfiguration on the main
menu, and check out expanded-view-of-folders.  There is also a setting for
initial keystrokes near the bottom of all the setup options.  This would
allow you to simply type 'pine' at the shell prompt instead of 'pine -whatever'
Also, if you use csh, tcsh, or another shell that allows aliases, try
aliasing the command to something like this: 

alias	pine	'pine -d0'

whenever you type pine, you actually get pine -d0.  I've also done this
for pico since it has no way to set default options.

As far as your other problem, you could try using the G)oto command in the
L)ist folder screen.  I think it has to be enabled in the configuration,
but give it a try and see if it will work for you.

From the main menu, try S)etup and then C)onfiguration.  Look for a
setting near the top labeled inbox-path and set it to the path you want

Sorry I wasn't clear.  I meant when you're compiling it for general use on
a system.

Subject: Pine 3.95 binaries: huge?
Date: 14 Aug 1996 17:43:44 -0400
Message-Id: <4uthag$p1s@college.antioch.edu>

After building Pine 3.95 on BSD/OS 2, I found that the binaries were
HUGE compared to the previous versions:

Pine 3.95: 3568K    Pico 2.9: 616K
Pine 3.93: 1296K    Pico 2.7: 240K
Pine 3.91:  984K    Pico 2.5: 208K

Pilot 1.1 (old build): 240K
Pilot 1.1 (new build): 616K

I compiled with all defaults, and I'm reasonably sure I didn't
do anything special before.  What's the deal?
'strip' did not reduce the binary sizes at all.

Has this increase in size been everyone's experience?  What is it 
attributable to?  Am I missing something?

Mike

Dear Pine Gurus:

I have just created 200 new accounts for incoming students. The creation 
process went well using the root user name -or sudo for that matter. 
However, when jbob -fake username- tries to get into pine, the computer 
replies with:

pine cannot create /home/stud/jbob/mail

I am sure that I am missing something about rights for Pine but what? I 
could manually create all the mail directories with configuration files 
but I am sure that there must be a way of granting access rights to Pine 
so that it does it automatically the first time the students log in.

I am using Pine 3.91 under Free BSD 2.0.4.

Please, help me.

Desperado Pablo G. Molina

Paul, if your your 2nd collection is your newsgroups, and you
want to start (for instance) with comp.mail.pine, the following
command line string will invoke Pine and open that folder:

	pine -c2 -f comp.mail.pine -i

The only problem with that is (at least when I do it) that Pine
opens with *all* messages in that newsgroup, disregarding the
ones I previously marked "D".  However, when I next open Pine,
and get into that folder from the Folder List screen, the
newsgroup opens as it has before, with only "New" messages
showing.  I don't quite understand this, but if you can refine
the procedure, I'd be happy to hear.

I am using PC PINE on a 486/100 with a PPP. I have set the config
and can hear trumpet dialing up but I can never get into the inbox.
The error message reads "no inbox found". I set the path as:

C:\PINE\inbox	and also used the default it gives me which is
	just "inbox". Nothing works. Do I need to point to a dir
on the server (PPP)? Also when I try to compose a message I get
"cannot send mail without a remote folder open". I am using the 
values (SMTP, etc) as I do with my other mail programs but with
no success.

Thanks,

Rob -	<RB233>   robbee@metro.net

Hi

Could anyone give me further explanation on these options in the .pinerc
file (what to write, and the effect)? :

# Which category default print command is in
personal-print-category=

# Sets the version number Pine will use as a threshold for offering
# its new version message on startup.
new-version-threshold=

I have read the FAQ and even searched the Archives but I'm still 
unclear about how to accomplish this...

What I want to do is use pine to remotely collect mail from an ISP. 

I have changed the user-domain=, smtp-server=, inbox-path=, 
incoming-folders= to reflect this but with no luck...

Here's what I have in the .pinerc:

user-domain=wolfsong.com
smtp-server=mailhost.wolfsong.com
inbox-path={mailhost.wolfsong.com/user=andywolf}INBOX
incoming-folders={mailhost.wolfsong.com/user=andywolf}INBOX

This gives the error [Can't open mailbox ... invalid remote specif]

Any ideas? 





ah.

    Unfortunately, the answer to both your questions is, No.

    If you're using Pine under Un*x, you might be able to set up
procmail to do any uudecoding or unzipping for you automatically (if
you can reliably identify the file types in incoming mail).  From your
second question, I presume you are using Pine's built-in composer.  You
have the option of specifying a much more powerful editor if you wish
(vi, emacs, whatever horror turns you on), and that alternate editor
may have such a justification capability.

You mean reset .pinerc to its initial state?

I think you can accomplish this via:

yourprompt> mv .pinerc .pinerc.old && pine

(ie if you move the .pinerc file to another name [as a backup in  
case you want to go back later] and then start pine I think it will  
make a new .pinerc file with the default settings)

	???????

	All you have done is quoted what other people have said....

	Are you saying that your question/comment is in the subject line?
Are you really expecting people to help you with so little information?

    Yes, I am aware of this as well as of the shell aliasing options
you memntioned.  However, I deliberately start Pine in different ways
at different times for reasons of my own, so I don't want any one
particular way hard coded.  That's why I use the meta key capability of
my software so that I can start Pine the way I want at any one time.

    As for the G)oto option, it only works (at least with my
configuration) within one folder collection, so when I start Pine and
display the collections, the highlight is in the first collection, and
I cannot G)oto a folder in the second collection.  (I've tried it.)

If you have a printer attached to your machine at home, why not just turn
the freaking thing on and see if it works, instead of arguing about it? 
If it doesn't work, maybe you have some (s)etup (c)onfig or (s)etup
(p)rinter option changes to make.  Your system is using PINE 3.91 whereas
the latest is 3.95 but that shouldn't make a difference (someone correct
me if I'm wrong) because 3.91 also supports printing to a local printer
using ascii escape sequences.  It may not work if your using a win95
dialer, but if you post what your specific problem is, there's lottsa
people here who probably know the answer.

The PURPOSE is to PRINT!  Why is that so difficult to understand?  Print

soaked with ink.;-)

: Why doesn't Pine Help describe it?

It does ... it says Y means prYnt as in print.

: PS.  Does Pine have a FAQ?

Yes certainly it does.  And it also has context sensitive help screens, as
in Setup Printer for example.  BYE.

I have compiled Pine under Irix 5.3 from 3.91 to 3.95.  I cannot remember
exactly what the command was, but it was the one mentioned in  Pine 
instructions.  I think it was "build sgi".  If it is wrong, you can do a
"build help" to see which spelling is right.

You should consider 3.95 instead of 3.91.  There are some new features
since 3.92.

Cheers!

Ok, try Ctrl-N and Ctrl-P to change folder collections in the G)oto
screen.  I just checked all the way back to 3.91, and it works there.

Forget 2 or 3 years, the first time I saw that warning was on my BBS about
7 years ago!  It's been all over FidoNet, AOL, Prodigy, CompuServe, etc.,
etc., etc., etc...

It is a hoax everyone, it's not true, and think about it, how could you
possibly become infected that way?!


Later,

Try looking in Pine's Setup Configuration screen (S then C from its Main
Menu).  There you will see a very interesting looking configuration
variable called "inbox-path".  It even has contaxt-sensitive help to tell
you what it is for!  :-)

    This works manually, and I appreciate the information.  I am still
having some trouble getting it setup on a playback (meta) key.  When I
include the name of the first newsgroup in the second folder
collection, Pine complains about bad keystrokes "sci.lang" (the name of
my first folder in the second collection) with a cryptic message about
a possible missing comma.  Then it puts me at the G)oto prompt for the
second collection rather than automatically opening the newsgroup. 
Probably I need to do a little more experimenting with it.

No need to recompile; just set it in the global pine.conf file.

Good point!

On my SGI (Irix 5.3), Pine 3.95 is also about 3.5MB.

Subject: HELP!!


I just subscribed to the group, but looking for some help this afternoon.

Here's the story:

pinex.x.gz downloaded from ftp site
gunzip pinex.x.gz
tar -xf pinex.x gz
cd pine3.95
build clean
build a32


After those commands, I changed to the bin directory
and tried to execute pine, but NOTHING after about a minute a command line is
returned.

Pico and Pilot both work but the problem is Pine. 

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Brian

Editor is /bin/vi, invoked implicitly.
Machine is Solaris 2.5, Sparc 5, 32MB. My desktop; typically 3 xterms, 
1 www browser. Only server is SMTP (qmail ;). Load is low.

When this occurs, I'd quit Pine and restart, and it'll be ok.

Cheers.

Uhhh, that all sounds not very serious ...

If I read, how much knowledge you have in this area, how many spelling
errors you have in this document ... If I were decision maker in a company,
I'd prefer to get an account on Compuserve or America Online or whatever 
(what sounds more professional than your ideas) instead of getting some 
strange obfuscated services from you ... Definitively !

Sorry to say this ...

What does `file' say?  In particular, are the new binaries statically linked,
by any chance?

Matt-

I don't mean to get medieval on you, but if you have read the numerous posts
about filtering email you should see (or at least see that the devlopers
and others feel) that it's not the business of the mail client to do 
filtering to different folders, at least on Unix machines.  If you want to 
filter your email, use procmail (or Elm's filter, though Sven says thats 
become unsupported).

I say "...at least on Unix machines" because one could argue that on PCs where
one connects to a server and possibly downloads all their email, it may be nice
to have the downloading program seperate the email into folders based on
certain criteria.  I won't argue this point either way.

As far as killfiles/memorized commands for Usenet news, I asked the pine
developers about this and they said it was a feature they intend to add in a
future release.

It's my opinion that if you read more than a couple of newsgroups that receive
any traffic whatsoever, memorized commands alone won't be enough to make pine
worthwhile as more than a toy newsreader, though.

Greetings,

Has anyone used remote folders collections?

Can they share there experiences and what needs to happen to set that up?

Can anyone give a synopsis of the differences between the protocols?

I have two things that I would like to do. 

1)
I have two different Unix accounts in two different domains and I would
like one local copy of Pine to read the remote folders yet have it look
local. 

2)
I am also interested in setting up PC Pine and read both Unix account
folders rather than logging into one Unix account.



Can this be done?




Thanks in advance!

David Kafrissen

Subject: Macintosh Printer Problems

Message-Id: <4v2tl3$4ks@lace.colorado.edu>

Several members of our networked office, using Mac 7200 and 7100 machines and 
Pine v3.95 and Pine 3.93 (our mail server is a Unix box running these versions), 
have had print-through problems.  Only certain messages--or from certain 
senders--affect the printing.  The problem is that when using the 'Y' command 
and confirming printing, the computer simply hangs.

While not exhaustive, we have begun investigating and found some senders are 
using Microsoft Exchange.  Another might be using Eudora Lite.  Anyone with 
similar problems?  Any possible solutions?

Thanks.

We have had a similar problem using both personal LaserWriters and Networked 
LaserWriters from Mac 7200 and 7100 class machines.  Only some pine messages are 
affected, but when trying to print them, the machine hangs indefinitely; only 
way to correct it is to re-start.

In our investigations, we have come to realize that the senders of some of these 
messages are using Microsoft Exchange.  Anyone have a similar problem?

Greetings,

Sorry about the bother. I have figured out my problem. It is because my
mail domain is not complete so what appears in my sent mail folder depends
on which machine I log into!

Sorry about the trouble.

So the next question is how do I set the mail domain? I cannot look at ir
right now. Whenever I start Pine it give me an error that the mail domain
is incorrect.

Thanks in advance

I have the same problem but I figure it out. After 
reading the posting below. When I get into Pine
I get the error message that it had an incomplete 
mail domain.

Therefore depending on which machine I log into 
causes my sent mail folder to look different.

When I have some time I will look into how to set 
the mail domain. Is it easy to do?

Thanks

Paul,

Thanks for the prompt reply. I did play with the index-format
specification. I do not think that is my problem however. It was blank to
begin with.

Thanks

That, or compile your own pine binary (if you are using linux, or a UNIX
flavor on your home machine and are in a position to do this), and enable
ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM, then edit the from line (in config) to your real
address. This is what I've done, after using reply-to for a while (ti
works, but i had big problems with mail lists that confirm you're a member
before allowing your post through).

I have two questions regarding pine. Is there a way to make pine
automatically uudecode or unzip a text file received through email? I'm
using pine through a unix shell account and I can decode or unzip manually
from the unix prompt but I find that time consuming.

Next, is there a way to make pine automatically go through a message I'm
composing and "justify" the entire thing. It takes a long time going
through a document and doing every paragraph manually.

Thanks

My advice is to hire a writer/editor and a system administrator.
Expect to pay each of these at least $40K/year.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

I've already compiled Pine to override From: when I'm logged in as root,
but I was wondering if I can also override X-Sender:.  Not that it's
really a functional problem, but my X-Sender: ... shows up as root@interl,
but my ISP's head of technical support is the 'real' root@interl.net
(which is why I needed to recompile Pine).  I've tried adding X-Sender to
custom headers right after my custom "From: Jason Englander
<jasoneng@interl.net>", but it's not working that way.  Hopefully I can
get it to be "X-Sender: jasoneng@interl" somehow...

Thanks,

  Jason

Date: 17 Aug 1996 18:17:24 -0400
Message-Id: <ii.840319910@shellx>

I'd like to be able to pipe an HTML doc to lynx (e.g., a MIME 
attachement that I receive in pine).  Can someone tell me the
best way to do it?  Right now I'm saving the doc as tmp.html
and then doing `lynx tmp.html' but it would be much nicer if
I could just do something like `|lynx $stdin'

Thanks,
Nancy

When I use PICO (v2.8) from the shell, the ^O command
gives me the option to change the filename to which
the buffer will be written.

When I post an article to Usenet using PICO in Tin,
it won't let me write to any file other than ~/.article
(I want to save a copy of the article).  How come, and
how can I make it write to a different file?

Does anybody know how to get PINE to run as a dos window?  I am trying to
set up a mail server where people can telnet in and check mail, but on a
Windows NT 3.51 server.  If not does anybody know of another  
full-featured text mail/POP client for NT?

Thanks

Subject: How I cancelled my newsgroup article using pine (mostly)
Date: Sat, 17 Aug 1996 22:49:52 -0400
Message-Id: <Pine.SUN.3.95.960817223352.8722A-100000@loomis.berkshire.net>

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

I used pine 3.95, UNIX version.
 
Having searched via Dejanews and MetaCrawler (deep search) with
keywords 'pine news cancel' and finding little information, I 
reread the paragraph in the cancel FAQ that reveals the basics:
 
  << F. How are they issued?
        
        Cancel messages are sent out as a standard Usenet post, except
  they contain a "Control: cancel " header.  If a system that
  accepts cancels receives the message, the post with the specified
  message ID is deleted from that system.>>
 
After reviewing a number of cancel messages in newsgroup 'control',
I determined that 2 headers are necessary in the cancel post:
 
Control: cancel <message-ID>
Subject: cmsg cancel <message-ID>
(the <> brackets are necessary)
 
I posted a test message to newsgroup misc.test, looked at the headers
of my test-post, and copied its <message-ID> to my clipboard buffer.  
 
Then, for the cancel-post, I started another post to misc.test, and 
postponed it.
 
I suspended pine and edited the file 'postponed' in my mail directory
to insert the two headers, pasting in <message-ID> from my test-post.
 
I resumed pine and 'Compose', 'Continue', 'Yes' with the cancel-post,
which now contained the cancel headers.  After posting, I verified
that my test-post had disappeared from misc.test, and that my 
cancel-post was in the control newsgroup.
 
One could use 'Setup', 'Configure', 'customized-hdrs' 'A'dd to insert
the header Control: <message-ID>.  But then you have to remove the
Control: customized-hdr after posting the cancel-post.

Now that I've done it, it's obvious how I can cancel one of my
articles in a newsgroup using pine.  pine has such long message-IDs
that I'd hesitate to type them into the headers, but with a clipboard
to copy to & paste from, it's easy.  

It's easier still to use a newsreader with a 'cancel' key if you have
access to one.  If I've overlooked the obvious, please post easier
ways to cancel a news article using pine.

See RFC1036 (usenet), RFC822 (mail), and Cancel FAQ for background
information on headers and cancel messages.

It's been my understanding that this is not possible in lynx and
is one of (a variety of) reasons why lynx, for instance, is not
able to integrate with Emacs (such as w3, Netscape, others, do).
I look forward to being corrected about this.

If your modem software has a backscroll feature, mark the text and save, 
giving it a name, to a file on your hard drive.  Windows terminal or 
Telemate, for example do this.

You may have to increase the default size of the backscroll buffer or go 
in and out a few times to get it all.

If the message contains one uuencoded attachment, enable the pipe command
(in Setup/Config, if not already enabled), and pipe "|" to uudecode or
munpack.  

Don't know about unzip, since you would first have to munpack or uudecode,
then unzip.  Perhaps you could write a script called munzip to munpack
then unzip:
    munpack | unzip
and pipe to munzip.  (I'll leave it to you to try.  :)  Besides, there's
probably an easier way.)

I'll leave this for someone else.

  If Lynx as it is can't do that, you can always write a script
to do it for you. That's the way Unix works, isn't it?
Enclosed is a simple minded script for that.  Depending on your 
version of lynx, you may have to omit '-nolist' option. 


% cat lynxfilter

#!/bin/sh
trap 'rm -f /tmp/$$.*; exit 1' 1 2 15
IN=/tmp/$$.stdin.html
cat > $IN 
lynx -dump -nolist $IN
/bin/rm $IN

> pine news cancel

I wish Pine's Delete command deleted (cancelled) an article, and
reading an article marked it read.  The Pine developers have already
explained that the single state of news articles (namely read or not)
caused them trouble, when forcing mail and news into the same system.
I'd suggest there are other ways out than what was chosen: for
example, display only unread news articles when entering a newsgroup,
and have a command to toggle showing read articles also (and let the
same toggle work for mail, but default to showing all as it does now).

The thing is, cancelling one's own articles is an activity to be
recommended and made simple; it's a Good Thing for the net.  At least
on UNIX Pine, where we have authenticated the user by login, it should
be safe to allow cancelling.

Wah!
I eagerly read through (almost) every word of the 3.95 release notes,
and while I'm very happy with the large number of helpful updates,
the one I've wanted so much for so long still isn't there!

In UNIX mail and mailx, it is possible to engage an editor to edit
RECEIVED messages.  This is very helpful for cutting down on the
volume of saved messages.  Unwanted lines and lines full of headers
can be quickly deleted, along with abundant, redundant inclusions of
quoted messages.  You read, you edit, you save.  Bingo: megabytes
of unwanted fat removed.

Is this enhancement ever coming to the otherwise-now-perfect-PINE?

I am looking to start a business taht gives, and manges EMAIL address to

one time setiup fee.  You fax the business there Email...

I then checked with my provider they want $5,00 per month for EACH new 
Mail box.. this is way too much...  It would mean I would charge $10 per 
month and not be an intiseing to compnaies.

Another program needed.. I need to have any email with customers address 
automatically faxed to there machine.  In begining is okay to send it 
manually, but as business grows need it automated.. anyone have any 
ideas.

Looking for cheap costs effect soulitions...  provider reccomended

about this tyep of program??

Is it better to start my own server, and lease a line from provider?  
Costs and equipmetn needed to set upo own server.. and jsut use the

Your question is slightly ambiguous.

If you mean "Having received a message, can I forward a copy on to someone
else?" then the answer is "Yes, use the 'F' (Forward) command".

However...

If you mean "Can Pine automatically redirect arriving mail to some other
e-mail address instead?" then the answer is "No, this is not a function of
Pine or any other mail *reader*.  Instead you have to persuade the mail
*delivery* software used by your computer system to redirect the mail as
it arrives.  This is _probably_ done by creating a file called '.forward'
in your home directory containing the destination e-mail address.  Check
with your local Help Desk for information."

Cheers,

Yes.

Go to the Setup Configuration screen and set the "speller" variable to
your ispell command.  (You may need to include the full path to the
program if it is not on your standrad path.)

Under Irix (and maybe other OS') cutting and pasting with the mouse causes
pine to go justify crazy, and you end up with one big brick of text.  This
is because newlines are pasted as ^J characters, which Pine uses as the
Justify command.

So, I've made a few changes here and there to a copy of the source for
3.95, changing the ^J for Justify to ^\, which seems like just about the
only control character not used for something or other.  Also, the ^J
character now inserts a new line, so pasting works the way it should.  The
help text in Pine and Pico is also changed throughout to indicate the
changed key (I didn't look into changing the man pages or anything in doc/
though). 
	Would anybody be interested in this version of the source?  The
only problem is that I seem to be inept at making a patch file using diff.
If someone can give me a clue I'll post the patch to this group - it
should be pretty tiny.  Email will get to me fastest.  :)

Hi!

Is it possible to have more than one news group hierarchy in the same
newsgroup collection? What I mean, it would be nice to have one collection
name "PGP" with news groups comp.security.pgp.* and alt.security.pgp in
it.  I tried something like: 

PGP "*{news.host}comp.security.pgp.[] *{news.host}alt.security.pgp"

with and without comma, but without any success - Pine thinks, I have no
groups in such collection. 

Any idea? 

BTW  all groups are supposed to be on the same server.

thanks in advance

Assuming that the attachment comes as MIME type text/html
the following line in my .mailcap causes pine to "do the right thing."
 
 
text/html; lynx -force_html %s; \
           test=test -z "$DISPLAY" -a -z "$LYNX_VERSION"; needsterminal
           
The test clause says to use lynx if the DISPLAY variable is not defined
and lynx is not already running.  An earlier line in .mailcap uses netscape
if the DISPLAY variable is define.

Could someone please tell me how to get PC Pine working on PPP, 
especially the locations for any packet drivers etc. needed. I've been trying
to set it up for several days without success. TIA.

Hmm, do you save a mail by capturing a copy of your screen?
In that case you probably miss the command "save" -
and thus you deserve to get copies of those repeated lines.  ;-)

Seriously - RTFM!

okok I'll tell you how:
Press '?' to see the help page.
On the right you see this menu:

Operations on the Current Message
---------------------------------
V  View                 Y  Print
R  Reply to message     F  Forward
D  Mark for deletion      
U  Undelete (remove deletion mark)
T  Take Address into Address Book
S  Save into an email folder         <--------------  there it is!
E  Export as a plain text file
B  Bounce               *  Flag

So just use the command 'S' to save your mail.
Simple, no?  :-)

Hi, all--

As you can see by this post,  "to: comp.mail.pine" is listed where my name
should be.  Any suggestions on which switch to turn on/off?  I've played
with the setup/config, restored the defaults (I think) by deleting
.pinerc, and still I'm s.o.l.  Is this a 3.95 bug or an incompatibility
with my .newsrc, or what?

All email assistance greatly appreciated.

Eric

No.....

You want to EXPORT it if anything, not save it.  It ends up as a mail message
again otherwise.

Hi,

	I just put together a mailing list.  Is there a way to make it so

this but i don't know if it exists on pine.
	Please respond by email.

I'm pretty sure that one could use the `display-filters' option to do this.
The filter used to display the message would need to be fairly smart, but
otherwise there's no reason why it shouldn't work.

Or at least the ability to

1) select a region of the input buffer.
2) run an external command on the selected region.

pico can do #1 but can't do #2, from what I can tell.

Don't fear anymore. I just found this:

---Fwd---

This message is the "Good Times" Antigen message.  If you have recieved
this message, your system has been completely, permanently disinfected
from the "Good Times" virus.

You can now ignore any messages having anything to do with "Good Times"
-- including threads! -- because you and they have been disinfected as 
of this mailing!  Pass the disinfectant on ONLY to anyone you know to
still be "hung up" on this unfortunate Internet virus.

Subject: Problem Transmitting from "Notepad" to PINE

Currently I am composing letters on my IBM-PC using "Notepad", then 
transmitting these over the InterNet to a PINE program. Specifically :
I log onto the "shell" of my local InterNet provider, access their 
PINE program, and transmit the file from my IBM-PC to PINE. The 
software I use to transmit data is QL2FAXW. I assume their InterNet 
server is a Unix system.

PROBLEM : this scheme is works fine, BUT I am losing the CR/LF 
(carriage-return line-feed) commands at the end of each line of text. 
No other characters are lost - except the line feeds at the end of 
each line.

ATTEMPTED SOLUTIONS

1) I tried "Word Wrap" in Notepad on my IBM-PC. Doesn't fix the 
problem. I also tried deliberately putting in CR/LF commands in 
Notepad before the 80 character position on every line. Doesn't work 
either. As far as I can tell, the CR-LF commands ARE present in the 
Notepad file.

2) I tried using another wordprocessor on my PC (WordPerfect). Same 
problem as Notepad - the data get transmitted but the CR/LF commands 
on each line get lost.

3) I tried modifying my data tranmission format. The QL2FAXW software 
has an option which you can activate "change outgoing CR to CR-LF". I 
did this. Still didn't fix the problem.

4) I tried control-J (Justify) in PINE. Didn't help either. As far as 
I can tell, PINE isn't recognizing any CR-LF characters in the text it 
receives.

O.K. gang, I'm stuck.
Why is this happening?

Please reply to my home e-mail if possible : aussie@ptw.com

Thanks,
Pete Pollock

0.  Yes, BCC does exist in Pine (and has done for many, many moon).

1.  Put cursor on a header line of the message you are composing.

2.  Look at menu at bottom of screen and see that ^R (Rich Header) sounds
    interesting.  Type ^R.

3.  This expands the header section to reveal all available headers,
    including Bcc.

Cheers,

Yes, you can do this with Pine (I'm assuming you are asking about Pine as
this is a Pine information group, even though your question doesn't seem
to have been posted with Pine.) ...

When you are composing a message (original, reply or forwarding a message)
Pine by default shows you the headers it deems "most appropriate" for the
message.

Thus if you start composing a message whilst viewing a folder in an
"ordinary" folder collection you are shown e-mail type headers.  However
if you were reading a newsgroup in a news-collection you instead get shown
news type headers.

Whatever you are shown is _only_ the default: all the other headers are
still available.  To see/use them just put your cursor on any visible
header line and give the ^R (Rich Header) command shown in the menu at the
bottom of the screen.  This expands the header section to show ALL the
available header fields -- both e-mail type and news type.

For a message to be sent as e-mail the "To:" field should be filled in
(and also possiby the Bcc, Cc or Lcc fields).  For it to be sent as a News
message the "Newsgroups:" header needs filling in.  You can quite happily
fill in as many of these fields as you wish in order to send the message
to both mail and news.

Indeed later versions of Pine (3.93 onwards) offer you a choice when
replying to a newsgroup whether you want to e-mail the auther of the
article you're responding to, sned your reply to News, or do both.  Your
sinlge keystroke answer to this question will automatically fill in the
appropriate headers.

Cheers,

Mike Brudenell                                         <pmb1@york.ac.uk>

Message-Id: <4vb67t$k2s@mark.ucdavis.edu>

Question (and pardon if this is already in the faq-just tell me and I'll
rtfm):  How can I save parts of multiple messages (i.e., FAQ pt 1, 2, 3,
etc) and combine them into one text file?

I use the pico text editor.

Thanks.

Rather than Bcc:, use Pine's Lcc: feature. There has been a discussion of
Lcc: on this list over the past weeks. While composing the message, move
the cursor into the header and press Ctrl-R (rich header). This will
display both Bcc: and Lcc: lines. Move to Lcc:, and enter the name of the
distribution list (you must define this list in Pine's addressbook). This
will put the list's name into the To: line, and the recipients into the
Lcc: field, but the recipients will only see the To: line and not the
Lcc:. You may want to try first, by creating a distribution list that
contains only yourself, and maybe one or two friends.

I'd like to be able to send mail to multiple people, with each one receiving
the message seemingly addressed to himself alone in the To: header.  Is
there a way to do this with PINE?

Solution While-U-Wait:
Weed away those unwanted header lines from mail folders with Fefe's weed script:

	http://www.math.fu-berlin.de/~guckes/sed/#weedout

Usage:

	(1) Save the script text to file "weedout.sed" and then
	(2) Apply with "sed -f weedout.sed foldername"

Credit goes to the author : Felix von Leitner leitner@math.fu-berlin.de

I assume the script can somehow be worked in to PINE - anyone?

	Hummmm.....I wonder why you wouldn't read the FAQ first and upon
not finding the answer ask the question?  

	That aside.....

	When reading the message type V(iewAttch).  You will then see
one or more lines.  If the message is not MIME compliant, which yours
was not, you'd see only one.  Anyway, move your cursor to highlight what
you want to save and type S(ave) you will be prompted for a file.  Do
this for the next message...and when you answer with the same file name
from the first save you will be prompted for a(ppend) o(overwrite).

	Hope that is what you are looking to hear.

How can you setup pine to send out mail with an aliased email address
and not my normal email address. I have looked at the Setup
Configuration but can't find a place where you'd enter one in.

Any help appreciated.

Do you mean that you want the `From: ' line to say something other 
than your normal email address?  The answer depends on which Pine 
you're using.  In PC Pine for Windows, it's possible.  In Pine for 
Unix you need to recompile it so that ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM is not
commented out.

 -Nancy 

PS - I still thinking ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM should be the Pine default!

Sorry to all for the confusion.  Apparently I changed my configuration 
file and the result was that only the "Subject:" line would except key 
strokes.  Any attempt to cursor into the ----- Message Text ----- area 
resulted in an error message.  To add insult to injury, instead of 
postponing the message until I could figure out what happened, I sent it 
instead.  Well that's my story and I'm sticking to it.

I attempted to use the "|" (pipe) command while reading a message and got 
the following error message in reverse video [Command "|" Not defined for 
this screen.  Use ? for help]  I went to the help screen and the "|" 
command is listed as an option with no other information?

St Louis University is using a UNIX version of Pine 3.91.  I'm not sure 
this is the most current or if this is a bug!

Thanks to all those who answered the mail, and again, sorry for the 
confusion

	I'm not so sure I understand what Bill means by "aliased"
email address.  If he'd like the reply to go to a different account
he could use the "Reply-To:" header in the customised headers.

	Sorry, I feel that is a very *bad* idea.  I run the email
system for our Asia Region and many folks here use things like
Netscape Mail and other UAs which allow this as a default.  I'm getting
very tired of all the "undeliverable" mails that keep showing up.
I finally get everyone trained and all the clients working....and then
they hire a new group of people and the fun starts all over again!
The *worst* part is some people will subscribe to mailing lists with
their bad address!!!  Then try to get some of the lists to unsubscribe!!

	Regards,

I have noticed some interesting (and inconsistent) behavior in Pine,
concerning the message that is selected upon first entering a given
folder. 

I have multiple inboxes.  When I move between inboxes, Pine automatically
selects the last message in the inbox.  This behavior is consistent
regardless of the sorting variable I use.

If I move between folders (say, in my ~/Mail collection, the message
currently selected by Pine varies, depending upon the sorting criterion I
am using.

In my ~/Mail folder colection, if I sort by reverse date, Pine
automatically starts by selecting the first message in the folder.  If I
sort by date, Pine automatically selects the last message in the folder. 
I regard this as both sensible and desirable behavior, as the most recent
message gets selected first, regardless of the sorting criterion.

I used to have just the one incoming mailbox, sorting by reverse date.  To
get Pine to open at the first message in the mailbox (ie, that with the
most recent date), I used the "initial-keystroke-list" feature, and just
jumped right into my INBOX upon starting Pine.

Now, I have multiple incoming mailboxes, and so the initial-keystroke-list
feature is only useful for the very beginning of a Pine session, as in all
subsequent moves between incoming mailboxes, it jumps to the last message
in the mailbox.  This is a most undesirable feature, if you are sorting by
reverse date, as you always end up starting with the oldest message. 

My current solution has been to sort by date, rather than reverse date.
The ideal behavior would be if switching between inboxes corresponded to
the switching between folders in a folder collection.

Has anyone else noticed this behavior, or can anyone suggest a better
workaround than simply giving in to a different sorting criterion?

Regards,

David Cartledge

When I came in today, I had a new version of PINE on the server.  In
sending messages to one of my newsgroups I noticed a curious thing.
Usually my folder list has the form [no. of item, date, from name of
person, subject].  The form is still the same but when I send mail to my
group and it appears on my list it appears as: "To: misc.invest.stocks"
and not as my personal-name (i.e., David Bowles).  The personal-name in
config is correct.

Any suggestions?

Hi!
	we have encountered with a bug in pine 3.93 , we developed
a faxgateway choosing pine 3.89 as plateform for sending e-mail to our
faxgateway that was a UUCP host. In Pine 3.89 the UUCP address scheme i.e.
host!user worked fine but in pine 3.93 it does send the message but
sendmail returns with error (554 No ! in UUCP !). We are unable to rectify
it we used a shell script for sendmail path as well but it didn't work.

We will really appriciate you if you kindly provide us some suggsetion for
configuring our MTA (i.e. sendmail) for pine 3.93 to rectify this problem.
Thanx and Regards
Apollo Team (Working on first internet node in Pakistan)

In the Unix version of pine, use ^A to move to the beginning of the line
and ^E to move to the end of the line.

Frequently Asked Questions about Pine

  What documentation is available for Pine?
  
   The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
   online help. Additional documentation, including a User's Guide,
   Technical Notes, and information on where to obtain the software, can
   be accessed:
     * In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/
     * Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.
     * The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can also be
       read from within Pine by defining a folder collection (from Pine's
       MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to folder-collections
       and choose Add Value) as:
       *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/docs/[]
       
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  Who should I ask for help with Pine?
  
   If you need assistance with Pine, contact the technical support staff
   or computer help desk of your Internet Service Provider, school,
   university, employer -- whichever organization provided you with the
   email account on which you are using Pine. Due to the large number of
   Pine installations worldwide, the University of Washington cannot
   provide individual support services to Pine users.
   
   University of Washington Pine users, please contact your departmental
   computer support staff; or send email to: help@cac.washington.edu
   
   You may also be able to find the answer to your question through the
   Pine Discussion Forum -- see http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  Why does command X not work?
  
   Some of the Pine commands you may read or hear about have to be
   explicitly enabled in the SETUP CONFIGURATION menu, which is accessed
   from Pine's MAIN MENU, to be functional. For example, to be able to
   use the "Bounce" command, the following feature has to be checked:
     [X]  enable-bounce-cmd

   and to be able to use the "Select"/"Apply" operations, you must first
   check:
     [X]  enable-aggregate-command-set

     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  How can I filter messages into different incoming folders?
  
   Pine does not perform delivery filtering; that is the function of
   other programs, such as (on Unix hosts) "procmail" or "mailagent." For
   details on selection and configuration of such programs, see the
   Filtering Mail FAQ (by Nancy McGough) at one of the following
   locations:
   
   http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/mail/filtering-faq/
   faq.html
   http://www.smartpages.com/faqs/mail/filtering-faq/faq.html
   ftp://ftp.halcyon.com/pub/ii/internet/filtering_mail_faq.txt
   ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/mail/filtering-faq
   
   Once you have successfully set up your delivery filtering, you will
   have new mail arriving in several different folders, in addition to
   your INBOX. You can then access these folders just like any other mail
   folder. You can also define a collection of incoming message folders
   in Pine, through which you can then TAB to read new messages. For more
   information, see Pine's internal help on the enable-incoming-folders
   feature in Pine's SETUP CONFIGURATION menu.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  How do I define my own headers like Reply-To and Organization?
  
   From Pine's MAIN MENU, choose Setup, then Config. Move down to the
   customized-hdrs option and read the context-sensitive help screen.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  How can I have a signature automatically appended to my mail messages?
  
   From Pine's MAIN MENU, choose Setup, then Signature. The text you
   enter in the SIGNATURE EDITOR (new in Pine 3.92) will be appended to
   all messages you compose.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  How do I send a message to multiple recipients without showing all their
  names?
  
   In Pine's message composer, with the cursor in the message headers
   area, press Ctrl-R ("rich headers"). Then read the context-sensitive
   help screens for the Bcc: and Lcc: fields.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  How can someone without Pine decipher an attachment to a message I send?
  
   Pine uses the MIME Internet standard for attaching files to email
   messages. Any MIME-capable mailer should be able to "understand"
   Pine's attachments. If the recipient of your message with attachment
   does not have MIME-capable email software, they should be able to save
   the attachment to a file and then decode that. One freely-available
   program which can decipher a MIME attachment is munpack from Carnegie
   Mellon. It is available at:
   
   ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu//pub/mpack
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  Can Pine be used with a POP server?
  
   No. Neither Pine nor PC-Pine currently (as of version 3.95) support
   POP's offline mail model (wherein pending mail is pulled from the mail
   server to the local machine and deleted from the server). However, it
   is likely that this model will be supported, with a choice of either
   IMAP or POP as the access protocol, in a future release.

I use vi, and it most definitely has a formatting feature.  After typing

Setup -> Config -> mail-check-interval

on pine3.95 should do what you want.  The help even says:

	If set to zero, new-mail checking is disabled.

set your mail-check-interval and find out.

No, but neither can tin, so why are you using that?  Lurk on 
news.software.readers if you don't believe me.

	I second the request, and add another: some way of
purging the .addressbook. Even just being able to use the select
command and delete a bunch at once would help. As it is, I have
to sit here with my face hanging out while pine deletes one
single address, re-sorts the whole file (apparently -- and like
as not tells me I'm exceeding quota while it does, and maybe
hangs) and *then* (maybe) lets me take out one more.
	Even better would be to have it highlight all those
addresses that it hadn't seen, coming nor going, for say a year
....; or all those with a particular note in the comment field,
or all at a particular domain, or something.
	Any hope, pinebuilders??

Lynx's 2.5FM man page says:

OPTIONS
     At start up, Lynx will load any local  file  or  remote  URL
     specified  at  the  command line.  For help with URLs, press
     "?"  or "h"  while  running  Lynx.   Then  follow  the  link
     titled, "Help on URLs."

     -    If the only argument  is  '-',  then  Lynx  expects  to
          receive  the arguments from stdin. This is to allow for
          the potentially very long  command  line  that  can  be
          associated  with  the -get_data or -post_data arguments
          (see below).


among other things.  That means that stdin is already in use for something
- command line arguments which are longer than the terminal can accept.
So the currently method to do what is being describe is to pipe the
html document into a temporary file and then invoke lynx on that temporary
file.

I don't see any way around this due to the need for stdin elsewhere.

May I suggest that, in some future Pine version, you give the user the
possibility to add lines to the addressbook entries; for example, I'd like
to add a Postal, Phone or Fax entry.

Hello,

i think this is because you compiled pine with the debug Option "-g".
Change this in the "Makefile" and your pine will get to normal size.

Hi -- I am using PC-Pine (ver 3.95) on windows'95.  I am having trouble
sending and recieving image file (gif file).  Also, when I send/rcv a MS
Word file, pine views the file as text/plain format.  I have setup my
MIMETYPE and MAILCAP files to reflect those (Image/gif and Text/doc)
formats.  But, I must be missing some setup.

Can some one help me with the right setup for PC-Pine for send/rcv files
correctly.  I have checked the Pine's home page on MIME setups and those
did not help.
 
Thanks in advance,

-- Murtaza

What?  I used to be able to put /pop3 after a host name
{host/pop3} and use pop3 to download mail (pine3.91 on
linux).  I haven't used this in a while, though.  Why has
this been removed?  It worked fine for me then.  Oh well.

  Pine 3.95 prints to a desktop printer under Windows 3.1 with no trouble.
Under Windows 95, however, I can print any message up to a maximum of
~2500-3000 bytes in length.  When I try printing longer files (~4600
bytes) I get a printout of the list of messages in my INBOX along with all
of the corresponding escape sequences.  Anyone know why this is?

Subject: MIME encoding and attachment function as shell command
Date: 20 Aug 1996 09:46:01 -0700
Message-Id: <4vcq49$d6q@lex.zippo.com>

I am in need of a command I can include in a shell script, which will
MIME encode several binaries, attach them to a mail item and send to a
specified address.

I know that Pine is capable of performing this function, though as far as
I can tell, it can only do it interactively. I have the Pine source, and 
presumably I could do some reverse engineering to incorporate the 
appropriate code into a new program. However, I am rather hoping that 
this job has already been done elsewhere, as it cannot be such an unusual
requirement.

If anyone has any ideas as to

a) where I might find a program already written to do this job, or
b) whereabouts in the pine source I should start looking for my entry
 point (I was thinking of 'call_mailer' in send.c, but advice welcome)

I would be very grateful to be contacted at apg@ipl.co.uk.

Thank you very much.
Andy Graves.

  Hi.

 I would like to disable New Mail Notification w/out recompiling.
Any idea ?

 2. If I compile pine with the time interval 0, I suppose it will
not check periodically at all. But will it check if I go to last
msg and press Next ?

         Thanx,

           Jan

Put yourself as the To: recipient and the list as the Bcc: recipient 
(exposed with Ctrl-R).  This is the only way that is guaranteed to work, 
despite what advice you get about dummy fields and Lcc, which are not 
supported by all mailers in my experience.

It's a feature.
When you see "to: foo" then it only does this when it's from you.
Thus you know it's from you.  From noone else.  And you know your name, right?
So when you know it then why not show where you sent the message to?
Sounds like a good idea?  Well, that's what it does.  Why turn it off?

Doesn't the documentation explain this?

Btw, the From: lines reads "From: Eric <touch@umich.edu>" -
not "to: comp.mail.pine".  You should have checked this before you posted!

After what I thought was a successfull installation of Pine, it takes
about 2 minutes for Pine to appear for the user...take a look at this
process

$ ps -ef|grep pine                                       
    bman 12543 20971   1 20:31:00  pts/4  0:00 grep pine 
    bman 23786 25577   0 20:24:22  pts/8  0:00 [pine]    

I've never seen a process in brackets before, any suggestions.

Pine is driving me crazy--if I use pine as root, the permissions
on .pinerc are changed to 600 (guess that's okay) and the
ownership is changed from my username to root, so when I try to
use pine as an ordinary user it doesn't work....

Any cure for this?  It did not used to do it.

I use popclient -3 to get mail from a popserver and put it in one
of pine's incoming folders in my home directory.  This is in 3.94.
It operates independently of pine.

Does anyone know if there are plans for a future version of lynx 
to understand standard in (.e.g. `cat foo.html | lynx')?  What
character based browsers currently can get the html doc via stdin?
In the meantime, does anyone have a script that I (and others)
can use with pine to pipe an HTML MIME attachment to?

Thanks much,
Nancy

	IFF you want to use pine as root....then login as root.  I
suspect you are doing an "su".  Well, try doing "su - root".  Thus
you will really take on the environment of root.

Solved the problem, finally.  Check out the config entry:

	index-format

Mine had an entry which included the From: field (possibly to cure the
situation where you look at a letter you posted to a newsgroup and it has
replaced your name with To: field entry). 

Removing the entry (going with the default) solved the problem.

The Pine source code kit is available, along with pre-compiled binaries
for some platforms, by anonymus ftp from:

	ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine

The source kit has been bundled up into a "tar archive" and then
compressed.  Make sure you retrieve this compressed file using a binary
transfer (not ASCII/text).  Having retrieved it you will then need to
uncompress it, then un-tar it.

Cheers,

It hasn't been removed.  I'm running Pine 3.95 under Linux and I've got a
folder in my incoming folders section exactly like you just mentioned.

My ISP claims to have added new newsgroups.

How can I find out what they are using PINE (3.95)?

I don't see any features which relate to this.

Thanks

You should replace "pop3host.metro.net" with the actual hostname and
domainname of the computer that is running a pop3 daemon (server) and that
you have an account on.

Another suggestion for the Pine developers might be to have Pine support
compressed (or gzip'd) mail folders.

This is a frequent question.  Your name does show up in the index correctly to
us.  In other words this is what we see:

75 Aug 14 sin wei               Name not reflected 

where as you probably see:

75 Aug 14 To: comp.mail.pine    Name not reflected 

right?

If you want to see you name in the list instead of To: suchand such in the
config screen (M main, S setup, C config)  look for the feature index-format,
I think that it is towards the bottom.  Type A add and then type in:

STATUS MSGNO DATE FROM(33%) SIZE SUBJECT(67%)

this should do what you are looking for.

I do not think that there is any way to do what you are asking for.  There are
ways to show everyone or no one but not send to everyone but only show
personal names to the "sendee".  If there is I would like to know as well
though.

To clearify some of these messages up for you:

Depending on what version you are using there are different ways that you can
do this.  If you are using 3.93+ then you can do the Lcc way as noted in a
previous message to you.  If you do not have 3.93+ then you can do it by using
the Bcc way as noted but you have to place :; (a colon followed by a
semi-colon) in the to field.  If you do not place the :; the recipents will
still see eveyone elses name.

Hi,

Does anyone know if Pine supports the X-Reply-To (or Reply-To)
header?  I am trying to get Pine to use this header for the
address to reply to when I reply to mail, but I haven't
been able to get it to work.  Elm, zmail, rmail, and other
mailers do this automatically, but Pine doesn't.

Any help anyone can give me would be greatly appreciated.

Hi -- I am using PC-Pine for windows ver 3.95.  Everytime I rcv a gif file
pine responses by "Don't Know how to display Image/Gif Attachments; Try
Saving the file".  I have following entries:
in MIMETYPE "image/gif gif", and
in MAILCAP  "image/*;C:\Program Files\Accessories\MSPAINT.EXE"

Do I need to do any other set up?  How do I view the gif files or a msword

Thanks in advance.

Oh really?  Thank you very much.

'tin' and most other newsreaders have a feature which will prompt  
you about the new newsgroups, and ask if you want to subscribe to  
them.

If pine has a way to do this, I haven't been able to find it.

Having to manually subscribe to newsgroups isn't exactly what I  
hope for in a newsreader....

In article <3213CDD0.408F@ma.ultranet.com>, lsylvia@ma.ultranet.com says...

I am looking to start a business taht gives, and manges EMAIL address to 
business in Area.  I would give each an own email address added after my 
domain name.  In CA a business charges each compnay $5.00 per month and 
one time setiup fee.  You fax the business there Email...

I then checked with my provider they want $5,00 per month for EACH new 
Mail box.. this is way too much...  It would mean I would charge $10 per 
month and not be an intiseing to compnaies.

Another program needed.. I need to have any email with customers address 
automatically faxed to there machine.  In begining is okay to send it 
manually, but as business grows need it automated.. anyone have any 
ideas.

Looking for cheap costs effect soulitions...  provider reccomended 
gettting my own mail sorter, and it would sory mail out? Anyone know 
about this tyep of program??

Is it better to start my own server, and lease a line from provider?  
Costs and equipmetn needed to set upo own server.. and jsut use the 
providers line??

I am willing to pay $$ for the right soulutions that work for us.. Need 
answers Yesterday for have over 1000 companies taht are serious and in 
need of this service.  They watn WW Webb page linkage, and this would do 
it for them.. Also other compnaies with email address don't log in and 
check there mail regualry, and this would allow them to receeive there 
mail thru fax, and reply with terhe own computer..

EMAIL a reply and answer soon... THANK  LMS

[ Posted on 17 Aug 1996 21:11:46 GMT ]

        I have been using Tin 1.2 for about 3 months now and like its full
screen as opposed to Windows. But lately I have been noticing that once I
select a group of about 100 queries, it can take a good minute to load up.
If I go to TNEWS for the same newsgroup it will take only 5 seconds. Now I
haven't changed anything, I don't know if my ISP has. But is there something
that I could check, to speed up things once the group is selected? Starting
up and even reading the queries in the group seems find.

                                TIA

	It depends on "many" things.  You need to describe your
environment before anyone can really help you.

Hi John, There is no need to do anything I guess. I was told that everyone
else can see the name "John O. Stambaugh" <jos@gate.net>
but we can't see our own names. Take care, Jon.
PS If you want to see your own name then ask this group again but be
specific in the subject line. "HELP" does not get a whole lot of replies
compared to a detailed subject line. Ok? It is also the same in the
personals Usenet groups. If you don't put the city and area code of
yourself in the subject line then you will get almost no responses.

we've hacked our version of pine here (3.91) to do this.
1)  going into a folder that's been gzip'd unzips it first.
2)  saving into a folder that's gzip'd appends gzip fashion
3)  you can specify either "foldername" or "foldername.z" and
    if one of those exists, or neither exists, it does the right thing.
    if both exist, it complains.

happy to share this with the pine developers if they want it.

That doesn't solve my problem.......I want to know how to get
pine to *recognize* the Reply-to header when pine *receives* mail
with this header.  I am not trying to add headers to a message I
compose in pine.  I am trying to get pine to recognize the header
on incomming mail.

Lets say that someone from Germany sends me mail, and has a
X-Reply-To: header in his mail.  So the headers look like this:

From: johndoe@germany.free
X-Reply-To: janedoe@japan.com

Now, I go read the message in pine.  Cool.  Now I want to reply.  So,
I hit the "R" key for reply, and whala, the mail is addressed to
go to johndoe@germany.free.  Humm... johndoe put a x-reply-to
header in his mail so that MY mailer would send any replies to
janedoe@japan.com, NOT johndoe@germany.free.   I can't get
pine to recognize that when mail IT RECEIVES has x-reply-to
headers, to USE that header for the reply address INSTEAD
of the "from" header.

I've tried it with X-Reply-To: and Reply-To, and neither worked. 

Sure I could do it manually, but this is not for me.  I use zmail.
But I am writing a tracking system for mail, and all the mailers I
have tested understand the Reply-To: header stuff, but Pine doesn't.
Reason why I need it to work is because people will be getting mail
from my tracking system, with x-reply-to headers in the mail.  Some of
these people use pine, and they need pine to *automatically* say "hey,
this mail I received has a x-reply-to header, so if the user ever
replys to this message, I should send the reply to the address in the
x-reply-to header *instead* of the one in the from header".

Does that make sense?

Subject: IS MY INBOX GONE FOR GOOD? PLEASE HELP!
Date: 21 Aug 1996 14:50:36 GMT
Message-Id: <4vf7ns$86g@hecate.umd.edu>

While away on vacation, someone sent me some extensive e-mail consisting 
of many letters. I had not been regularly maintaining my inbox for a 
while, and of course it got very full. 

One day, my inbox crashed, giving me the message "core dumped", and 
locking me out of pine until I went off line and back in again. Well, 
when I did, my entire inbox had been eliminated, showing me an empty 
inbox with zero messages. In my Unix home directory, it shows that there 
is a large file called "core" now, which I downloaded, hoping that it was 
the inbox's dumped text. I was wrong, however, it looks like a bunch of 
garbage, completely indecipherable. I did save this onto my hard disc, 
however, but I deleted it from my UNIX account.

My question is: Does my old inbox exist anywhere in UNIX-land? I find it 
hard to believe that UNIX would have dumped it, being it is so 
intelligent, I would think it just put it somewhere. I wouldn't care so 
much, except that I really needed the info, and casnnot get it again. 

Any help would be appreciated.

John

	Your question is very vague.

	The simplistic answer is:

1.	Put your cursor on the header line which reads "Attchmnt:"

2.	Type the name of the file you wish to attach.

	Regards,

I am using 3.93 version of pine. I have noticed that it can't handle the mails,
while sending, of bigger size. I have tried to send the mails which are more
than 200 lines. It can't send them. The message which it displays is as follows
		sending mail 30% complete (something like this)
The if I see the process status, yes I use unix machine (IRIX), it shows two
sendmail processes. The pine does not complet the sendind, fcc operation. If I 
kill the two sendmail processes, the SMTP connection gets lost.

Has anybody witnessed this problem? Any solutions.

Hello, 
	I have used pine to communicate with people from overseas, and 
I was able to make a lot of friends through pine. But currently I lost
two of my friends' account, and was unable to reach them. I really want
to get back their account, at least I got their name and address. I really
hope that you can help me, please. I do not want to lose any friends. Pine
really acts as a communication medium for people around the world to get 
to know each other better. Hope to receive from you soon. Bye

Firstly a little bit of terminology... your INBOX is just a file
containing e-mail messages; it can't crash - only programs can crash.

In actual fact what will have happened is that the mail program you were
using to look at your INBOX (I presume this was Pine as you are asking
about this on a Pine discussion group?  You don't say!) crashed.

On UNIX systems a crashing program often dumps a copy of the memory it has

familiar with such files and debugging tools in tracing the problem that
occured.  However the core file doesn't contain your messages.

You should ask your local Help Desk for assistance.  They will be familiar
with how the mail programs are configured on the computers you use.  In
particular some sites move mail from the delivery area to other folders.

The Help Desk staff should also have the ability to rummage around on your
computers in likely places for your lost INBOX file and, if the worst
comes to the worst, possibly be able to restore it from a backup tape.

None of us at sites elsewhere around the world can do this for you.

> Any help would be appreciated.

Could I please put in a plea at this point aimed at others with problems
like this? ... Very often your local Help Desk staff are in a *far* better
position to help you than a collection of random people around the world
who know nothing about your site, let alone the computer systems in use
there.

Please consider asking your local support staff first about problems using
Pine.  This list is far more usefully used discussing bugs, new feature
requests and suggestions, etc.

Ummmm..... Pine certainly recognises and acts upon the "Reply-To:" header
field contained in the headers of messages you receive.  This is certainly
true of Pine 3.91 and later and, going off memory, earlier versions too.

Are you sure the header is spelled exactly like that (Reply-To) as against
something like "ReplyTo"?  If it is OK then perhaps you could send out
your question again with a copy of such a message attached in case anyone
gets a Flash of Inspiration?

As for X-Reply-To...  As I understand/remember things message headers fall
into two classes: official and unofficial.  All unofficial header names
should begin with "X-", wheras official header names shouldn't.  Reply-To
is most definitely an official header, and so should not be used as
"X-Reply-To" for fear that most mailers won't recognise it.  Perhaps a
quiet word with the person(s)  sending out messages with the header? 

Cheers,

Bad news, I'm I'm afraid...

Pine doesn't (yet?) offer a way of finding out about new newsgroups that
have been created. 

(Pine Team: It would be Truly Wonderful if it did one day ... Hint, Hint!

	Glad to hear you have their names and addresses....

	Suggest you sit down, write a letter, put it in the postbox
tell them your email address and have them email you.

Are you connected by modem or LAN?  Do you have ftp or can you attach your
server as a disk drive? etc. etc.

In echoing the suggestion in the post from Mike Brudenell earlier
today, this is a perfect example of the type of problem you that should be
addressed to the local system administrator or support team.  Not because
people on the list don't want to help, but because all the information
needed to solve the problem is not available to us.

this will not work for what you are looking for.  What will happen with this
is that you will not see the list in the Bcc field when you receive the
message but anyone and everyone in the Bcc filed will see anyone and everyone
in the Bcc field.  If you are not using version 3.93 or + then what you have
to do is but the DL in the Bcc field but ALSO you have to enter in a :; in the

I have acquired and compiled pine 3.95 and pico 2.9 on a Unix box
(NeXTStep on a Pentium).  In a console terminal window pico works as it
should, but when I dialup this machine via a modem, pico eats commands.
It will not recognize and Ctrl-codes except Ctrl-x (fortunately).  Pico
also also translates a <return> as a carriage return without a new line.
I have no trouble editing in pine whether at the console or over a
telephone line, the problem only accurs with pico via the modem on my
desk.  If I dial the university's modems and connect to the workstation
via the mainframe, pico behaves as it should.

I've tried a number of modem settings to no avail.  Is there perhaps a
compile option that I should change?

I'm sorry, we would resolve this problem if it were our problem. You don't
give us much information to go on here. If you get a bounce message, what
does it say? Does it say "no such user" or "no such host" or "host
unreachable"? Basically there are only two things that can cause a
message to bounce:

1) You have the address wrong (no such host or no such user)
2) The host is down or the link is down (host unreachable)
3) LinkNet is somehow not sending out your message. 

Number three is not the case. That leaves the other two. If you want to
forward a bounce message to support, we'd be glad to take a look at it.

The previous answer to the FAQ "Can Pine be used with a POP server?" was
indeed deceiving. While Pine does not (yet) support the POP offline email
model, it is (still) possible to access, with some caveats, a POP3 server
with Pine (for Unix, not with PC-Pine). That FAQ has been revised
accordingly, as the currently last item at
  http://www.washington.edu/pine/QandA/FAQs.html 
and
  ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs/FAQs.txt

Is it possible to disable the inverse-video display in pine?  On my

Hi all,

i have installed Pine version 3.95 to my
Sparc Classic with Solaris 2.4 in it.
Every time i open pine i get the Wellcome screen:
Do you want to receive Getting most of pine
via email. Screen tells that it will appear
just once but it opens every time.
When i answer No to receive question, pine tells
Incomplete mail domain khrsun and then the return
address you send may be incorrect ?
What do this all mean ?
Do i have to do some changes to Solaris conf files ?

Mika

This is a bug that was introduced with some last minute changes for
Win95 support :(

It will be fixed in Pine 4.00, but I'm not sure if we'll take the time
to release a fix before then.....

Dear Pine: Your system has been great but I can't seem to get through to
other people via e-mail. Is there some sort of virus in pine or what? What
causes this shutdown? Thanks, Norman.

I have just tried to use PC Pine 3.95 and have a simple question.  We are
using HPUX 10.01 as the imap server.  How can I configure the inbox-path
and folder-collections so that they change for different user ids?  To get
them to work I used
inbox-path={tiger.cuc.claremont.edu}/var/mail/brucep
folder-collections={tiger.cuc.claremont.edu}/users/brucep/mail/[]

Of course this will not work if you change the user id when you log in as
anything other than brucep.

	Not entirely.....but mabye:

          FEATURE: assume-slow-link
 
This feature affects Pine's display routines.  If set, the normal
inverse-video cursor (used to highlight the current item in a list) will be
replaced by an "arrow" cursor and other screen update optimizations for
low-speed links (e.g. 2400 bps dialup connections) will be activated.
 
	Is helpful?

I would also like such a feature very much.
Especially an ability to remove attachments from received messages.
I often have messages I want to keep for the text in the message,
but "have to" delete because it contains a huge attachment that I'm not
interested in any more.

    It means that the message was addressed to you personally, rather

Today, I received a BinHex 4.0 message.  The $64 question is how to read
the attachment.

My platform is Digital Ultrix and Pine 3.95.  Do I have to make an entry
in /etc/mailcap?

Thanks in advance.

    Most Un*x-like systems have a program called, strangely enough,
'vacation', which is actually independent of any particular mail
program you use.  When you run vacation, it will create a .vacation.msg
file for you.  See if it is on your system.  As such, it has nothing to
do with Pine.

  Do you think it would be possible to write a sub-program for Pine which 
would read incoming mail, recognize Distribution List names from the 
subject line and automatically mail out to all on those Dist. lists? I 
have been told Eudora Pro and Pegasus have similar features.

Take mimencode, mail and your favourite shell.  Write a script that
somewhat resembles the following pseudocode:

foreach i ( files ) do
  mimencode $i > $i.mime
od

mail receiver < *.mime

This, of course, does not work as such, but I think you get the
point.

Hi! I'm a student at Griffith University (Australia) and I was wondering 
if you can help me locate an old friend of mine.  I have been sending 
e-mail messages to my friend who recently transferred to Texas through 
this address : fvillamayor@msc.com  However, the postmaster@msc.com keep 
on sending me messages that say "bad address-user unknown."  If you can 
locate him kindly send him my e-mail address : s415855@student.gu.edu.au
Thank you very much for your help and thanks for trying!!!

I've discovered that I can use vi as an alternative editor in pine,
using it when I wish.  With vi running I can export specific lines
of text to a file; I can also run a command and have the output of
that command inserted into the text.

The command for the first is :x,yw filename (where x and y are line
numbers).  The command for the second is :r !cmd (where cmd is the
command you want to run and whose output you want in the text).

One of our sites has a Novell Server networked with an adjacent Unix
server. Users on the server can log in to a session on the Unix server.

The Novell Server has WFWGPO but they ask me "what do we have to put in
.forward to have mail redirected to MSmail.  Likewise is it
easy to send mail directly from MSmail to the world." 

The Unix server is connected via uucp to another server with Internet
access, and users of Pine on that server can send and receive mail via
the uucp link. But how to get the mail from/to MSmail?

As I am mostly a Unix person and not much a DOS/Windows/Novell person I
have not got a clue. Can someone out there help, even if to say there is
not enough information to give an answer?

I'm using pine 3.91 for unix.

How can I change the address in the FROM: field?

I need that the FROM: field change my default address (alberto@risc) to
my internet address (acarden@risc)

Thanks in advance for your help

I usually pipe my mails to

	a2ps -nH -nn -ns -p -1 -B -F10 | lpr

Then again - I hardly ever print anything.  ;-)
It's worth to take a look at a2ps - it has many options!

I'm having difficulty understanding the exact purpose of "sent-mail"
funcltion.  Why do I need to keep my "sent-mail" ? Just clutters up and I
have to delete them all eventually. Thanks.

I know I may be missing something obvious, but I haven't been able to
figure out how to configure PINE to use multiple address books.  The
documentation says it can be done, but doesn't seem to tell how to do it.
Any suggestions, either how to do it or where I should be looking?

	If you'd take the time to go to the setup/config you could
read the following:

         OPTION: Default-FCC (File Carbon Copy)
 
This value specifies where a copy of outgoing mail should be saved.  If
this is not a path name, it will be in the default collection for saves.
Any valid folder specification, local or IMAP, is allowed.  This default
folder carbon copy only applies when the fcc-rule-name (see later in this
configuration screen) is set to use the default folder.  Unix Pine default
is normally "sent-mail" in the default folder collection. PC-Pine
default is "SENTMAIL" (normally stored as SENTMAIL.MTX)
 
To suppress saving of outgoing mail, set: default-fcc=""
 
	It seems to do a credible job of explaining the purpose *and*
telling you how to turn off the feature.

	Amazing what the *help* screens will reveal....

Subject: two lines which repeat

Message-Id: <4v7v2j$o1n@ns1.thpl.lib.fl.us>

When I scroll through a message and then capture it to save in a word
processing prgram, the two lines repeat.

This is nice when I am reading the message (although I don't need it or
really want it) but it is very irritating when I am saving the message.

Is there a better way to save message to word processing programs like
Word or ClarisWorks that will not have this problem or can I set an option
to not repeat the two lines when I scroll down to the next page.

Thx

I am getting overloaded with e-mail from Japan because I subscribe to the 
mail list of my favorite Japanese pop music star. Only problem is, all 
incoming mail is being typed using iso-2022-jp!!!!!!


I was wondering if there was some way I could decipher or decode 
iso-2022-jp code using PINE in order to render it into either its Kanji/kana 
equivalent or into some for which is readable in English???? Or do I have 
to go a different route?

Q.	What platform are you using for pine?

Q.	Do you have the fonts necessary to display iso-2022-jp?

Pine.  How do I convert IMAP ro MAPI or are there any other methods to 
use these two products.
Thanks in advance.  <:

That's an easy one, you can either add it through setup/config, or add
the following to your .pinerc file:

address-book=.addressbook1,
        .addressbook2

I can not help directly with your problem, but this is how we use mail in
our organization.

RS-6000 runs SMTP
UUCP gateway to internet
AIX users run Pine

Netware 4.1 server runs Mercury 1.22 (SMTP gateway for pegasus mail, works
on 3.x also)  DOS/Windows users run pegasus mail. 

Besides the low cost, IMHO Pine is the best email program for unix and
Pegasus is the best email program for dos/wintel world.  Mercury (by the
same author as Pegasus) hooks them both together.

I can't seem to get the ^^ feature to engage.  I've set the
"preserve-start-stop" items in my configuration setup, but I still have to
use ^K to delete line by line while my screen scrolls S-L-O-W-L-Y line by
line as it deletes.  Any ideas on why Ctrl-^ isn't working?

No.  Think about it:
Pine could only do this while it is running.
When you are away then you dont start pine (do you? ;-).
As it won't run it cannot take action on incoming mails.
Thus pine is not the right tool for it.
QED.

Btw, "vacation" is a program - not a file.
However, it creates files, namely $HOME/.vacation.msg and $HOME/.forward.
Thus the program that receives the mail (the MTA - mail transfer agent)
will know what to do with new mail.

WARNING:  Do NOT use "vacation" if you are subscribed to mailing list.
Its a terrible nuisance to receive auto=ADsent mails from people who do
not even read their mails and thus cannot take action upon this.  :-(

Good luck.  You could get and install `mcvert', and add the following to
your mime.types file, if it's not already there:

application/mac-binhex40       hqx

Then add something like:


application/mac-binhex40;	mcvert %s

to your mailcap, but then you're just going to get to see whatever document
was `wrapped' (BinHex is kinda like `uuencode' -- once you've undone that
you're generally left with a binary file that you then have to figure out
how to interpret).

More than likely, but you're probably still not going to be able to read
what was sent.

Subject: Help on installation of Pine on AIX


     Maybe I'm missing something simple, but I thought that the following 
     commands were all that are required to deal with the pine-info.a32.Z 
     Pine archive file:
     
          Machine:       IBM RS/6000-560
          O/S:           AIX UNIX v3.2.5

The Pine Information Center (at http://www.washington.edu/pine/) now has a
searchable full-text index of all of its documents; select "search" near
the top of its homepage.  To construct the most effective searches, please
look at the available options.  This addition is still somewhat
experimental, but we hope it will be useful.

If your INBOX is on the same machine as you, find it and use 'ls -l' to list
the size of the file.  Likely places to look for your INBOX would be:

	/var/spool/mail/bizz
or
	/usr/spool/mail/bizz
or
	/var/mail/bizz


If you can't find it, ask your administrator where your mail `spool file'
is located.

Once you find it, use the ls -l command and check the size.

Now send yourself some email (or have a friend send you some), wait a while,
and then check the size of the file.  If the size hasn't changed then the mail
isn't even getting to you.  If the size has changed, but you can't see the
new message when you enter pine, then it's a problem with your INBOX.

If it turns out that the size of the INBOX changed (increased) but you 
can't see the new message then ask your system administrator to look through
the file with a tool that can spot control characters and other characters out
of the normal printable range.  `less' or `od -c' should work.  The sysadmin
should be looking for out-of-band characters in the email headers of the
various messages in your INBOX.  If you find any, that's more than likely the
problem.  You'll need to use an editor or command to delete the characters
from your spool file.

If all else fails, ask your admin to rename your spool file, and try sending
yourself another message.  A new spool file will be created for you, and from
then on you should be able read the messages that get appended to that file.
To view the messages in your old spool file, use a command like `more' or
`less'.

I'm running Netscape's News Server 2.0 on an NT machine, and
running PC Pine 3.91, 3.93, and 3.95 on various client machines
throughtout our labs, desktops, and kiosks. The news server hosts
password-protected newsgroups. Everything works correctly when
accessing the server with a netscape navigator client.

The problem is this: Pine can access the newsgroups fine. The
user gets a name and password prompt upon entering a password
protected newsgroup, and reading messages works fine, but posting
does not. When I tried to post a response into the newsgroup,
I was prompted again for a name and password, but the name field
was full of garbled characters. When I entered the correct name
and password, I got two beeps, then an error message at the bottom
reading: Error posting message: 500 What?

Anyone have any ideas? Is password-protected newsgroups a standard,
or is this a Netscape custom extension? Any chance that this feature
might be supported? Anyone know what 500 What means?

Please CC any responses to email.
Thanks

Hello!

We have recently switched our mail server, and we plan to use PCPine for
our email client. 

So far we have managed to get eveything in PCPine to work with our new
IMAP server. The only thing that I cannot get into through PCPine is my
addressbook on the server. Is this even possible? or must every machine
have a unique addressbook? I've tried renaming the addressbook on the
server (using unix pine) and editing the .pinerc but I haven't had much
luck.

Let me know if you have any suggestions,

Thanks in advance,

Subject: pine.conf and location of sendmail binary
Date: 22 Aug 1996 19:26:06 GMT
Message-Id: <4vic8e$ml9@mule.fhcrc.org>

I installed Pine, tried to send a message, and received an error to the
effect that Pine couldn't find /usr/lib/sendmail.  Aha! I thought, I
know what the problem is:  I've moved sendmail to /opt/local/sbin.  So
I created /opt/local/lib/pine.conf, consisting of the single line:

sendmail-path=/opt/local/sbin/sendmail

Tried sending the message again, and Pine (apparently) sent my test
message just fine.

But in fact, Pine is actually tossing mail into the bit bucket.  Copies
are saved to sent-mail, of course, but the message itself vanishes.

I've run Pine under truss and stared at the output.  I can see the call
to /opt/local/sbin/sendmail.

I hard-linked /usr/bin/sendmail to /opt/local/sbin/sendmail.  Same
problem.

I then removed /opt/local/sbin/pine.conf.  Bingo!  Things work again.

OK, so is this a bug or am I missing something?  And can anyone
describe the details of how this fails?  Clearly,
/opt/local/sbin/sendmail gets called ... but it tosses the message,
instead of sending it.  I don't understand how this can be --
sendmail's behavior at this point should be unrelated to any weirdness
on Pine's part.

Pine 3.95, Solaris 2.5.1

Attached are entries from syslog.  The first illustrates the failure

Killfile support is on our to-do list, but I don't know when we will
get to it.  I remember we considered it for Pine 3.92 but decided it
was more work than we wanted to tackle then.....

Filtering actually is a completely different question.  It is much
more efficient to handle filtering before final message delivery.  I
certainly wouldn't be happy if Pine spent a few minutes sorting my
incoming mail when I started it up ;-)

With IMAP, your incoming folders can all be on the server.  This means
that with a delivery filter, your mail can already be sorted into the
correct folders when you connect.

I'm not convinced that a simple killfile mechanism is enough either.
But that's another discussion... ;-)

You'll probably need to wait until Exchange supports IMAP, which is
planned (both server support and a MAPI-IMAP driver).

Remote access to addressbooks is a high priority, but not yet possible
(except by mounting the Unix disk as a remote file system via SMB or NFS.)

Some communication s/w or h/w devices "swallow" certain control

If your pine program is running on a machine that runs dos/windows, it's
pcpine (a version for pc's); if it's running on unix (even if the version
of unix is running on  a pc, as is mine, FreeBSD), then it's unix pine.

You can get an explanation of each of the options in the configuration
menu with the help key (maybe ? or something like that).  If you don't
know what they are talking about, just leave it as is.  default-fcc is
the location of the copy of a message you send (the file carbon copy?).
I have this set in my pine configuration file to the current mail folder,
so that I keep mail on different subjects (or from different groups)
together whether I get it or send it.

Hope that helps.

Hello World,

I've just subscribed to this newsgroup and I have a question.
I'd like to replace elm with PINE and I wonder is there any known

about UNIX PINE (HP-UX 10.x exactly)

Any response would be greatly appreciated.

I am assuming that what you want to do is exit from a message and enter into
the list of folders?  If so when you are in the message just type a L.  If you
wish to leave  a message and enter into the index of other messages in the
folder type I.  This is also assuming that you are using Unix pine.  I don't
know if it is different in PC pine.

Message-Id: <DwLuw2.oLM@undergrad.math.uwaterloo.ca>
Date: Fri, 23 Aug 1996 19:16:46 GMT

   Hi.

 I just noticed that Pine 3.95 doesn't add the "/" ('\' for
dos users) in the Tab-Completion in "Save" command.

 E.g. I have folder ~/mail/personal/grandma
 and when I try to save mail from inbox, and type per<TAB>
it expands to "personal" instead of "personal/".

   Is that a planned "fix" ?

         Thanx,

                Jan

While holding down the shift and control keys, hit the 6 key twice. You

Workaround:  Turn the feature off.
Then you won't have to worry about it.

  If you can display Japanese characters in your terminal
(e.g. Kterm for X window or terminal emulators running
in MS-Windows/DOS/Mac with Japanese support) and you use
PINE on a Unix host, you can set display filter(Setup - Config
menu in Pine 3.92 or later. I noticed that you posted this
with Pine 3.91. You'd better ask your system admin. to upgrade
it 3.95 ) to automatically
convert ISO-2022-JP to whatever local character set you use
for Japanese. You can find out where to get the converter
by reading CJK.inf by Ken Lunde available at

For some reason, Pine is unable to update your .pinerc file.  Correct
that and the problem should go away.

Try ctrl-shift-^, that may help.  Otherwise you will have to configure your 
terminal emulation program, ie the program you use to connect.

Here's the scenario:

Pine_3.95 and Pico_2.9 code compiled and running in NeXTStep 3.3.  In a
console terminal window, editing in both Pine and Pico works fine.  Over a
modem, while Pine still works as advertised, Pico has enough problems to
render it worthless.

- Only a few Ctrl-codes are recognized.  Luckily Crtl-X is one of those.
The others simply pass ANSI characters to the screen, diamonds, arrows,
faces, etc.
- The keyboard characters are recognized but a <return> produces only a
carrage return but no new-line

The problem isn't with the modem.  I can dial up this machine and Pico is
broken.  If I then telnet to another machine and telnet back to the first
machine, Pico will now work fine.

Should Pico be recompiled with a different setup?

Any suggestions would be welcome.

Why don't you try yourself, to begin with? On my system, the command
'man filter' gives seven screenfuls of information.  Try it.

I'm running Pine 3.95 under Linux, and it's just my girlfriend and I using
the system.  I have no problems, and haven't in a long time.  If I log in 
under her account, Pine 'can't save configuration in
/home/mygirlfriend/.pinerc'.  She owns her .pinerc, and no matter
how I chmod it, it still doesn't work.  There are also about 15 temp 
pinercxxxxxx files in /tmp. 

Any ideas?

Message-Id: <JENELLE+-2308961526200001@centris.pharm.pitt.edu>

Hey All,

The University just upgraded to 3.94, and I am having some difficulty with it.

1) I can *ALMOST* post to newsgroups, but when I try to send it off, it
tells me that no NNTP Server has been designated (I'm using NewsWatcher to
post this).  Now, the reason that I can read from Pine is obviously thata
server has been designated.  What to do? 

2) Can't view a GIF file sent to me as an attatchment.  I think that it's
because I'm not designating the viewer properly, but I have the paths down
correctly (I think) for mailcap and mime.  The "Help" response says that
it's not necessary to name a viewer, but it doesn't work with (e.g.
"Image/GIF) or without ("No Value ...") a name.

3) My sent-mail folder is now saving my sent mail under my name, not the
names of the people that I sent the messages to.  This means that in some
cases, I have to look through a bunch of the message bodies to find a
message that I sent.

Hope that someone can help.

Thanks in Advance,

Matt

  Binhex is the macintosh analogue to uuencode. It is generally used to
encode 
  applications, archives, and non-ascii documents (ex. MS Word) which
will
  likely only be useful on a mac once they are decoded. There is a unix
program
  called 'mcvert' which will decode binhexed files. It can be obtained
from

      http://www.shsu.edu/tex-archive/tools/mcvert/

  Or any other CTAN (Comprehensive TeX Archive Network) site.

It is my understanding that any valid address in the To: field will

which this is not true, I'd be interested to learn of them.

To the best of my knowledge, arriving mail never has a Bcc: field at

    Pine does not filter incoming mail itself.  You have to use some
external program which filters the mail as part of the delivery process
before Pine opens it.  You did not say what system you are using Pine
on -- Unix, VMS, DOS, etc.  It makes a difference.  If you are using
Unix, probably the two most common programs are procmail and filter.

    Again, it make a difference what system Pine is running on, which
you did not specify.  If you are using Unix, there is a .forward (note
the leading period) file you can create, or procmail could do it for
you.

    If you have a WWW browser, browse my home page, follow the link to
the Pine section, and take the link to Nancy McGough's pages.  She has
a lot of valuable information on mail filtering and processing.

If you are on a Unix host, you could use the shell with another mailer
to accomplish this.  E.g. with csh and BSD Mail, you could do something
like

  % foreach a (`cat address.lst`)
  foreach? Mail -s "Desired Subject" $a < outbound.msg
  foreach? end

Bear in mind that for large lists this could really hog resources.

	The PGP (pretty Good Privacy) program has already been
integrated, via several methods, with Pine. Some of them are set forth on
the PGP-Users Mailing list home page and there is also a very good
program which marrys the two called MKPGP.

	Take a look at http://www.rivertown.net/~pgp, or http://www.

I don't have the answer, but I have a similar problem.  I am clueless as
to how to solve it.  Perhaps someone would tell us how to configure it
from the start?

I am assuming that you have read the other replies to this message.
Although I do not know exactly what the :; stands for and etc., but it does
work.  First of all DO NOT just put the list in the Bcc field as noted in
another reply.  A Bcc field does hide the list from anyone hows address is in
the To field but EVERYONE in the Bcc field will see everyone else in the Bcc
field unless you do put in the :; in the To field.  If you are using Lcc You
do not have to put anything into the To field.  When done correctly Pine
should automatically enter in the list name followed by the :; in the To field
for you.  This way when the people receive the message it will say:

		To: distribution list name
instead of:
		To: Undisclosed Recipients

Hope that helps a little.

Actually, you need to invest in a good spell checker, and a dictionary.

Then maybe you should take a course in English grammer, and punctuation.

That is the best advice I can give you if YOU want to go into business.

Many people find it extremely handy to be able to refer to old messages they've
sent, to check to make sure they replied to a message, etc.

You don't.  Just set

	default-fcc

to

	""

in the Setup -> Config screen, and pine will quit saving outgoing email for
you.

I'm in hot water untill I can find out why a process is in brackets.

# ps -ef|grep pine

    bman 24131 12554   0 13:55:21  pts/3  0:00 [pine]   

It's taking over a minute for the program to appear.

Go to the setup screen and set the "preserve-start-stop-characters"
feature. That should solve the problem.

Greetings,
How do I cut and paste between two different documents?  ^K and ^U seem 
to work only within the same document.  I'm using Pine on a Unix machine.
Thanks.

Can you be more specific?  I've looked through the setup screens &
couldn't seem to find the line that controls this feature.

Well, thnx for the answers. a2ps seems to be good for start (at least
it's "Out of the Box" solution).

I was tring to pass some arguments to the printing command, i.e I want the
header to include the subject or the author etc. Tried few notations,
Pine's "filter" notation, %s etc notation, none have worked, any ideas ?

Can Pine at all "send" variable to commands like Print, Pipe etc. as it
can through Pine-Filters ?

Thnx,
  Naor

Subject: Pine 3.91 and Solaris 2.5 behaving oddly
Date: 23 Aug 1996 20:49:30 GMT
Message-Id: <4vl5gq$bmi@news.more.net>

Hello everyone,

I recently upgraded my freenets from Solaris 2.4 to Solaris 2.5.  I performed
a fresh install of the OS instead of an upgrade.  I recompiled gcc 2.7.2, and
recompiled pine 3.91.  I am now experiencing some strange behavior in pine:

1) Users will have .pine-interrupted-mail files, 0 bytes, created in their
   home directories with permission 000, when they are abruptly disconnected
   from the system (damn modems).  Pine later complains about the permissions
   when the user tries to resume the mail.

2) I have had unverifiable reports that pine freezes in the compose screen.

I do not know if these two events occur at the same time.  I would appreciate
any brainstorming anyone cares to do.

Regards,

David K. Drum

I've been a faithful user of TIN newsreader for several years & I'm trying
to appreciate the value of an "all-in-one" package like Pine 3.95.  Is
there a way to "catchup" (i.e. a global delete command) in any one
newsgroup without having to individually delete each posting?

TIA.

Has anyone figured out why this message occasionally appears when exiting
Pine even if you have no new mail?  Sometimes I get it and sometimes I
don't.  When I do receive the message, I go back into Pine but never find
new mail, so I exit the program and the message disappears. 

Another one of those random things?

	I just built pine3.95 on an old RS6000 using AIX 3.2.  I find that
I can read mail just fine if I'm an ordinary user, but I can send mail
only if I log in as root or the superuser....  I probably need to set
something in a configuration file, but can't find the info.  Any
suggestions?

	Thanks for your help.

After about using Pine Mail for over two years, I checked some of my
folders using the vi editor.  Obviously, PINE saves each message including
the full headers.  

Is there an easy way to configure PINE not to save the 'Received: '
header?

Thanks in advance.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Mainly as a test - because I'm already using popclient, I was wondering if
there was a way to pass the username and password for my 'POP3 Mail'
folder.  When I select this folder:

incoming-folders="POP3 Mail" {mailhost.interl.net/pop3}INBOX

...I have to manually enter my username and password (which is a major
pain in the arce to type repeatedly - one of those alphanumeric half-caps,
half-not ones).  Is there some 'dotfile' I can use or can I add something
to .pinerc to automagically pass my username and password?

Does anyone know what's going on behind the scenes when the message <Busy>
appears at the bottom of the screen?  I've had it happen a couple of times
where I was stuck for over 15 minutes waiting for the message to disappear
so that I could continue reading mail or news.  This seems like a long
time for a system to be "Busy" so old Curious George here would like to
know what might be happening during this time.

The correct command is control+shift+6 (all 3 keys at the same time) ... 
if that doesn't work on your system try Esc Esc ^ (that's escape, then
escape again, then shift+6).  Either one of these only sets the beginning

The procedure as described above and in the FAQ also does not work completely 
for me using pine 3.91 and sendmail 8.7.5.  We're still using 3.91 on our
main hosts until a later version of pine is more stable.

When I go through the procedure outlined in the FAQ and above (put :; in the
To: field and put the other recipients in the Bcc: field) I get:

1) the message is delivered to all the people in the Bcc: field, with a
To: field of

	: ;

or
	: ;@hostname.FQDN

the Bcc: field is (of course) not part of the delivered headers.

2) the message *also* bounces, and postmaster and I receive a copy, with
sendmail complaining:


   ----- Transcript of session follows -----
553 : ;... list:; syntax illegal for recipient addresses




If I leave the To: field blank, the message is delivered correctly, there is
no bounce, and the Bcc: field still is not part of the delivered headers.

Go to `Setup-Configure' and use A(dd) in the address-book line. You are

    Yes.  Go into your configuration and ensure that aggregate commands
are enabled.  Then simply open the newsgroup and enter the key sequence

        ; A A D

This will delete every posting in the newsgroup as of that time and
bring your .newsrc file current.

I believe I am as confused as Ed is.  If a message WAS forwarded to you in the
index of a folder any message that was forwarded will have the subject with
(fwd) at the end of it.  When you did a whereis were you in the folder index
or in an actual message?  If you were in the index and it said found on line 4
it is telling you that the data you typed in was found on line four of the
screen.  So go to line 4 that should be the message that you are looking for.
Another thing that you can try is to do a whereis on the person who sent 
you the message this way you can look at all the messages from that person
and find the forwarded message that way. Are you sure that you are
looking in the right folder?  That's the best that I can do to help.

Pine has an "email" feature.
Send an "email" to postmaster@nerc.com !
Ask him about those new newsgroups.
And for a copy of the netiquette.

Subject: INBOX.lock problem: can't read my mail!

Hi!

I am using PINE 3.91 on a UNIX machine, and for two days I haven't been 
able to get any mail.  I am not sure if the problem is directly related to 
PINE, but any help would be greatly appreciated! (I have asked the admin
here, but he couldn't fix the problem...)

Here are the symptoms:
* I can't receive mail (!!!)
* I can open PINE, and view the same INBOX as two days ago.  Never any new 
  message (and some have been sent).  I can browse through all my folders.
* I can send mail
* When I try to quit PINE, it freezes!  Then a $USER.lock file is created
  in the directory where my INBOX is, i.e. /usr/mail/bizz.lock.  
  I can delete it but PINE stays frozen and I have to kill the process.
* I looked at the .pine-debug files, and I have found this suspicious line:

IMAP 11:16 8/22 mm_log babble: Find of mailbox outside context: 
/u/tlt/bizz/.pine-interrupted-mail


Any ideas?  Any comments/ideas/suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you very much!

I am the System Administrator for our PMDF installation. I have just
downloaded PC-Pine from your site.

I can send mail (as you can see!), read newmail sent to me, but I cannot
see the folders that are set up in VMS mail already. And, if I add a
folder in PC-Pine, it doesn't show up in VMS mail.

We are also running PMDF Pine, and would like our PC users to start using
PC-Pine.

Help, please!

Thanks to the folks who responded...but...the problems persists,

after the pine command is issued the user is faced with over a minute
delay before
the Pine screen is displayed. The process is in brackets as shown:

$ ps -ef|grep pine

    root 20652 12420   0 16:23:06 pts/12  0:00 [pine]                   
$ ps gu|grep pine

As you can see the cpu and memory seems fine.

One of the responses was:

Pine may be having difficulty starting, I have heard that pine can use
a lot of memory if the Inbox folder is very large. Check your
paging space with 'lsps -a', a program will be slow to start if
it has to get hold of a lot of memory that isn't very available.


But a lsps -a command reveals this:

$ lsps -a

Thank god for portables...but
my battery is dying.

Many Thanks........

    Unfortunately, you have not provided nearly enough information for
people on this group to be able to help you.  There are many different
factors that could be involved, depending on your hardware and software
setup, all different.  If you are in an installation (such as a
university or corporate environment) which has a help desk or
information center, you should give them a call first, as they are much
more likely to be familiar with your configuration than we are.  We
simply do not have adequate information to work from.

Go to the setup screen and set enable-aggregate-command-set. Hit ";" to
bring up the aggregate commands. Then hit "A" to select all articles. Then
hit "A" to apply a command to the selected articles. Select "D" to delete
the articles which is the same as marking them as read since you can't
really delete a article from a usenet group.

Message-Id: <slrn523eue.216.jason@pris.oit.co.uk>


Hi there

Over dialup PPP, IMAP gives better responsiveness than running pine on the
remote host - except that it looks to me that pine only asks for information
about enough messages to fill the current page. Now this is understandable,
but are there plans to make it a bit more intelligent - say download more
msg headers in the background, or at least cache them so that it doesn't go
off and ask for the same ones again? (You see it easiest when moving up/down
a folder listing - when you move beyond the last msg, pine freezes and it
looks like IMAP goes and asks for the entire screens-worth of msgs again -
not even just the single new one).

Does anyone know how to use pine upload command? I read the help file for
it and it allows you transfer a file from your computer into a message you
are composing. What value do I use for this command in the setup area?
Thanks

	It depends on what file transfer protocol is in use by the
communications SW you are using.

	Have you used your comm SW to upload/download files to the
U*IX host (w/o pine)?  If so, the command that you issued on the
U*IX host to "prep" it for the xfer is what you'd put in the setup
for the "upload" command.

    Unfortunately, there is no single answer to your question, because
it all depends on what software you are using to connect your (MS-DOS,
I presume) PC to your Un*x shell account -- and what software is
installed on your Un*x system.  Check to see if 'sz' is available on
your Un*x system and if your PC communications software supports
'zmodem' protocol.  If so you can use zmodem file tranfer, which is 
one of the better ones, but again, the exact details will vary from
software package to software package.  You may need to read the Un*x
man page for sz and your comm software manual.

    You can add the Reply-To: header yourself.  From the Pine main
menu, just go into Setup and Config.  Scroll down to customized-hdrs:
and add the header you want.  That should do it.

Hello!

	I am a computer consultant at the University of Michigan and I am
attempting to help a user who is running Pine on a VAX system.  When
they try to send mail by pressing control-x, it asks them "Send Message?"
and the respond by pressing 'y'.  However, the next thing that happens is
that a message comes up saying, "Mail not sent  ACP file creation failed."
Then they are kicked back to the message they were trying to send.  ANy
ideas?   What is an acp file?  Thanks.

     I have a multi-attachment message stuck in my Pine inbox on my
BBS and have been unable to export it to my hard drive.  The export
command says a copy of the message was created in some file (call it
"temp")--but I can't find this file.  Obviously, I don't know what the
heck I'm doing--but the instructions (?) for carrying out the export
are terse at best.  

     This must be a simple task, which is why I am all the more
frustrated.  Any tips?  Thanks!

It's taking about two minutes after the pine is selected by a user until
it appears on
their screen.

A ps of the process show the command in brackets like so:


$ ps -ef|grep pine                                      
    bman 16877 29162   0 22:57:30  pts/3  0:00 [pine]   
    bman 27120 29422   0 22:57:41  pts/0  0:00 grep pine

I've never seen the brackets before.....

help.

This is my experience too.  In addition, as I've posted in other threads
using the :; trick hasn't worked for me with sendmail 8.7.5 and pine 3.91 --
the message is delivered to the recipients in the Bcc: field and they can't
see anything they shouldn't, but the message also bounces with the following
error from sendmail:

553 : ;... list:; syntax illegal for recipient addresses

I've found one case where there is a bcc: (not Bcc:) header added to a message,
but it's blank.

With pine 3.91, I activated rich headers, left the To: blank, and filled in
the Bcc: field with my own address on the local machine multiple times.  
I received one copy of the message (as expected, sendmail didn't send 
multiple copies), and it contained a

bcc:

field, with no one listed.  That was somewhat unexpected.

Agreed.  As I posted in another thread, with pine 3.91 and sendmail 8.7.5,
using a

	:;

in the To: field and putting the real recipients in the Bcc: field works
mostly, but although the message is correctly delivered to the Bcc: recipients
a bounce is generated by sendmail.

Mine too.

The program exists, but it will never be a sub-program of Pine.  Pine
is a "mail user agent", meaning it's a program you fire off to read
and write your mail (and news).  It does not redistribute mail.  Even
when you send mail with Pine, it just hands off the completed mail
message to another program for processing and delivery.

What you want could pretty easily be achieved using "procmail", a
commonly installed (on Unix systems, anyway) mail processing program.
You can get some information on it (and on mail processing in general)
at: <URL:http://www.jazzie.com/ii/faqs/archive/mail/filtering-faq/>.

Hi,

1. can anybody tell us how to filter incoming mails? Is there a specific 
file or do we need a special external program? When true, which one can 
we use?

2. how can you forward mail, so that all mail one person is getting are 
automaticly forwarded to another user-address on the net? I've got two 
hosts and I want to get all messages on both hosts.

Thank you. Bye Marcus & Malte.

  Ok TjL, when I get to this screen I type: "A" to subscribe.
PINE asks me:
"Enter full group name or substring of group to get list: "

Ok, then I enter a period "." and hit return. I figured that every Usenet
group has a period in it so basically a list shows up of all the groups my
PINE provider carries. I hope this helps ya. Take care, J.

Well Norman, pine doesn't actually send e-mail.  It just lets you read
it and write it.  It's a "user agent."  So there is nothing wrong with
pine.  You will notice there's a configuration line called
smtp-server= 
at least in the unix version; I'm not sure how dos/windows handles this.
The smtp-server is the transport agent that actually sends the mail and
receives it.  To talk to the smtp server you need to be connected to the
Internet in some way; or if your own machine is the smtp server (in which
you put localhost after the = above) your machine has to have a route to
other machines on the Internet.

So pine could be compared to writing the letter and putting a stamp on it;
or getting it out of the mailbox and reading it.  What happens between
the rest of the world and the mailbox is not a concern of pine's, except
to the extent that it will accept an instruction to put the mail in a 
particular outgoing box (e.g., the mail transport agent at your ISP).

Tony,

One of our user services people at UW is preparing a long document
describing how to do Japanese mail reading with Pine.  It's still in
preliminary state and has known errors, so I don't know if she wants to
let it out yet.  But I've bcc'd her on this message; if she wants to send
you a copy on a "use at your own risk" basis that'd be her decision...

ISO-2022-JP is simply mixed ASCII (English) and JIS (Japanese) text in 7
bits, using ESC codes to shift back and forth between them.  Your terminal
emulator may support this encoding as "JIS7". 

Pine does not do too well with ESC codes.  Each ESC code occupies three
bytes, which Pine thinks occupies screen space even when it doesn't.  For
this reason, I usually convert the data to 8-bit code (either EUC or SJIS)
using the display-filter functionality along with the "nkf" program (if
you do serious work with Japanese on Unix, you probably have a copy of
nkf).

You may need to do some experimentation to get it working, and you should
also be sure that you're using the latest version of Pine.  Earlier
versions of Pine have known problems working with Japanese text.

For more information about Japanese encodings and the nkf program, I refer
to you to Ken Lunde's book "Understand Japanese Information Processing".

If you have pine folders, they should show up in your home directory
or the mail subdirectory.  They should have mail in them whether or
not pine is able to read them.

Check the permissions on your .pinerc file.  It may be that you
entered pine as root and it changed the ownership or permissions
on the file.  You might also want to check the permission etc. on
the folders, to make sure pine can read them.  I would advise doing
nothing dramatic here, everything should be okay with some minor
fixes.

Help!  I have Pine 3.94 and WAS able to view my status line, that is up
until 2 days ago.  Now there's nothing in the left-hand column...just the
number of the messages.

I want to be able to see it when I delete a message (i.e., "D") and when
someone sends an email directly to me (i.e., "+").

Is this a problem with Pine or my ISP?

Thanks,

Adele

It worked when I just re-tested it.  Don't ask why it didn't this

have been part of the problem.

I noticed this time that Pine explicitly asked me if I wanted

You can consider this posting to be taken care of.  Thanks to those

When you ftp'd the file across did you do it in binary mode (as against
ASCII mode)?  Some systems' ftp clients auto-detect come ftp servers'
operating systems and default to binary mode if appropriate.

The trouble is that people often come to assume this will always work, and
it doesn't (it depends on a number of factors).

To play it safe give the "binary" ftp command before starting the transfer
with the "get" command.

Hi,

I was previously using Pine at university, but now I am working and I have
got Pine by FTPand built it.  Everything seems to work fine, but I am not
getting a '+' symbol in the status column of the index screen to denote
personal email.

As I am on a few mailing lists this makes sorting my mail each morning
quite difficult.  I thought it might be because I hadn't got my address in
the alternative addresses list, but I have entered all possible
working permutations and combinations of my address and still no luck.

Can anyone help?

	When you get an email with your address in the To: field 
cut the entire To: field (minus the To:, right) and paste that into
the alternative addresses list.

	Then quite and restart pine....or maybe even go to a different
folder and back again.  The "+" should now be visible.

Thanks, it works now.  All that had happened was that I hadn't quit and
restarted.  I just never thought of that. =o)

That bit of advice would be a good thing to put on the config/setup help
screen, unless it is already and I just missed that too.

Subject: IMAP Domain appended when replying to a local address
Date: 26 Aug 1996 15:47:08 GMT
Message-Id: <4vsgts$1j1s@ds2.acs.ucalgary.ca>

When composing a new message to a local user, pine adds the user-domain
from the pinerc.  However when replying to a message where address is
"local" pine adds the imap server host address rather than the
user-domain.  I could not find any option to change this behaviour.  

I see from the pine-info archives that there has been some discussion 
about this over a year ago. We are running IMAP2bis  and I wondered if 
the new protocols would overcome this problem.

Any suggestions?  We are using canned AIX binaries for sendmail and cannot
change defaults.

Try one of the packages 'procmail' or 'filter' (filter is part of elm).

Subject: Bug (ID JX1YQ): When Deleting Message


Gentlemen:

First let me say that I have been using PINE (Version 3.91 - I believe, 
the current version) for nearly a year, and am very pleased with its 
performance. I am with a company of about 50 people, many of who use PINE 
on a regular basis. To date, nobody reported anything unusual with the program.

Within the last week, I have noted the following problem, which 
could possibly be a bug.

When attempting to delete a message from my INBOX, the program seemingly 
goes through the correct steps of deletion, and allows me to exit.

When I reenter the program and bring up my INBOX folder, the deleted 
message is recreated as a partial copy of the original message, and is 
entitled "No Message Text Available." Additionally, both the message 
date and title are removed. This seems to occur both when selecting "D" 
for delete, as well as "X" for expunge. 

Thus, I CAN NOT DELETE messages, and the count either remains the same or 
gets progressively larger.

Furthermore, today I have received a PINE message that "INBOX has been 
closed," leaving only the last 3 messages.

I would be grateful to hear from anyone who has experienced this or a 
similar problem, and advise what my options are.

Thank you for your effort.

Can I configure pine to automatically include a '--' =B4line before the
signature (if there is one) short of explicitly including the '--' line
into my signature file?`

=09It is not a config option.....so you'll need to add it in your
signature.  I suspect you ask this since, if I recall, some other
programs add the "--" to the signature and if you add it in manually
you end up with tow sets of "--".

=09Regards,

If you use "sendmail-path", you must also include all the command-line
options that you expect Pine to use when it calls Sendmail.  E.g.:

	sendmail-path=/opt/local/sbin/sendmail -bs -odb -oem

I got bit by this same thing a while back.

I'm our PMDF system administrator, and I'm sorry to say I don't know of a
news server I can connect to to test Pine's capabilities in this area.

Anybody know of one I can subscribe to, and how?

Thanks in advance!

Hi ... I used PINE about three years ago and am thrilled that my sysop 
finally made this new version available to me (I had used mm and hated 
it). Anyway, the last time I used PINE, messages I sent used to be 
automatically filed in a Sent Messages folder. Somehow this does not 
happen in this new version.   I either want that, or at least would like 
to be a cc on each of my outgoing messages, so that I get a copy for my 
files. My sysop is not "pine-literate" so she can't help me. How 
can I set up a "Sent Messages" folder, or arrange to be an automatic cc 
on all my messages?

can you help?

Many thanks.

Subject: .pinerc problem with IRIX 6.2 and autofs
Date: Tue, 27 Aug 1996 12:03:29 -0700
Message-Id: <Pine.SGI.3.95.960827114459.24789A-100000@mothra.zgi.com>

Hello,

I am running pine version 3.95 on an SGI Indigo2.  I just upgraded to IRIX
6.2 and started having problems.  We are using autofs (IRIX multithreaded
automounter) to share home directories between machines.  The home
directory is initially mounted as /a/mothra/home and then autofs creates a
/home tree and mounts the directory /home/mothra in place.  There is no
link created as with other automounter programs.  Other machines home
directories are mounted as /home/flames or whatever.

The problem is when you start up pine if your user account is on the local
machine, you get the error message:

Error writing /home/mothra/martig/.pinerc : Improper link

Trying to access the addressbook gives you the eror:

Error opening address book .addressbook: Improper link

If I set the home directory to point to /a/mothra/home/martig instead of
/home/mothra/martig, everything works fine.  If a user with a home
directory mounted from another machine (using autofs) starts up pine it
works fine. I am assuming that it has something to do with this second
mount of the home partition, but I don't know what to do about it.  I
can't just mount the home partition on /home/mothra because /home is
controlled by autofs. 

Any help you can give would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Dear Pine Experts

I would appreciate any help that anyone could give me with this problem. I
run a mailing list via my University using listserv software on their
machine. I get tons of error messages that take hours to download from my
ISP's machine. I then go about trashing them all anyway. I have checked
with the listmaster and it is not possible to delete them at the source. I
then contacted my ISP and they say that it may be possible to filter out
these error messages for deletion prior too them being put in my "mailbox"
but they don't know how to do it. They us Pine to run their e-mail
delivery. I would appreciate any help or pointers to other resources that
anyone can offer. Thanks

Yours Sincerely

Tom Gilas

Unix Pine will do pop .... the syntax is something like:

incoming-folders={pop3host.domain/pop3}MailBox_Name

I've poured over the man pages for pine without luck.

(How) can one alter the duration of the informational displays such as
"Last message deleted"?  It obviously is coded into the program since
it lasts far longer than the time necessary to actually delete the
message(s).

It is kind of annoying to have to wait so long.

Really? As far as I can see you can't change this line from the setup
(at least not in version 394) - and not in the .pinerc -file either...

Pine Development Team: Would it be possible to include a command like

2 New messages, 5 Old messages, Last time Pine used, etc..

Don't want it in reverse or bold. Just plain text. Would be usefull to
capture it and use it in a menu.

THanks!

How do I go about combining mailbox files from Pine in Unix and Eudora on
a PC?  Can I just concatenate them, or do I need to put some formatting
codes at the concatenation point?  

Also, should I use binary or ascii mode when FTPing the files?

Thanks!

Of course, you could take a copy of your normal "--"-less signature into a
separate file and add the "--".  Pine can then be configured (in the Setup
Configuration screen) to use this alternative file.  (It only *defaults*
to a file called ".signature" in your home directory (for UNIX Pine).)

You need to set up a "default FCC" folder name.  This will then be used to
fill in a value for the "Fcc:" header for every message you send (ie,
it'll be the default value for this header).

The "Fcc:" header names the folder to be used for a "File Carbon Copy" of
the outgoing message ... sort of like photocopying a letter you've written
and putting the copy in your filing cabinet.

To set up the default go to Pine's Setup Configuration screen ("S" then
"C" from the Main Menu), then look for a variable called "default-fcc",
then set a value for it.  For UNIX Pine the suggested folder name is
"sent-mail":

	default-fcc              = sent-mail

When you use Pine for the first time in each new month it will offer to
change your sent-mail folder, renaming the current one to end with last
month's name (and then offer to delete any older such folder in order to
save disk space).

Some hints that may be useful:

*  If you set up a default-fcc value then every message you send out will
default to being recorded in your nominated folder.  You can over-ride
this for a particular message you are composing by putting the cursor on a
header line and typing ^R to see the Rich Headers, then delete the folder
name from the "Fcc:" header field.

*  Alternatively you may decide to NOT save every outgoing message
automatically (by setting the default-fcc variable to "")m and use the
above trick in reverse to specify an Fcc folder for those occasional
message you do want to save a copy of.

* You can give a replacement Fcc value mail to for a particular
correspondent, overriding the default-fcc value, by adding that person to
your Address Book along with an Fcc value for them.  Any message sent with
that person listed as the first recipient will get stored in the specific
Fcc folder instead (at least, I think that's how it works:-)

	Sure.....but then you have to maintain (and remember) that you
have 2 signature files.  Yes, they may not change that often...but why
have 2 when 1 will do.

Hi,

is there any way to state a different sort order for news articles than
for mail messages?

E.g., I'd like to keep mail sorted by date of arrival, but news should be
sorted by subject to keep threads together. Always having to hit "$S" is a
bit annoying.


Thanks!

Correct.  Thanks you for mentioning this!
Folks - the extra space is intentional.  Please use it!  Thank you!

The "sigdashes" line makes it possible for programs to detect the signatu=

Subject: PC-Pine Global Addressbook on Netware Server problem
Date: 27 Aug 1996 19:48:14 GMT
Message-Id: <4vvjdu$q2m@netnews.upenn.edu>


I maintain a global addressbook on a unix system and then download
it to a drive on a Netware 4.1 server so that PC-Pine users can access
it as well.

The problem is that when someone starts PC-Pine the addressbook is
opened (in read-only mode) which locks the file against writing.  This
means I can only update the global addressbook if no-one is running
PC-Pine at the time.

Does anyone know a fix for this problem?

I'm afraid not... there is only one default sort order, and that affects
both ordinary and news collections of folders.

There is occasional talk from hte Pine Team about the possibility of
introducing per-folder or per-collection sorting.

Personally I feel the former overkill (to use and to manage), and would (I
think:-) be happy with two separate default sort methods: one affecting
folders within a news collection, the other affecting all other folders.
Presumably this would be easier to implement too?

I don't think you should change the "From" (note: no ':') line, but
isn't it possible to put a "From: address" in the customized header?
I do this with elm.

Mark:
: 
:      I have a multi-attachment message stuck in my Pine inbox on my
: BBS and have been unable to export it to my hard drive.  The export
: command says a copy of the message was created in some file (call it
: "temp")--but I can't find this file.  Obviously, I don't know what the
: heck I'm doing--but the instructions (?) for carrying out the export
: are terse at best.  
: 

With pine's export command you export messages from your mail folder to
separate files in your home directory in the unix machine.  You can't
export to your hard disk directly from pine.  To do this, check the
terminal program you use, or consult local FAQs by your system admin
about carrying out file transfers.

I don't think there is a way (at least I haven't found one), but I just
want to mention that it should actually be '-- ' (an extra space at the
end of the line.)

    On the contrary, depending on your setup, you may be able to send a
file directly from Pine to your PC hard disk.  I do it all the time.  I
run Pine under a flavor of Un*x, dialed in from a DOS PC.  zmodem is
available both on the Un*x host and on my PC communications software
(ProComm Plus v2/DOS).

    I have a shell script on the Un*x host called sendz.  Whenever I am
viewing a message or text-type attachment, I invoke the pipe facility
of Pine (|), which must be enabled in the config, and just answer the
prompt with 'sendz'.  On my setup, the message or attachment is auto-
matically downloaded to a ramdisk on my PC, where I can do with it
whatever I want.

    Note that the downloaded wile will have the DOS filename of
'DOWNLOAD.nnn' where nnn is the first three digits of the Un*x process
number (I think).  If you are downloading multiple messages or files in
short order, you may need to shell out and rename the file after each
download.  Also, you may want to change the temporary directory used
for the intermediate file.

#!/bin/sh
umask 066
trap "rm -f $HOME/tmp/$$download" 0
cat > $HOME/tmp/download.$$$
sz -a $HOME/tmp/download.$$$
rm -f $HOME/tmp/download.$$$

I am working with a new startup ISP in installing IMAP and PC-Pine. The IMAP
daemon seems to be working fine now, except whenever a user uses PC-Pine to
access files off the IMAP server when the user opens a message in his in-box
he gets an error message saying "Error Creating
/var/spool/mail/xxxxxxxx.lock.yyyyyy.zzzzz", where xxxxxxxx is the users
login ID and yyyyy and zzzzz are a series of numbers. Now the message is
retrieved and displayed properly, but the annoying error message still
appears. This only happens with the in-box, access to folders doesn't cause
the message to display. Any suggestions on how to get rid of the message?

Good Morning.

We are upgrading to 3.95 from 3.91 and noticed the BCC behavior has
changed.

In 3.91 the BCC header field and recipients appear to all addressees.
In 3.95, the BCC recipients are 'invisible' as they should be, but so is
the BCC header field!  The BCC recipient has no idea how he received the
message.  

Is there a patch to make the BCC header field appear (minus the
recipient list of course)?

Hi Pine folks,

Ever since upgrading from Pine 3.91 on SunOS 4.1.3_U1 some time ago, I've been
experiencing periodic (a couple of times a week) hangs while sending a message
with each subsequent version release. This continues in v3.95. I have not been
able to isolate any obvious patterns; it happens on messages destined for
addressbook folks and for directly addressed mail; I thought it might be
caused by a nameservice problem, but my machine readily resolves the MX
records for the addresses in a hung send. The only remedy is to kill -TERM
from another session (and I have Ctrl-z enabled).

I've attached the .pine-debug output on the most recent instance, tho I don't
see anything obvious there either.  It looks to be hanging just before the
call to the SMTP server, which is the same machine running stock Sun Sendmail
4.1/SMI-4.1. Any thoughts/suggestions?

Cheers  - Gregg

What can I do to correct this.  I am not on the internet, so I don't 
really have a domain because I am not connecting anywhere?  newserver is 
the name of the Unix box, BTW, I didn't name it.

Hello,

i don't know if this is a bug or something else, I just want to mention this.
When you reply (answer) to a message there is normaly an "A" in front of the 
Subjectline like this: 

"  A   2 Aug 25 Dirk Soren    (3,172) Re: gh" 

But when you postpone a reply, continue this message and then send it, 
this "A" does not appear in the that first field like normaly. 
Is this a configproblem or just missing. I'm using pine3.95 for linux.

Frank

This has been done before:  ELM's "readmsg" utility.
It's not perfect, actually it is a little buggy.
I wish someone would write this thing in Perl...

Yes, this is the remapped Return being read as a ^J problem all over
again. Yes, I'm using NCSA Telnet 2.6 for the Mac. I've already searched
the archives thoroughly; this problem is mentioned several times, but no
one ever seems to get a solid answer. Here's my story:

I've been using Pine for three years on a Solaris 2.5 machine, using NCSA
Telnet with no problems whatsoever. I recently switched to a new ISP
running FreeBSD and BSD/OS (depending on which machine you're on). Right
away I had the classic ^C (cancel command) and ^J (auto-justification)
problems. I checked the limited preferences in NCSA Telnet and verified
the problem was not there. Yes, I made sure the Interrupt key was not
mapped to ^C...
  
Someone suggested to me that NCSA Telnet was in fact sending ^J^M
(linefeed/carriage return) as its Return, and the telnetd on the BSD
machines was not weeding out the ^J before sending the Returns on to
Pine. And of course, Pine reads the ^J as a call for auto-justification
(or file attachment, if you're in the header). Another user recommended
using the Enter key on the number pad as a workaround, but it still trips
the ^J about 30% of the time.

I called NCSA's support line, and they said that even if that was true,
the Telnet project has been discontinued and they can't do anything about
it.

Yesterday, the sysadmins at this new ISP started compiling Pine 3.95 on
all of their machines. On the machines running FreeBSD, both the ^C and ^J
were fixed immediately. However, on the main server running BSD/OS, only
the ^C problem was fixed. The Return key is still screwed up. I asked the
sysadmin if it was possible that Pine's system configurations were set
differently on the BSD/OS machine that they were on the FreeBSD machines,
but he assured me that they were not.

Using the *same* copy of Telnet with the *same* settings all around, Pine
3.95 works fine on Solaris 2.5 machines and FreeBSD machines, but not on a
BSD/OS machine. Would this imply that the telnetd on that BSD/OS machine
is what is remapping my Returns? If so, what could I or my sysadmin do
about it? Is this something that could be taken care of by
strategically-placed tset, stty, or termios commands?

Thanks.

You might try using $O instead of $s... it's the closest you can get to

I'm currently using pine for my email and would like to know if the 
explunge command deletes the mail permanately or if there is some other 
command you have to use to keep it out of the directory.  Someone told me 
that when she gets into her main mail directory she has to compress 
because her pine mail is still there.

	Its something else.  It is a future enhancement.  Currently
pine cannot track the status of a reply.  You can always use the *(flag)
command to change the status manually.

I fixed this problem on our system by mailing a default message to

My guess is you are looking for a better way than that, but I hope

This message indicates a very serious configuration problem on the server.

The imapd daemon is not able to create the lock file, used to prevent mail
delivery (from sendmail, etc.) when imapd is reading and especially when
imapd is rewriting the mail file.  If a locking failure occurs at the
right time, mail will be lost and/or the mail file will be damaged.

The most likely cause is that the server has the protection of the
/var/spool/mail directory set so that world-write is not permitted.  The
correct protection on this directory is 1777; that is, world write with
the sticky bit. 

Certain sorcerer's apprentices believe that /var/spool/mail should be
protected to deny world write on "security grounds", based on an incorrect
notion that making every email program run with privileges is more secure
than closing the relatively modest loopholes caused by links and improper
ownerships in this directory.

The ISP needs to make sure that /var/spool/mail is protected 1777, and
that his mail delivery program (typically /bin/mail) has all the current
safeguards against links and incorrect mailbox file ownerships.

This morning users reported our system was running very slowly.

Investigation revealed a rogue Pine process which was still running,
and gobbling up system resources, although the user concerned was not
logged in. Thus ps showed the process attached to process 1.

The user is on a PC running the ICETEN terminal emulator via RS232 RIO
Remote Terminal Adapters onto a Pentium 75 server running SCO Unix 3.4.2.

I suspect the user just turned her machine off rather than logging out.

Usually this leaves the current session running - whatever it is. In this
case she must have been somewhere in Pine.

Does this problem ring a bell with anyone?

I think that Tony has a choice to use PINE 3.95LJ1.1b2 if he
would like to handle Japanese character messages with pine on
his machine.

PINE 3.95LJ1.1b2 is a Japanese patched version of pine 3.95.
FTP it from `ftp.noc.titech.ac.jp' in `/pub/tmp/aki/pine/'.

If you use it, you also have to prepare `CANNA' which is a
network-extensible Kana-to-Kanji conversion system for
inputting Japanese character code, and `kterm' with X
Window (which include k14 font) for displaying Japanese
character.


The other choice (dose not use pine):

Prepare `Mule' and MUA(Mail User Agent) which supports
ISO-2022-JP and is used with Mule (such as `mnews',`mh
(mh-6.8.3-JP.2c)', `Mew'...). It goes without saying
that use `kterm' with X Windows System and `CANNA'(or
`Wnn').

  `Mule' is a MULtilingual Enhancement to GNU Emacs.
  It can handle not only ASCII characters (7 bits) and
  ISO Latin-1 (8 bits), but also Japanese, Chinese,
  Korean (16 bits) coded in the ISO-2022 standard and
  its variants (e.g. EUC, Compound Text).
  FTP it from `sh.wide.ad.jp' in `/JAPAN/mule', or
  `etlport.etl.go.jp' in `/pub/mule'.

I hope this information proves useful.

In my setup (the usual one, I assume) the display lasts until I do
something, but it isn't a delay per se.. there is an option called
status-message-delay, you might try to set it to 0 (the default) if it
isn't already?

Are you assuming that you can't do anything until the message goes away?

That is not the case.  The only time user input is blocked by an
informational message is when it's important enough to want to guarantee
you a chance to read it *AND* the user input would result in overwriting
that msg too soon.   Pine denotes this situation by putting angle
brackets at the beginning and end of the message text, in addition to the
normal square brackets.

mail is probably using $MAIL as its inbox.
$MAIL is not changed when you su.

pine use your username which does change to root to find

I tried to send to multiple newsgroup. with a comma. It says sending. But
later I get a message from some other place in charge of newsgroup and
says couldn't post. It delete all the message I wrote from the newsgroup I
posted. Why is that?

What is the maximum you can send multiple newsgroup with out having to
bounce back to you and get rejected?

Pine asked for my user name and password.  I see the RD and SD

Hi All,

	Don't know which newsgroup is proper for posting this question so
please reply, thanks.

	What happened to gopher://services.more.net? It is no longer
reachable via lynx. Thanks in advance.

	Also and on topic, Is there a free newgroup server, where one can
point a freenet copy of a User's Pine copy to. Virgin Islands Paradise
Freenet doesn't carry the Usenet newsgroups, but has Pine and that
configuration line is configurable by the individual user. So I would like
to make use of it. Thanks!

	NCF doesn't have PINE, yet.

The answer is:

Only the last item (#7) applies when computing the Message-Id. 
Perhaps we should clarify the Tech Notes on this point... 
----------------------------

Q: Can anyone write me how I can set up my system in order to put the
domain name "uio.no" after the name of the sending host?

domain name = uio.no
nis domain = uio

TIA

Hello,

I have recently upgraded my linux system to Slackware 3.1. I have also
compiled the 3.95 pine....

I am working with imap, leaving my mailbox exclusively on one host and
reading it from another.
I setted this through the customization menu setting the
user-domain,smtp-server,inbox-path variables.

I had this configuration also before and it worked without problems and
fast.

Now as I had the a.out system using pine 3.91 checking the mailboxes was
fast and without errors.

Actually with the elf system and pine 3.95 checking the mailboxes is very
slow and I get after some hours of active pine lots of "inbox closed due to
errors" messages. Further often pine dosn't show me the latest messages
arrived in the (distant) inbox

so what's going wrong?

I am not on the mailing list (BTW could some one tell me how to register?)
so please make at least a CC to me per mail.

ciao
bboett@erm1.u-strasbg.fr

Goto Main-Menu, choose addressbook. Build a list with your friends with a
suitable listname. If the friends already in addressbook, you may use the
list-mode to choose any subset of your friends.
After this in Compose you have to input the listname only.

Mime-Version: 1.0

I just installed procmail and configured it to split my incoming mail 
into folders in a new directory ($HOME/inbox).

The default folder is called "default" :-)

In .pinerc I made the following changes:

:
inbox-path=~/inbox/default
:
incoming-folders=~/inbox/test,
	~/inbox/pine,
	~/inbox/<other interresting names>
:

My question:

The TAB-key initiates a check for new mail in the incoming folders ONLY
when INBOX (~/inbox/default) is opened. When one of the additional folders
is open, pressing the TAB-key results in 'No more new messages'. When I go
back to the INBOX, the TAB-key results in the proposal to open the folder
with the new messages.

Is it possible to do use the check while in an open additional incoming
folder, and how ?

Subject: setting a fixed vaule to reply-to or from fields

hello,

i need to perform the following, please help.

problem:
i'd like to set a vaule to the From: field.  

scenerio:
I have multiple hosts with multiple people using the same login account.
ie HOST A  person a, person b, person c

each of these people use the same login.  Each host is unique, ie remote
location.

so the shared login is different from the host but the pine account is
the host name (remote location name).

the problem:

i need variables Reply-to: or From: to contain the host@domain instead
of login_account@domain.

we are using pine 3.95 and it was compiled to allow change to the From
field.

iam unable to set a value to the From field or to the Reply-to field.

i am using the /opt/local/lib/pine.conf.fixed file.  

could some one please post an example of how to assign a value to one of
these variables.

i can get the reply-to field to appear but can't assign the value.

i've been looking all over for the info and just can't seem to find the
correct areas.

johnw

Pine 3.91 has an error in its POP 3 code. Use version 3.95 (seems to me i=
t
works well or at least much better when accessing POP 3 mailboxes).

When I try to mail from Pine, I get the following:

  Bug in Pine detected: "Received abort signal". Exiting pine.

We, Francis Marion University, have a Alpha 2100 with two 275 Mhz CPU's,
and we are using Multinet from TGV/Cisco.

I have compiled the code with the following commands and tested Pine
after doing so, and received the same error message each time.

@vmsbuild multinet

and

@vmsbuild __Alpha__ multinet

I have download several versions of Pine and I get same the same error
message.  The versions I have tried are the following:

Ver 3.85, Ver 3.91b5, and the version that comes on the
Freeware CDROM of Ver 7.0 OpenVMS.

In the Pine.conf file I have the following set.

I found one reference to this problem in the pine-list from March 1995,
and he got no help.  Does anyone know how to fix this, what caused it,
anything?

You might also consider contacting the administrator/support person for pine
at your site.  There is a global configuration file that will automatically
set this for all users, probably not a bad idea.

Subject: sendmail question for someone who knows PINE and NeXT Mail.app
Reply-To: luomat@nerc.com
Organization: Princeton Theological Seminary


PINE has an option:

smtp-server              = localhost                                 


where I can change 'localhost' to be the name of my ISP.  Mail goes  
immediately into the mailq of my ISP, never hitting my mailq.

I am wondering how I can config NeXT's Mail.app to do this. (I can  
config Mail.app to tell it to use a different program than  
/usr/lib/sendmail)

Any suggestions appreciated.

TIA
TjL

        OPTION: Customized-Headers
 
You may add your own custom headers to all outgoing messages.  Each header
you specify here must include the header tag (Reply-To:, Approved:, etc.)
and may optionally include a value for that header.  If you want to see
these custom headers each time you compose a message, you must add them to
your default composer headers list (see above), otherwise they become part
of the rich header set which you only see when you press the rich header
(Ctrl-R) command.

Hi Pinesters,

I'm connecting to Pine, which is running on a unix system through some 
ancient incarnation of novell netware running on a decrepit 286.

When I access Pine, it tends to freeze up after a while.

When I access Lynx, no freezing occurs.

We are using Clarkson TCP, and assorted other drivers and patches.

Anyone have an idea what the problem is?  Do you need more info, or is 
this a known bug?

I thank your gestaltian self in advance.

Mark Crane

This bug is fixed in recent versions of Pine.  (3.95 is current.)
A workaround for 3.91 is to add optional labels to the incoming folder
specifications.

     It's probably a faulty program that checks for new mail which is
thinking that pine's writing of folders is the arival of new mail.

Well lookit that, I've answered my own question.

Carl Edman wrote a /bin/sh script called 'sendmail-remote' to do  
something like this.  I've "improved" the code (added some error  
checking, basically) and submitted my version to next-ftp.peak.org:

currently at:
ftp://next-ftp.peak.org/pub/next/submissions/sendmail-remote.2.0.NIHS.bs.gz

ftp://next-ftp.peak.org/pub/next/submissions/sendmail-remote.2.0.README

should move to:
ftp://next-ftp.peak.org/pub/next/binaries/util/sendmail-remote.2.0.NIHS.bs.gz

ftp://next-ftp.peak.org/pub/next/binaries/util/sendmail-remote.2.0.README

It will also be on peanuts as soon as they get to it (probably  
later today if the past pattern holds).

This can be used as the "Mailer" in Mail.app's Preferences->Expert  
preference. See the readme for more info

Subject: Sug (ID AH4IX): Pine 3.94 dumps a core by sending a mail with attachments larger than 1 Mbyte

Hello,

we are using Pine 3.94 on a HP K200 server with OS level 10.10.

By trying to send mails which have attachments that have a size of 1 Mbyte or above
pine will fail to send of the message.
With default debugging the pine process will consume all available cpu time, but 
cannot send the mail. With debugging level 9 it will stop with the message Memory
fault and will dump a core.

I enclosed the .pine-debug1 file of this job. Perhaps someone
understands it.

Does someone has a idea or a solution of this problem?

Dieter

Subject: pine 3.95, DUnix 4.0, root, addressbook
Date: Thu, 29 Aug 1996 16:43:09 -0400
Message-Id: <Pine.OSF.3.95L.960829163312.11758A-100000@snakes.unh.edu>

Seems there is a similar problem with root running pine to that fixed in
a posting in the newgroups before (and then fixed in 3.95). At least with
Digital Unix, I haven't rebuilt the Solaris and Ultrix versions, which would
be the only other 2 systems to which I have access.

Upon entering the addressbook screen, for root only, the null address
that's used to update the .addressbook (or .addressbook.lu if it's missing,
invalid, or needs updating) causes several possible errors.

If this should help anyone,the following one line patch to adrbklib.c works
for all the cases I've tested: 

-----------

      if(p = last_cmpnt(ab->filename)){
-         if((p - ab->filename) == 1) p++;  /* get at least a '/' in for root */
        strncpy(path, ab->filename, p - ab->filename - 1);
          path[p - ab->filename - 1] = '\0';
        p = path;

OK, thanks to all that posted, my problem of Pine taking over a minute to
appear
on a user's screen is not being caused by the command being in brackets
[pine]

I also have checked our paging space and that seems fine.....so.....

Back to the group with the same problem;...

Once the pine executable is started, it takes over a minute for the main
menu to
appear.

Thanks,

Brian (on the ropes) Goodyear

we are interesting to buy a Non-Linear Editing System.
Our company make videos for clients, and users inside the company, about =
installs of our products, and sales's conventions. this videos are 1 our =
long, with text, graphics,animation,photos and camera.
We have a Convention center with Barco systems.

We need a Non-Linear Editing System to do all of this.

We had seen AVID,MATROX, D-VISION, and another how premiere.... but for =
example, ours videos have a 1 hour of duration, and premiere , I think, =
is more better for 2 or 3 minutes.

Other problem is the render, we need don=B4t render, because uone user =

system, with 2D transitions (is possible 3d too ?).

Can you help us, and make an economic pressupost?

As I get more and more annoyed about mass e-mailings piling up in my
inbox, I am requesting that, for some future Pine version, you include an
anti-spam feature. This may work like this:

Upon first receipt of a spam, I add the sender's address to the Idiots'
List maintained in .pinerc. Whenever pine detects a mail from one of the
Idiots in my inbox, it does one or more of the following, as selected by
.pinerc features:

[X] replies to the sender, using a standardized message from a file on my
disk (e.g. 'this is an automated spam reply to notify you that any
messages from your account are deleted automatically and will not receive
any person's attention') - of course w/o adding the standard footer

[X] deletes the message from my inbox, optionally saving it into a spam
folder

To prevent giving too much information to spammers, I'd like to set up
different default footers for different areas - for example, no phone
number when posting to newsgroups.

Any comp.mail.pine subscribers who agree with me, please post your comment
so that the Pine makers become aware of a general need for this feature.

I need to be able to pipe certain incoming emails to a script, which
starts off by writing the email to a file, and then processing that file
in certain ways.

I can't get started on the script because I'm not sure how to pipe an
email from Pine to have it written to a file. What should the first
command of the script be, to accept the piped email from Pine and write it
to a file?

Any help is appreciated.

    Here is a small script I use to download a message (email -or-
news) to my PC from Un*x Pine.  Note that the first "real" command 
is 'cat'.  That writes the message to a file.

#!/bin/sh
umask 066
trap "rm -f $HOME/tmp/$$download" 0
cat > $HOME/tmp/download.$$$
sz -a $HOME/tmp/download.$$$
rm -f $HOME/tmp/download.$$$
umask 077

Why should anyone volunteer..??  What I was asking, is to take the bottom
on the main screen on entry, and turn it into a command line option.

It says "folder "INBOX" has been opened with ## messages". I think it even
tells you # of new messages at the same time..

# pine -s foldername(def:INBOX)
INBOX: 5 messages, 2 new

-s = status of folder
default to INBOX
allow "ALL".

Pine Team? What do you think? It looks like your most of the way there
already.

of the growing implementation of the Internet and intranet in major=20
corporations.  Simply put, the product translates 3270 data streams into=20
HTML pages and then translates the HTML pages back into 3270 data streams=
=20
to send information back to the mainframe.  While access is the backbone=20
of the product, it is the intelligence of the access that sets STAR:View=20
apart.

B.  How STAR:View works
=09
	STAR:View runs on a Microsoft Windows NT server running the=20
Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS).  The server must have access=
=20
to a 3270 data stream over a TN3270 connection and the end users must=20
have access to the STAR:View server.  Generally, connections to the=20
server are all made over a TCP/IP network.

	STAR:View is accessed from any industry standard browser such as=20
Netscape=92s Navigator or Microsoft=92s Internet Explorer.  When a user=20
clicks on a link from the STAR:View home page, the server establishes=20
connection with the selected mainframe application and then renders the=20
initial mainframe screen into an HTML page.  This rendering is done using=
=20
the unique "Learning Agent" architecture of STAR:View.  Every screen that=
=20
STAR:View translates is rendered using the STAR:View Learning Agents and=20
Knowledge Base.  These agents use a set of rules to determine the best=20
way to render the mainframe screen.  Once a template has been chosen by=20
the Learning Agents, STAR:View uses the template to convert the=20
character-based screen into a graphical page and then generates the page=20
into Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) for transmission to the user.  If=20
data entry is required on the screen, STAR:View translates the user=92s=20
data from the HTML format back into the 3270 format for transmission to=20
the mainframe.

C.  Necessary End-User Configuration to participate in the Star:View Beta=
=20
   Program

	1.  Beta Tester has a Microsoft NT Server running version 3.51 or=20
greater.
	2.  Beta Testers=92 NT Server is setup with Microsoft=92s Internet=20
Information Server version 1.0 or greater.
	3.  Beta Testers=92 NT Server has access to a 3270 data stream over=20
a TN3270 connection.
	4.  Beta Testers=92 client computer is a PC running any version of=20
Microsoft Windows or is a Macintosh computer.
	5.  Beta Testers=92 client computer is running one of the following=20
Internet browsers
		a.  Internet Explorer 2.0 or greater
		b.  Netscape 2.0 or greater
		c.  Mosaic 2.0
	6.  Beta Tester=92s client computer is communicating with the NT=20
Server via TCP/IP.
	7.  Beta Tester has access to the Internet and can send/receive=20
email messages via the Internet.

D.  How to become a Star:View Beta Tester=20

	Send an email to "starview_beta@redwood-city.sterling.com"=20
stating the following information:
		a.  Confirmation that you meet all the necessary end-user=20
configurations
		b.  Email address that you wish to be contacted at
		c.  Company that you work for

	You will be informed via email on where to access the Star:View=20
Beta version on the Internet with appropriate download instructions=20
sometime in Q3 1996.

You probally have mail check in your .profile (or equiv).  It checks
periodically for mail and then shows it at a shell prompt.

If the message was "You have mail" then you are probally keeping mail in
the spool directory instead of having it moved upon exit (through setup
options) to another folder.  Thus, you do indeed have mail unless you have
deleted every message in your inbox.

If there is in fact new (unread) mail then the prompt would display "You
have NEW mail".

I am having trouble sending any mail to aol.com; juno.com; prodigy.com;
and almost anything that has a ".net" in it.  It always comes back to me
with the message of being undeliverable.  I hav tried several times and it
they always come back.  Is there something wrong in our set up or do you
have any idea what might be causing it?  I have already talk to our
support person and he has no idea what is causing it.

Thank you,

Can anyone tell me what I need to do to get my arrow keys to work under a 
wyse60 emulation?  I have heard this is a really bad emulator to use for 
pine, but I have little choice on the emulation or the package (limitted 
by $$$$).  I added the option in the makefile that one individual 
remarked on and recompiled, but it didn't help me.  Am I missing 
something else that I need to do?

I've been experimenting with the pine newsreader and have found a 
rather troublesome feature that I hope can be turned off.  When I
try to follow up to a message, Pine spends ages in the 
'Validating Newsgroups' phase.  Can this be turned off?
I read news from an NNTP server over a modem, and this process is
just to time consuming.

Thanks!

Hi!

I plan to start using PINE 3.95 also for news (I have been using it for mail 
for a lot of time).
Since I need to authenticate to my news server, PINE prompts me for username
and pwd. The problem is that it does prompt me EVERY TIME I change newsgroup.
Isn't it possible to be asked only once for the password or to configure PINE
to automatically send name and pwd?

      Thanks, Mic.

I've downloaded, and compiled pine 3.95 and it's working fine.
Is there anyway to have pine download the messages from the pop
mailbox, delete them, and store locally?  I can see the pop mailbox
getting rather huge with content otherwise.

Set the wyse 60 to vt100 emulation and then set your TERM variable to
vt100.

I received a suggestion to try:
incoming-folders={pop3host.domain/pop3}MailBox_Name
and it didn't work.
First there is no incoming-folders option in the configuration that I saw.
Second, What do you do for a password, required for the pop mailbox?
Should pine prompt for a password?  I am assuming that pine 3.91 on
Linux really can do POP.

Subject: HPUX 10.x VT100 problems with vi, pine, etc
Date: 30 Aug 1996 23:47:25 GMT
Message-Id: <507uid$6vu@news.csus.edu>

Ah, good 'ol HP. At 10.x, they redefined the definition of what a VT100
looks like ('vt100 as defined by DEC vt420'), adding loads of new
definitions. Now, maybe a real VT100 is capable of all these nifty things,
but lots of the 'real world' emulators can't handle it all. Most notably to
us was that vi couldn't delete chars from the middle of a line, and neither
could pico or pine...

Here's the quick and dirty fix:

Go to a v9.x HP system and enter: 'untic vt100 > /tmp/vt100-hp9.raw'
This results in a file that contains the version 9.x definition.

Now take this file to your vesion 10.x system and (assuming the
same path and file name), enter these commands as the superuser:

  mv /usr/share/lib/terminfo/v/vt100 /usr/share/lib/terminfo/v/vt100-hp10
  mv /usr/share/lib/terminfo/v/vt100-am /usr/share/lib/terminfo/v/vt100-am-hp10
  tic /tmp/vt100-hp9.raw
      
If you ever need to return the system to its original configuration:
  mv /usr/share/lib/terminfo/v/vt100-hp10 /usr/share/lib/terminfo/v/vt100
  mv /usr/share/lib/terminfo/v/vt100-am-hp10 /usr/share/lib/terminfo/v/vt100-am
  
  (Note: the hp9 file defines vt100 and vt100-am; under hp10 these two
  definitions are separate)

 I am in the process of rolling out pine as an option to one hundred

The "Lcc" (List carbon copy) header is intended to be used when
you wish to send a message to a list of people but avoid having all
of their addresses visible, in order to reduce clutter when the
message is received.
 
It is similar to the "Bcc" (Blind carbon copy) header in that individual
addressees are hidden, but Lcc is designed to work specifically with
distribution lists you have created in your Pine address book.  Placing
the nickname of the list on the Lcc line will result in the full name of
your Pine Address Book list being placed on the To: line of the message,
using a special notation that distinguishes it from a real address. You
must leave the To: line blank for your list name to appear there.
 

You need to do a Ctrl-R (rich headers) while your cursor is in the
addressing portion of the screen to reveal this option.

These skripts work with pine 3.93, 3.94 and 3.95.
You have to add the following (with correct path!) to your ~/.pinerc:


# This variable takes a list of programs that message text is piped into
# after MIME decoding, prior to display.
display-filters=_BEGINNING("-----BEGIN PGP")_ /home/roland/bin/pgpdecode

# This defines a program that message text is piped into before MIME
# encoding, prior to sending
sending-filters=/home/roland/bin/pgpsign,

Subject: Q: changing the "From"-Field in outgoing messages
Date: 28 Aug 1996 08:43:11 GMT
Message-Id: <5010qv$eel@sun168.rz.ruhr-uni-bochum.de>

My problem is the following: 

I'm using a pc under linux and therefore I'm using the installed sendmail 
for sending e-mail. Incoming mail is collected by a pop-server, and I'm 
using the pop-protocol to transport incoming mail from this pop-server to my 
local pc. I'm using different login-names for the pop-server and for my 
local pc. 

When sending e-mail Pine automatically puts my login-name of my local pc 
into the "From"-field, so that a reply to this address is sent to the user 
of the pop-server which has the same login-name there as I have on my local 
pc. Changing the fields "personal-name" and/or "user-domain" in the 
config-file doesn't seem to solve this problem. The only workaround that I 
found out is to use a customized header "Reply-to:" in my config-file. 

Does anybody know a possibility to change the "From"-field of outgoing mail 
to another address?

Install pine-3.95.  There were bugs in the pop3 code in pine 3.91.

Hi all !

I have encountered the following problem when we updated to this 3.95
version (running under HP-UX): In the "sent-mail" folder, the column
reserved for the recipients' addresses is, instead, filled out with the
sender address (i.e., my name). This is very inconvenient, because
whenever I open this folder to check on the e-mails that I sent, I only
see there my name on the whole column, instead of viewing the recipient
address. This thing didn't use to happen with the old 3.91 version that
we were running before.

Could somebody, please, give me a hint on what to do ?

Thanx-a-lot !

Serban

Ahoy,

  Having recently installed pine 3.95, I am having problems w/ the
use-only-domain-name directive.  I have defined this in
/usr/local/lib/pine.conf.fixed and I have verified its implimentation
by perusing the "Config" part of "Setup" from w/ in the pine program.
use-only-domain-name = Yes is what is displayed.

  The symptoms are as follows:  When composing a new messages, and
inserting in a local user name into the "To:" section, pine correctly
expands that to "GECOS" <login@domain.org> (this appears correct!  Not
server.domain.org).  However, I fire off the message, and invoke pine
to read it, the mail header reads w/:
To: login@server.domain.org
From: login@server.domain.org

  Agg.  Quite frustrating.  I have tried also setting the user-domain
directive w/ the same results.  Help would be muchly appreciated.  This
is a NetBSD system (based on 4.4BSD-lite) and as i said earlier, this
is pine 3.95.  I'm no sendmail guru, perhaps sendmail is influencing
this?

Is anyone aware of a port for the QNX operating system?
