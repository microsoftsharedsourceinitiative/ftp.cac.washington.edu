All your nicknames have to be unique.  Think of the addressbook as a
as a collection of records in a database, with the nickname as the
key field.

Another feature that I like is with distribution lists is, you can
enter in nicknames as the member of that distribution, instead of the
full email address.

That almost makes our database relational.

If you leave the 'normal' inbox the way it is (reading mail from 
/usr/spool/mail/username), but you enable incoming folders (one of 
the many checkboxes in Pine's setup), then you add that part under 
the Incoming-Folders= field.

  Incoming-Folders="POP Account #1" {mailhost.interl.net/pop3}INBOX,
	"POP Account #2" {mail.otherisp.com/pop3}INBOX,
	"POP Account #3" {mail.1234.org}INBOX

This way, using incoming folders, you can still have the INBOX folder 
in Pine, _and_ a folder to read mail directly from the pop3 server.  
If you use the format that you saw in that Linux newsgroup, your 
INBOX folder (now /usr/spool/mail/username) will be replaced by 
{mail.yourisp.com/pop3}INBOX and it will bitch when you start Pine 
that it can't access that folder.

As far as using {<mailserver>/110}INBOX instead of 
{<mailserver>/pop3}INBOX - you might want to go with the 2nd one.  
Not every ISP uses port 110 for pop3.

Please try

where Pine3.94 and Pico2.9 are available for Irix 5.3 machines.

The problem is as follows:

If You run pine on Solaris.x86 it works perfectly until
You set smtp-server=<some.remote.host>. Then it hangs
the system perfectly when You try to send the letter.
It can be revived by reset button only. The same thing with
nntp-server=<some.remote.host>, but it hangs the computer 
when You try to read the news.

I have looked through the archives and have noticed, that
someone has reported the problem with the TCP connection
on Solaris.x86. Was that problem solved?

hi, i'm a relatively new user of pine (3 months), and i have
a simple problem/question.  when i reply to a message, my
.sig appears -above- the quoted message, rather than below.
my sysadmin says he's always seen this behavior, but i think
it's kinda wacky (elm always put the .sig at the end).

anything i can do about this?  i'm a very experienced unix
user, if that helps any.  and yes, i did read pinerc and
the FAQ :).  thanks for any help, Steve

Subject: Weird problem with Pine 3.95 and HP-UX 9.04
Date: 29 Dec 1996 06:41:07 GMT
Message-ID: <slrn5cbj1e.2ll.MANDREWS@mickey.Wittenberg.EDU>

I've got a bizarre problem with Pine 3.95 on an HP-UX 9.04 box (a 9000/856).
In short, when I start it up:

Creating subdirectory "/users/mandrews//users/mandrews/mail"
where Pine will store its mail folders.
Error creating subdirectory "/users/mandrews//users/mandrews/mail"
: No such file or directory

and of course it quits.  This is happening even with the "pine-bin.hpux9"
precompiled binary pulled from the U Washington site...  though I tried
building my own using both gcc 2.7.2 and the lobotomized /bin/cc first.
This machine currently has a copy of Pine 3.91 that came prebuilt from some
FTP site I don't remember (because I wasn't the one that installed it) that
works -- but if I recompile 3.91 myself, it too has problems finding my
home directory.  Hmm...

This has to be something REALLY simple, but it's driving me nuts. :)

Thanks for the very informative reply, Jason. :)

I never did get around to try to access my POP3 with Pine since I ended
up downloading fetchmail and using that instead. Fetchmail picks up the
mail from my POP3 and then you can do whatever you want with it after
that. I'm going to be doing procmail stuff and routing mail to different
inboxes, so fetchmail seems to be the better solution for me.

I haven't configured it in daemon mode yet, so far I've just been
executing it manually as such:

	fetchmail -u <username> -p POP3 <pop3 server>

By default, it puts the mail that it fetches into
/var/spool/mail/<username of person executing fetchmail>

Then I fire-up pine and read my mail. :)

I'd recommend fetchmail for anyone accessing mail over a PPP connection
from a *NIX box. It comes with very clear docs and practically sets itself
up.

Where to get fetchmail:
ftp://ftp.ccil.org/pub/esr/fetchmail

Cheers!

Your sysadmin sounds kind of clueless.

While in pine, go to the main menu, type 's', then 'c', then read all the
wonderful config options.  You will find one of them does what you are
looking for.

    Properly speaking, Pine is not an editor at all, and if you
specified it as an editor to Lynx, I am not surprised you got a mess. 
On the other hand, Pine's internal composer has been split out as a
genuine editor called Pico.  Try specifying Pico to Lynx instead of
Pine.

    If the home page has been set up correctly by the owner, this
should be taken care of automatically.  You shouldn't need to fill in
anything.  All you need the editor for is to compose the message, not
the headers.

Yet our Freenet has somehow rigged it so Pine is invoked whenever a mailer
is needed. How did they do this?

Only if the terminal emulation is also set for iso-8859-1.  Which is
what I already said.

This only demonstrates that your terminal emulation was already set up
for iso-8859-1.  So, you don't have the problem that I was describing.

But it's not such a good idea to recommend that to another, without
explaining to them the issues that are involved.  Could be that their
terminal emulation is set to 7-bit US-ASCII, or maybe to DEC
Multinational, or IBM Codepage 850, whatever.

                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Of course not.  That was precisely my point.  You have to be using
iso-8859-1 (in your terminal emulation) if you want to configure it
into PINE.

James,
I don't have any immediate thoughts on the closing delays,
but yes, you can access MH folders.  See the Pine tech notes for details;
the folder collection spec includes #MH/ but I forget the exact syntax.

Firstly, please try to be a little careful when writing comman line
options in your messages to prevent confusing others... "-i" is _not_ the
"initial keystrokes option" but is instead "start Pine in the Index
Screen".  The option you are really referring to is "-I" (ie, capital i). 

You can enter various "unusual" keystrokes in the -I option's list of
keystrokes using English mnemonics.  I enclose a list below culled from
the pine/init.c source code file's "process_init_cmds" function (in which,
if you have the source code too, you could presumably have found them
too:-) 

	SPACE		(Space)
	CR		(Return)
	TAB		(Tab)
	^char		(Control+char)
	F1...F12	(function keys F1 through F12)
	f1...f12	(ditto)
	UP		(Up arrow)
	DOWN		(Down arrow)
	LEFT		(Left arrow)
	RIGHT		(Right arrow)

Cheers,

Please help us to help you by including what version number of Pine you
are using and which platform (type of computer) it is for.  It _does_
help!

Anyway, your message included the following "Message-Id:" header line:

Message-ID: <Pine.OSF.3.91.961220125021.1542A-100000@InfoNET.st-johns.nf.ca>
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

from which I'm _assuming_ you're using Pine 3.91 for OSF.

So...

Firstly you will need to upgrade to the current version of Pine (3.95),
which is available through anonymous ftp from ftp.cac.washington.edu.

Having got this set up you will then need to go into its Setup
Configuration screen and enable the "print-index-enabled" option.

Having done both of these you can then use the print command in the Index
screen to print either the index itself or the current message (you get to
choose which after giving the Print command).

Cheers,

Sorry, but Pine's "expanded-view-of-addressbooks" is an all or nothing
affair.

And just to add to the Paul's response...

*  The "$O" command (or "Ordered Subject" sort key) is better for sorting
   newsgroups than just "$S" ("Subject" sort).  Ordered subject sorting
   sorts first by subject text and then by date, thereby arranging
   articles sharing a subject into posting order instead of merely the
   order in which they arrived on your news server (often different!:-)

*  The "sort-key" variable in the Setup Configuration screen affects all
   types of folders: both Usenet News and normal (mail and/or news).  You
   cannot have different defaults for News and normal folders.  If you
   want different sorting methods for the two types of folder decide
   which sorting method you will use most frequently and set the default
   to that one, and give "$blah" command manually for the other type of
   folders.

Cheers,

Yes, Pine will handle MH style folders.  A couple of provisos:

*  Pine must have been compiled to include the MH mailbox driver module
(it gets this included by default, so you probably don't have any worries
on this front).

*  You must name the folder properly when telling Pine its name.  This
involves including a magic "#mh" at the approproiate point in its name.
You can find details by:

	1.  Start Pine
	2.  Give the List Folders (L) command
	3.  Ask for help (?)

These help screens tell you about the List Folders screen and, further
down, about naming folders when specifying them to Pine.

(Note that the "#mh" string is NOT part of the filename on disk, just part
of the specification string you give to Pine to identify the folder.)

Cheers,

I suspect that Russell's problem is really just that he sent his
"subscribe" message to the wrong e-mail address...

Majordomo@cac.washington.edu is th e-mail address for joining/leaving
lists, whilst pine-info@cac.washington.edu is the list itself (anything
you send to it gets e-mail to all the other members of the list).

So I believe you want to send a message to

	Majordomo@cac.washington.edu

saying

	subscribe pine-info

The Majordomo software will deduce your e-mail address and name from the
content of the headers of your message.

For more details about subscribing see:

	http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/subscribing.html

Note that the Pine-Info mailing list is bi-directionally gatewayed to the
comp.mail.pine Usenet News group.  So if you prefer reading the articles
through News rather than having them delivered to your mailbox you can do
so.

Cheers,

It's happened twice now in the past twelve hours, and while it's no big
deal, it is curious to me. Twice, in the last twelve hours, I have come
across an entirely blank message: no header, no date, nothing. Even a tap
of the H command for the full header information reveals absolutely
nothing. What does a completely blank message like this mean?

Is is possible to change the user id in Pine? Currently all my mail says 
it comes from tns96@vsonic.fi, as that is my login, but how can I change 
it to tns@vsonic.fi? I can change the domain, but that's of no use to me.

Thanks for any help.

    My best guess is that your Freenet is running some flavor of the
Un*x operating system and that when you login, you get what is called a
restricted shell.  In other words, instead of having access to all
facilities, you have access to only a restricted set of facilities, and
it is set up so that Pine starts up automatically (this is easily
accomplished by an administrator).  I think this sort of thing is
fairly common in freenets.  In short, they are only providing a
restricted set of functions, and that's all you get.  In a manner of
speaking, you may be confined to a box.  Just how big the box is and
how porous its walls are, I don't know.

Hi, I was using PINE on Linux, which has been recently upgraded to Linux
2.0.0. But now I get this message when I try to run PINE:

             Terminal type "vt220", is unknown.

Is it a Linux problem, or PINE, or just "mine" ? I couldn't find any
references to this in Linux manual or PINE configurations...

Thanks in advance,
                         Pau

Dear All,
  I want to store users mail in their home dirs and now I want to use
ipop3d to retrieve mail from there.  Is this possible?  I don't want to
have to use qpopper as I don't like it very much and don't trust it very
much.  Plus I like the IMAP<->POP3 features of ipop3d.

Quickly,
  we are running Pine 3.95 under Solaris.  Here is the scenario I would
like an answer on:
	/1/ While a user is composing a message, her time-limit is reached
and our system logs her out.  When she next logs in will she be able to:
(a) resume her interupted message, 
    or is her message
(b) lost forever?

That is being done, around the middle of each month; last time was on Dec. 
16th.  See, for example (November's posting), URL:

Actually, I've no idea what exactly goes wrong, but you might want to check
the TERM option. 

   Unix Pine uses the following environment variables:
   TERM
          Tells Pine what kind of terminal is being used.


Please refer to the attached technotes for further detail.

Cheers,
Robin

It seems something's gone awry with the Spell Check feature in my files
here . . . perhaps as a result of my own fumbled key strokes while
composing a message.  Can get Spell checking to "kick-in", but it now
takes an unusually long time to complete checking on very brief messages,
then spits out an indicator something akin to "user fork failed" and "too
many processes".

What have I done wrong?  More importantly, how can I make it right again.

Thanks in advance for your assistance.

Dear Pine:

One of my users noticed this, and I don't know if there are any variables
in Pine's setup/Config which will "fix" this or not.

The situation is this:

The original email looks fine on the screen, with the line-wraps working
fine, but when a reply or forward is invoked, the lines don't wrap anymore
and become too-long strings with the $ character at the end.

This is happening when Jerry sends the email, so I've included the message
so you can see an example.

Is there any setting to "fix" or update???


Thanks,

Jane

	Most likely "a".  Howerver, I suggest you do the following since
not all systems react the same....

1.	Login to the system.

2.	Start composing a message with pine.

3.	Walk away from the terminal (or whatever) and have a cup of
	coffee and a danish.  (Wait until you get logged off....)

4.	Login to the system again.

5.	Try composing a message with pine.  

	Do you get a message saying you have a postponed message?

	Some people would call this a "diagnostic" others would call it
"testing".  I like to call it, TIY..."Try it Yourself".

	Regards,

		Ed

As an aside, there is a Unix POP client called "mutt" - do a Web or Archie
search for it.

I have a problem with pine-os2, it won't seem to properly write a
message-id; it leaves everything off after the '@', so the message id's
look something like '<000000.00000@>

The pinerc file is proper, and has all of the appropriate domain names
and all that happy crap. Has anyone ever used the os/2 port, and if you
have, ever experienced this?

    Pine will not do this.  It is not designed to.  Your user needs to
invoke some facility which will do this _before_ Pine enters the
picture, as part of the mail delivery process.  How to do it will vary
according to what operating the incoming mail will be processed on. 
For Un*x systems, you can use .vacation or procmail.

Yes, it is possible, although you may have to recompile the C-client
library to include an extra mailbox driver, then relink Pine and imapd
against the library.  If this doesn't fill you with fear read on...

There are certainly at least two routes open to you: one uses the
"standard" ("Berkeley") mailbox format to store the INBOX folder (this is 
called the "mbox" driver); whilst the other uses a different format called
Tenex (the "Tenex" driver).

Tenex is included by default in the C-client library, so if you decide to
use this one you won't need to recompile anything.  The mbox driver isn't
included as standard.  You can add it by setting the EXTRADRIVERS variable
in the "build" script (or is it in a Makefile? I forget!) to "mbox".  I
_believe_ you can also do it when you give the "build" command simply by
changing this to:

	build xxx EXTRADRIVERS=mbox

where "xxx" is your usual three character platform code.

So which to choose - mbox or Tenex?  (The following thoughts are purely
personal observations; they may be added to/reversed by Others Who Know
More Than I.)

If you are already using the Berkeley mailbox format for your folders and
are happy with its performance then you should probably use the mbox
driver as this will keep things simple for you.

If you are wanting a bit more "oomph" from your mail server you may like
to consider the Tenex format.  This is much more efficient in its memory
use because Tenex messages are a fixed size (whereas Berkeley ones can
change size as their status flags are added/altered).  This fixed size
allows the Tenex driver to build an in-memory index into where the
messages are in the folder and access them from there; the Berkeley driver
has to read the whole folder into memory and keep it there.

There are a couple of Gotchas with the Tenex driver though:

*  For locking to work properly your Tenex folder(s) should be on a disk
local to the machine running the IMAP server software (or your platform
should have reliable locking across NFS/whatever ... something Mark
Crispin really doubts exists (and so do I after some empirical
observation)).  This implies that your users' home directories must be
local to the IMAP server system.

*  You cannot save messages from a mail folder in one format to one in
another.  This means you cannot use a Tenex INBOX and save messages from
it to a Berkeley folder.  If you already have Berkeley folders you will
either need to convert them to Tenex as well, or put up with not being
able to add more messages to them from Tenex folders.  The recommendation
from the Pine Team is to pick one folder format and stick with it for all
your folders.

So how do you use either driver?

To use the mbox driver (having compiled and linked it in) you just need to
create an empty file called "mbox" in your home directory.  Pine and the
imapd will spot this and rip all the mail in your delivery file (eg,
/var/mail/username) and move it across to the mbox file.

Newly arriving mail continues to be delivered to the delivery file, and
gets moved across to the mbox file whenever Pine/imapd starts up, and
periodically thereafter (whenever the check for new mail is performed).

The Tenex driver is used similarly, only this time the empty file you
create in your home directory must be called "mail.txt".  It works in the
same way as the mbox driver.

[See below for a note about mail delivery and "tmail".]

Gotchas?

At one time we used the mbox driver but backed out from using it after
finding a couple of problems...

*  Users were prone to try editing this mysterious "mbox" file with an
editor or (worse) a word processor.  I had to do any amount of patching up
of these to edit out the header junk Word Perfect sprinkles at the start
of the file.  Until the file was fixed Pine/imapd refused to touch it
(rightly) because it was corrupt.  (Note that mail continued to be
delivered to the delivery file in /var/mail/username for the user;
Pine/imapd just couldn't transfer it to the mbox file for them to see it
in/read it from.)

*  If a user ran short of disk quota and had a large message in their
delivery file it couldn't get transferred across to the mbox file
(insufficient quota left).  This prevented the user from being able to
read/delete the big message and all following ones until they had deleted
enough files from their home directory to allow the big message to
transfer across to the mbox file.  (Needless to say this is a Real Fun Way
for students to mess each other up! :-(

What we did here...

After backing out from using the mbox driver to store files in people's
home directories (because of the above problems) we introduced disk quotas
on the delivery directory (/var/mail).  We give people a reasonable soft
disk quota (0.5Mb for students, 4Mb for staff) with a hard quota which is
double their soft one.

This prevented people from letting their INBOX files grow indefinitely
(some people seem remarkably loathe to delete messages from or save them
out of their INBOX!).  It also prevents accidental/deliberate mail loops
filling up the entire disk.

But then...

We were having real performance problems after the latest intake of
students.  We traced this to now having around 9,000+ INBOX/delivery files
stored in the /var/mail directory.

So we decided to split users up into groups (we decided to go for a
structure of /var/mail/NN/username, where NN is the last two digits of the
user's UID).

This *vastly* improved performance, and may be a possible solution to
other sites having such problems who have staff confident of hacking the
mailbox driver code to implement it (fairly straightforward changes, but
just pray that you'll be able to keep the patches working against new
releases of the Pine/imapd software!:-)

Basically we fool the code into checking this /var/mail/NN/username area
instead of the home directory when looking for the delivery file and/or
mail.txt files (we haven't bothered about the mbox file as we no longer
use these).  The advtange is that this area is local to the IMAP server
machine (hence avoids file locking problems over NFS), and is mounted
anywhere else (so users can't edit their mail files with Word Perfect!).

Whilst investigating all this we discovered the "tmail" program included
with the other IMAP utilities (including something to convert between
mailbox formats, eg from Berkeley to Tenex (or back!:-) ) 

This can be used as a pretty much drop-in replacement for /bin/mail, which
most sendmail's use to actually write an arriving message into the INBOX
folder's file.

An advantage of tmail is that it built on top of the C-client library, and
hence fully co-operates with Pine and imapd over mail file locking.

It also knows about the mbox (if lined in) and Tenex drivers.  This allows
it to spot the existence of an mbox or mail.txt file in the user's home
directory and deliver mail stright to it.  This bypasses the normal
delivery file, and hence the overhead of Pine/imapd having to move its
contents across to the mbox/mail.txt file.

Warning: I don't know how "supported" tmail is by the Pine Team.  It seems
to be developing (I have spotted a number of changes go by), but certainly
don't assume it is fully operational and supported without hearing this
from the Pine Team themselves.

I hope this helps a bit...

Cheers,

Perhaps you should ask someone actually at your University (perhaps a

I don't get my pine working under OS/2. After setting up the variables I
tried to start pine. It told me:


Creating subdirectory "a':\mail" where Pine will store its mail
folders.
Error creating subdirectory "a':\mail" : No such file or directory


But there is no option or setting to use a directory with this weired
name. Any help is appreciated.

I doubt there's anything that you personally can do about this to fix it
(indeed, I suspect it is probably already fixed... read on).

"user fork failed" means that the current program (Pine in this case)
couldn't start a subsidiary program it needs to run (in this case the
spelling checker).  This is because...

"too many processes" means that your computer system has its maximum
allowed number of program running simultaneously, and isn't allowing any
more to start.

You need to speak to the system manager of your computer to alert them to
the problem.  Only they can realistically try and sort things out (perhaps
by rebooting the computer).

Moral: Ask your local help desk for support/advice first!

Cheers,

Hi, I used <export TERM="vt100"> in the Linux command line, as someone
told me in the PINE list. It worked immediately, many thanx to you all...

You might want to include a copy of your .pinerc file.

I have a similar setup on my linux box, and it works fine.  The only
difference is that my SMTP server is my linux box (SMTP entry is
blank), but my inbox is a remote machine, and I use IMAP to connect.

I send mail from my linux box (From: header on outgoing mail has my
IMAP server address) but receive mail on the IMAP server.

The obvious answer is to check with them, and share their answer with
us.

Another possibility is to check with a lynx expert.  There should be a
lynx newsgroup group out there.

I should think before I post.

Actually, pine does not have to be a daemon to do this.  If there was
a way to send a message from the command line using pine, you could
put the entry in your .forward file.

That being said, the "vacation" program I mentioned above is more
sophisticated in that it sends messages to the same email address
no more than once a week.  So a user can send you repeat messages, and
not get the same auto-reply for every message.

Is there something different about installing Pine under Red Hat Linux 4
on a DEC Alpha as opposed to installing it under regular linux? I grab the
file from ftp.cac.washington.edu, uncompress, tar it, type

./build lnx

and get no compilation. Any idea wy?

	I'm not at familiar with Linux.  However, it may help others
to understand your situation if they had an idea of what exactly you
are seeing.  

	When you say "get no compilation" what does that mean?  Does
that mean nothing is output to your screen and you simply get the
system prompt back?  No error messages or warnings at all?

Well, a whole bunch of stuff gets output to the screen, and it all goes by
really fast. IT takes about three minutes, and there are some warnings
that zoom by that I can't place. When all is said and done, there are no
compiled files to run and no links in the pine3.95/bin subdirectory.

	OK....well you need to capture what is going wrong.  I suspect
that the very last 10 lines or so of the build may give a clue to
other.  I don't know what shell you are using so it is difficult
to judge.  But you can try something like:

./build lnx >& build.out

	which may (depending on the shell) save STDOUT and STDERR to
the file build.out.  Then you can read what is going on and if need
be send that as an attachment to someone more familiar with the OS
you are using.

To Whom It May Concern:

Somehow my INBOX has become a read-only folder, and I can't seem to find
out how I changed it.  Subsequently I have not been able to delete the one
message in the folder.
Please let me know what I need to do to remedy the problem

Thank you

This concerns the status of Kevin Kraft's inbox.
The read-only status of the INBOX is not allowing me to receive messages
so could you possibly send the responses to dry@wam.umd.edu or call 301

Sorry if this is a repeat message . . . my news reader seemed to be 
having problems posting, so I'm trying with a different program.

I had heard that PINE can read from POP servers by editing .pinerc.  Is 
there a way to configure PINE to read messages from the server without 
removing messages on there already?

If possible, please reply via e-mail.

Thanks,

Pine can communicate directly with POP3 servers.  Undocumented feature.

Tell your .pinerc to do inbox-path like so:

   inbox-path={your.mail.host/110}inbox

Enjoy your treat. ;)

Mime-Version: 1.0

Is there any way to save a group of different e-mail addresses under a
single folder name?  Case in point is that more then a couple of my friends
e-mail me from different accounts, I'd like to be able to save them all
to the correct folder without having to manually type in the name of
the folder.

ie) Jonathan Price has price@cdw.brazil.com and lowry@central.services.net
as e-mail addresses.  When I hit 's' I'd like it to offer me [price] no
matter which address he e-mails me from.  But when I type 'price' in
the to: field of a compose, I'd like it to always go to lowry@central.
services.net.

I've figured out save-by-nick-then-by-sender, but I can't have multiple
addresses under the same nick, except by creating a mailing list.  And
I don't want to send to all of their addresses every time I send them
a message....

Adding a "folder name" field to the address book would fix this quickly.
Or perhaps keeping track of the folder name last used for a particular
receive address and then offering that as the default the next time
pine sees that address appear.  This second option involves adding a 
new (or appending to an existing) configuration file and is probably
more work but is potentially more powerful.

If you don't know of any way to do this in the existing system, could
you offer pointers on which files/what part of the code would need
modification?  I can program, but it seems like the pine-source learning
curve might be pretty steep.

Thank you!

Hi,

I recently installed Netscape Mail Server on host2. host1 is the current
imap server machine. If I set my inbox to {host1}, I can access mail on
host1 and if I set it to {host2}, I can read mail from host2.

What I would like to do is set inbox to {host1} and define a
folder-collection for mail on host2 (perhaps as "host2mail {host2}[]" ?!).
But, though I can login I cannot access my mail on host2.(I get an error
saying empty folders). Is there
something wrong with my approach, syntax?

Would appreciate any help/suggestions/pointers to a FAQ ref, etc.
TIA,
Kiran.
P.S: I can do a "g {host2}" and get to my mail on host2, so why can't
{host2}[] be a valid folder.

Pine documents say:

You will get a message via Pine at the end of each month asking you about
your sent-mail folders. First it asks you if you want to rename (and thus
save) your current sent-mail folder. Then it asks if you want to delete
any sent-mail folders (and all the messages they contain) from previous
months and the current month. 

But PC-Pine has not done this for me in 3 months since installation.

Any idea why?

PC-Pine 3.95 running under Win95.  The folder's name is the PC default
"sentmail" rather than "sent-mail".  Thanks,

Yes, but the time I installed my PINE, 3.95 was a dream!
I can't remember the release that I used, but I remember that I browsed
the MAN and more, without find anything about POP feature. I came across
the POP feature reading the PINE Web page; there was only a hidden and
little note on how to do this but nothing else. This note has made the
PINE fortune! In fact, here (CSD-UCLA) everybody seems to use Procmail
with Elm. I, instead, I like the old POP fashion.
Every time, POP gives me the same shiver of uncorking a bottle of
CAMPAGNE!
Happy new year.

What I don't understand is, if you thing it's such a PITA to help
someone (for whatever the reason) why do it?

I help people with computer problems for a living.  I've found lots of
ways to tell people to RTFM w/o being rude or snide.

...and pets are lost or turn up missing every year!
Protect your loved ones today! 

Think about all the things you do to protect your loved ones. Isn't there
one more thing you should do? 

Child and Pet ID Kits have been around for years, but most of them haven't
changed with the years. Traditional ID Kits allow you to compile valuable
information about your child or pet that you can use in the event your child or
pet is missing. We are responding to the rapid changes in technology. We know
that any ID Kit just isn't good enough. 

Our ID Kit is quite different! You supply us with up to three photos and pertinent
information about your child or pet and we create a SAFETYDISK. In PC or MAC
format, SAFETYDISK is a 3 1/2" disk that contains photos and valuable
information that could help law enforcement agencies in the search for a missing
child or pet. 

What makes our kit so unique is that each SAFETYDISK is actually
pre-formatted for the World Wide Web. SAFETYDISK can be put on any
Internet server within seconds and displayed to millions and millions of people
who might spot your child or pet!

Not only will it get rid of the warning but it also lets pine display
ISO-8859-1 characters correctly. I used to receive e-mail from Europe that
included some of those special European letters (äÇöß etc.) and Pine would
not display them until I added ISO-8859-1 to the character set field in Pine
setup. All the English letters and numbers are included in ISO-8859-1. There
is no problem composing in English when using ISO-8859-1. In fact MS Mail
uses this set by default (instead of US-ASCII). Of course, if you use ALL
the special characters in US-ASCII extensively, I guess, ther might be a
problem using ISO-8859-1 but I have never experienced it in my three years
on the net.

	It seems that what you want to do is a bit out of scope for
what/how pine was designed to work.

	I'd suggest using a mail filter program such as "procmail" for
which you can design rather complex rules on how to save incoming mails.
This should solve your problem without modification to pine.

	Regards,

	Look in your pinerc file for the following:

# Set by Pine; controls beginning-of-month sent-mail pruning.
last-time-prune-questioned=97.1

	maybe it is set to some date in the far future?

    If you are using the default (or not too heavily modified) format
for the index listing, then Pine will show you which messages are
_answered_.  Obviously, unanswered messages are those which have not
been answered. :-)  The format of the index listing (in later versions
of Pine) is controlled by the index-format field toward the bottom of
the configuration screens.  There is a good bit of online help.  If you
take the default or specify STATUS or FULLSTATUS, then an answered
message will have an 'A' in the status field.  Just look for any
message *without* an 'A'.

My pop account needs my username and my password as additional parameters. Is
that possible, too?

The stated problem has cleared itself since my last session -- spell check
working as normal once again.

Just answer (N)o when it asks.  You can also disable that feature, but why
not leave the option available?

We have several Pine users.  As far as I know all, except one, are having
no problems.  THE ONE, however, is driving me crazy.

The problem is that when she prints the message, depending on the
printer, the prin is so small you can't read it, or so big it can't fit on
the page. She has no probems with other printing jobs, just from Pine.

I've tried changing printers, no difference.

I've tried changing the printer setups, nothing.

To further confuse me, she is able to print from the Net, using Netscape.

Thanks for any suggestions.

You can just download your saved-messages folder as a file and read it
offline. Should work no problem.

Hi,

I was using Pine3.91, and have upgraded to 3.95. It's much more cool. But
facing one inconvenience. When I send a mail in 3.95 by pressing Ctrl-X,
it seems, it tries to send the mail to the MTA (on our case sendmail)
immediately, which in turn return success after looking up the host name
of the address etc. As a result sendmail mail has become a bit
problematic, specially if some nameserver is down etc. So how I can I
change the setup on 3.95 for complete background mail sending?

I compiled the sources on a 1.2.13 Linux kernel.

Please cc me too when replying if you're reading this on a
newsgroup/mailing list. 

Thanx.

Often times when I am in Pine and I either send a message or try to Quit
, I get this error message popping up:

[New mailbox modification time but apparently no changes]

Other times I get a message saying INBOX has been closed due to an
access error.

Can anyone give me any ideas as to what could be going wrong here?  This
happens quite a lot.

 Good idea.. But I remember reading somewhere that the latest versions
of sendmail running today plan to  (or already ) WILL NOT accept
SMTP connections from any host just WILLY NILLY ! This , of course,
is to avoid the slew of security problems that sendmail has been
famous for in the past, including email masquerading, anon remailing,
spamming, etc! And also, this would work only if
the machine Pine is running on is DIRECTLY connected the the
Internet. Now me, I am behind a corporate firewall
and I can directly accss only machines within my domain (sob)!

	Actually, the way to do it would be to edit the pinerc file at
the line:

# Set by Pine; controls beginning-of-month sent-mail pruning.
last-time-prune-questioned=97.1

	And set it to a date in the far future.  As to "why not leave
the option available"?  Because that is not the behaviour the 
original poster wants, period.

    Just for information, I use Pine 3.94 under a flavor of Un*x.  Pine
is MIME-compliant.  When it receives an email with both text/plain and
text/html using MIME standards, it can handle it.  Unfortunately, by
default it displays the unrendered text/html and tells me that the
text/plain is in an attachment.  It will show me this just dandy
provided I go through additional keystrokes.  So far I am unaware of
any configuration option to Pine (at my version level) which will
switch the order of preference.  I subscribe to one mailing list in
which this situation is beginning to show up more and more.

Thanks! However, it's not the status of messages in the
folder index which I was asking about, but of the _folders_
themselves. That is, is there any way to tell Pine to show
me whether there are unanswered messages inside a given
folder without actually listing its contents?

Again, any help is thoroughly appreciated!

I think it has something to do with the fact that doesn't seem quite
perfected, yet.  Yes, it functions and all, but, one seems to have to
restart pine in order to retrieve new mail.

I have Pine 3.95 and Pico 2.9.   I have set up Pico as an external
editor and I can successfully ^_ to use Pico.  What I would like to do
is use Pico as an external editor from the main menu of Pine.  I also
want to be able to print from Pico to a system printer.   In other
words, Pico would be a great word processor if I could choose a
printer.  Any suggestions?

I haven't tried this. I have pointed my entire inbox at the POP server by 
setting inbox-path={host/pop3}inbox. But then I either have to choose 
between by POP server or my local one, and not both. This method you have 
here is better (if it works for me.)

How can you send outgoing mail through the POP server using Pine 3.91? 
Even with the method I have been using, still mail gets sent from my own 
account, and not the POP server. 

Thanks!

To the best of my knowledge (I wrote it), this is the case.  The code is
very careful when it is root, and it setuids itself to the user as soon as
it is logged in.

It's also because when most people think of POP, they assume *offline*
access, which Pine doesn't do yet.  (Pine uses POP in "quasi-online"
mode --within the limitations of POP-- so the connection to the server
is maintained during the session.)

By the way, the Pine FAQ has a section on using POP.

	This is an error which is "local" to your system.  Your system is
trying to tell you that you are using more disk space than you are
alloted.  You can do several things.

1.	Delete some existing files to create more space.
2.	Contact the system admin of your system and request more
	allotment.

	Hope this helps,

hi,

i am trying to load slirp or tia to optimise my shell connection. i am
using pine 3.93 and have a 14.4 shell line with a p100 chip.

now, i have downloaded slirp as shareware but those need to be compiled
and i don't have a unix machine nor does my service provider very
enthusiastic about the whole idea.

so is there a way of getting a .exe version of slirp or tia. and what
config changes do i need to make to pine?

thanks and bye,

I'd the same problem. After some experiences, only "raw-printing" was
possible (without some print-filter, no layout, mismatching of any special
latin-1-chars).
Now I've setup my own - working fine - printer:

Enter name ...:             MyPrinterName
Enter command for printer:
cat $1 > /tmp/tmp1 && lpr -Pyour_printer /tmp/tmp1 && rm /tmp/tmp1
                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ this didn't work in pine as
"Standard UNIX print command" (why?... I don't know)

Hope, it was an usefull hit.

If you're on a system that has egrep, you can do this:

 egrep "^X-Status: [^A]" foldername

If anything shows up, you have unanswered messages.  You could
do the following to find out how many unanswered messages:

 egrep "^X-Status: [^A]" foldername | wc -l

What this does is look through the folder for every line that 
starts with `X-Status: ' followed by anything other than `A' (which
means answered.

Good luck,
Nancy

I used to use this method, it's nice to be able to read local mail 
and remote mail by picking another folder.  ...now I use fetchmail to 
throw it all into /usr/spool/mail/username

It's been a while since I used 3.91, but check if you can set 'smtp-
server' in Pine's configuration.  If it's blank, Pine will use the 
system's MDA (mail delivery agent) - usually sendmail or smail, but 
if you set it to something like 'mailhost.yourisp.com' it'll send the 
mail 'through the POP server'.

If you mean, how do you get the From: tag to show your 'real' e-mail 
address, that's a whole other ballpark.  You'll need to recompile 
Pine, but I think you'll probably have to upgrade to a newer version 
(3.95 is current) before you can recompile it to ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM.

In my experience, I have found that the Unix program Procmail handles
this quite well.  I use it to filter messages into different folders
within Pine depending on who they are from or what subject is used.  

I also use it to filter junk/spam email to /dev/null when needed.  I
have a nice little blacklist going in my rc.maillists file.  :)

Thanks for the warning.  I've entered this prick's email address into my
Procmail filter file, so now all his email will go to /dev/null before
it even reaches my inbox.

"No, but there is a better way"...

PC-Pine offers you the option of saving your username and password because
on the whole: a) PCs are single user machines and locked in people's
offices and so can have passwords saved away in this manner; b) are
untrustworthy in a general sense because software can be run by arbitrary
users to make them do Naughty Things.

The latter makes it impractical to use the more general protection
mechanism that is used by the UNIX variants of Pine.  This is the "rsh
mechanism".

Basically you need to do two things:

1.  Set your IMAP server software up to allow pre-authenticated
connections.

This is done very easily simply by making a symbolic link so that
/etc/rimapd points to the real imapd executable.

2.  Set up rsh access to your IMAP server computer.

This is a little trickier, and must be done with care.  Bacially you need
to tell the IMAP computer to "trust" (allow access without having to
specify a username and password) from certain other hosts you use.  This
is the standard "rsh" command, which alllows you to execute a command on a
trusting host without having to specify a username and password.  It knows
the username to use because of the wonderfully magic rsh software.

Try reading your man pages about "rsh" (the command to do the remote
command), ".rhosts" (the per-user file which controls access) and
"hosts.equiv" (the systemwide file which controls access).  (The latter
two man pages may in fact be one and the same.)

Pine tries to open a pre-authenticated rsh connection before failing down
to a standard connection (to port 143) and prompting for a username and
password.

Cheers,

When you compiled Pine did you find and uncomment the "BACKGROUND_POST"
definition within the pine/osedp/os-xxx.h file?

If this *EXPERIMENTAL* feature is supported on your flavour of UNIX you
should then have an "enable-background-sending" option in your Setup
Configuration screen.

See the Release Notes ("R" at the Main Menu) for more information (search
for "background" by giving the command "W" then "backgorund".).

Cheers,

PINE (for UNIX) has got POP feature. I use it!

I do not know about PINE for PC. Chek carefully the PINE WEB page.
Try to replace 110 with pop3.

Check the permissions of your INBOX (could be /usr/mail/kmk). Make sure
that it has 'rw' permissions for yourself and the group.

Hope it helps,

I'm new to Pine and would like to know if I can save my messages to a
floppy disk. I'm going to the mainland and would like to be able to
save my important messages.

Also, when I start to type each letter is duplicated. Does that have
something to do with the echo setting?

My newserver is VERY unreliable. Would you also send an email reply to
me at leslie@interpac.net. 

Thanks,

When reading a long message sometimes I would like to save a few lines

cumbersome if the message is several pages long and I only want to save 5
lines of it.   
Any helpful pointers, suggestions ?

Subject: Sug (ID IG4Y8): Mouse support in Pine 3.95 in an Xterm
Message-ID: <Pine.SOL.3.95.970106133142.27324C-100000@joshua.insight.att.com>

I am using Pine 3.95 on Solaris 2.5 in an Xterm window.
I am using 'vim' editor as my alternate editor all the time.

Problem:
 Whenever I first launch up Pine with all the mouse features enabled, it works
fine and recognizes my mouse clicks and takes the appropriate action. 

	Now when I compose a new mail or a reply, an action which fires up my
alternate editor, this editor is also mouse-aware. It interprets my mouse
clicks and does with it whatever it is designed to do. 

	When I exit the editor and send the reply/mail and go back to the main
Index window, or any other Pine screen, my mouse clicks are totally ignored.
Pine seems to have lost control of the mouse!

	When I now exit Pine and launch it again, the whole scenario is
repeated. i.e. it initially is mouse-aware, but as soon as I launch a editor
that is also mouse-aware, Pine loses the battle!

	I use the 'slrn' newsreader with 'vim' , both of which are mouse-aware
programs and I dont have this problem there! Looks like something peculiar to
Pine 3.95.

	Please look into it and let me know what can be done.

Thanks,
--Vikas

Then I run "build sun" with the results below. Can someone tell

Subject: Pico and nn: cutting off long lines?
Date: 6 Jan 1997 22:11:40 GMT
Message-ID: <5artas$85k@brachio.zrz.TU-Berlin.DE>

I'm using Pico 2.9 (because unlike many other editors it does automatic
line wrapping) as my default editor for nn 6.5.1.
Now when I'm writing an article which contains a header line longer than
255 or 256 characters (I'm not exactly sure) this line gets cut off,
meaning only the first 255 or 256 characters are imported into the editor.
Such a situation can occur for exaple for the References: line when doing
a followuop to a faily long thread. Needless to say it's not nice to have
that line being chopped off.
What can I do about it short of using a different editor? Maybe
recompiling pine? Is there any version of pine which does not have a fixed
maximum of characters per line?

What do the RFCs say about the maximum length a Usenet news or email
header line is supposed to have?

I get access to my Unix server by phone with a MAC. Connecting in VT100
i have instructed my MAC VT 100 teminal emulation program to start PINE
and put username and password automatically.
Please note, MAC runs a simply, tiny VT100 emulation program, not a Mail
program (such as EUDORA) in TCP/IP which requires a Powerful hardware
(>386).

THIS MEANS THAT YOU REQUIRE A SIMPLY VERY OLD MAC OR EVEN 8088 (XT!!) TO
CHECK AND WRITE YOUR MAIL.

Not only, you do not require even TCP/IP support, that normally it is
not freeware.
AND you need just a inexpensive 1200 or 2400 baud modem! Not a 14400 or
more.

If the Unix server has got LYNX capability,
YOU CAN EVEN NAVIGATE THE NET WITH THIS SIMPLY EQUIPEMENT 
(of course without graphic. Do you really need it?).
Note that if your terminal emulator has got Z-maodem capability, when
LYNX use ftp instead of http, Lynx is capable to download files from the
net in the Unix server but also, on request, to download them, in
Z-modem protocol, from the net directly in you local terminal.

Do you need more ? :-/

	Without hacking the code, it is not possible to send an
anonymous e-mail with pine.  

	You'll have to use other means...which is out of scope for
this discussion group.

	What version of pine are you using?  If you go to setup/config
add search for the word "custom" you may find:

        OPTION: Customized-Headers
 
You may add your own custom headers to all outgoing messages.  Each header
you specify here must include the header tag (Reply-To:, Approved:, etc.)
and may optionally include a value for that header.  If you want to see
these custom headers each time you compose a message, you must add them to
your default composer headers list (see above), otherwise they become part
of the rich header set which you only see when you press the rich header
(Ctrl-R) command.
 
	(BTW, some people call that RIF (Reading Is Fundamental) while
others call it RTFM (I won't translate that one....) but if I (or others)
were to say that we would risk being compared to a type of pocket bread).

	(More, BTW.  Kind of ignore the last paragraph.  It refers back
to a pervious post...but I just had to get it out.  Sorry.  No
offence intended or implied.)

	Good questions....

1.	You can't view html format "files" since the builtin editor of
pine is not html aware.  So, the MIME designation of text/html is not
supported via a builtin method.

2.	To view html format "file" you will need to make use of a
mailcap file.  The mailcap file is used to designate a mapping between
an MIME type/sub-type and an external application.  I don't happen to
have the documentation handy on the format of mailcap entries.  You
should first check the pine release notes and then the "mailcap" entry
in setup/config to see if they posess pointers to additional information.
If not, feel free to email me directly and I'll do some digging for you.

	Regards,

	Exported?  No.  

	Why not "save" the messages to a file.  This will save the
entire message (header included) into a file as is.  This means, of
course, that if the attachments were MIME attachments they will still
be MIME.  Pine is not configurable to convert between MIME formated and
uuencoded messages.

	No, not in the current release.

I can't remember the exact settings, but you CAN do it in your mailcap
file so that text.plain gets shown instead of text/html.

It should be noted this command should only be used if you want to
sent truly mass mailings.  If you just want to send mail to
a dozen friends or so this command will not work.  But if you want to
send mail to 1000s (or 10000s) of strangers around the world, I
enthusiastically recommend this.

If your system administrator or ISP might object to you sending such
mail, you should not ask about the readmail (rm) command before doing
this, because they might get suspicious.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Dear Pine Users,
	I use pine on a college unix system, to which I telnet from my 
home computer.  The problem I run into is the obscured current line.  
Whenever I move my cursor to any given line, in most of the interactive 
pine screens, the cursor, instead of blinking at the start of the line, 
brings with it a bar (of the same color as the text) which obscures the 
whole line.  This means, for example, that I can't see the current 
message information in the inbox, and have to move to the next, or 
previous, message to read it.  I also can't see the status line or the 
command keys in the command lines at the bottom.  More importantly, I 
can't read the line that pops up at the bottom when pine requires more 
information from me or doesn't understand my command.  Thus I don't know 
what pine is telling me, besides the few basic communications that I am 
familiar with.
	I would really appreciate if somebody who thinks they know what 
this problem could be would contact me.  Is this a function of pine or my 
telnet program?  As I am not a subscriber to the list, please reply to me 
directly at  vitz@eden.rutgers.edu
	I thank all of you for your attention and apologize for the 
distraction.
					Sincerely,
					David Gorvits

this system-wide, so if it's a configuration I need to add or change in
the pine.conf file, that would be lovely.

Thanks!

	The fact that your "highlight" (bar) color is the same color as
the characters is normally a setting in your telnet client.

	If you can't figure out how to fix your telnet client then try
going to setup/config and setting:

            [ ]  assume-slow-link

	It will replace the highlight with ">".

Dear sir
    I have received an e-mail from New York University school of medicine.
It has a message with 4 attachments: 16KB textonly, 16KB dostext, 24KB
dostext and 24KB worddoc. All these attachments are in OCTET-STREAM. These
can't be viewed by the Pine software on which my connection is working.
The attachments have been saved in the home directory. Information
displayed about the attachments is as follows
                    Type               Application
                    Subtype            OCTET STREAM
                    Encoding           BASE64
                    Parameters         Name= <Niersh01>Textonly  
                    Description        " "
                    Approx. size       16,402 bytes
                    Display method     can't, unknown attachment format
          I shall be grateful if any body is able to fix the bug, and also
help me know how to view and copy the files from home directory.
       With regards
      Gurcharan Singh

	There is no bug.

	The MIME type application/octet-stream is the most basic way to
transfer a binary file.  There is no indication as to what application
may be associated with the attached file.  Had it been image/gif, or
application/msword, then you may (or may not) have an entry in a mailcap
file which tells pine what application to call in order to render the
attachment.

	Since it was sent as application/octet-stream you will have
to make some "assumptions" about the content, save the data to disk,
manually call an application to reder the attachment.  For example,
there is a good chance that MSWord will be the application needed
to render "24KB worddoc".

	If you don't know what application should be used for each
attachment and you can't determine it my trial and error then you will
need to contact the sender and ask them....

	Ed

Hi,
	I am a final year student and am in need of some help setting up 
Procmail as I need it for my final year project.  I downloaded a version 
form the Web and followed the instructions on setting it up from :

	http://www.cs.ruu.nl/wais/html/na-dir/mail/filtering-faq.htm

 	I cannot get this to work at all, when it is installed I can recieve no 
mail in my area, I have discovered that when I remove the .forward file I 
can then recieve mail.  The forward file contains the line :

"|IFS=' ' && exec /usr/local/bin/procmail -f- || exit 75 #nancym#"

where the path has been corrected to my version of procmail
and nancym has been replaced by my user name

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated

Many Thanks

Actually, i use

and I confirm; it is undocumented.
 
Does anyone knows why?

But then you will get different results when you resize the screen/window
of Vi while it is running when the "last character" have moved position.
That's why I find VIM's "textwidth" variable so handy -
you can set an explicit and to a line.  :-)

Hi,

Thanks for the reply and the clarification about the g {host2} command. I
checked the tech notes at washington.edu but I still am not able to make
it work. But this time I think it is because I don't exactly know how to
specify the path to the mailbox. My mail mailbox is in
/var/spool/mailbox/kiran and so I tried "remote
{host2}/var.../mailbox/kiran/[]"  and the relative path from my home dir
but wasn't able to access the folder collection.
The error I get reads:
"**Empty List** Select here to try Re-Expanding"
TIA,
Kiran.

Are your folders in your home directory on host2?  If not, you need to
specify the path (either absolute or relative to your home directory)
between "{host2}" and "[]".  For details, see

	http://www.washington.edu/pine/tech-notes/config-notes.html#collections

What is the exact error message?

"g {host2}" is equivalent to "g {host2}INBOX" which has special rules
for determining its location.  All other folders are relative to your
home directory.

Hi,
  I get this error message when I save a message to a folder:

error creating /mail/xxx.lock  no such file or directory

I read part of the Pine FAQ and saw that creating a xxx.lock file is one 
of Pine's locking mechanisms, but how to I get the error message to stop? 
Is there something I can do from the end-users' standpoint, or is it 
something on my ISP's system admin side? Please email me if you can shed 
any light on this. Thanks you.

... not at all undocumented. Read the PINE FAQ at cac.washington.edu

Hello everybody --

I apologize in advance if this is a FAQ; I wasn't able to find the
answer in the ``Pine Questions and Answers''
<URL:http://www.washington.edu:1180/pine/QandA/>, though.

With a patch (PHNE_4040 and its later replacements), sendmail on HP-UX
9.x can do "reverse aliasing", i.e. it can map the "From:" field:

	user@host  ->  name.surname@domain

on the outgoing mail.

It works fine with the HP-supplied elm, but not with Pine.  I am
guessing that Pine bypasses this setup by using its internal mail
daemon.  I would like Pine _always_ use /usr/lib/sendmail instead of its
own, along with its settings.  Only setting now empty smtp-server line
in the configuration file doesn't seem to work.  What am I doing wrong?

Thank you in advance,

Primoz

I've developed a software that purges new mail messages in /var/mail, and
it worked fine until some users switched from ELM to PINE.  How does PINE
separate the messages?  I thought a good start was to look for "From"
(does it also use linefeeds?), but this can be a problem if the body of
messages contain "From" as well.  Somehow PINE is smart enough to handle
the messages.  Any ideas?

I just crashed out of Unix pine while trying to send a message
and got this error message:

 Problem detected: "Out of free storage".
 Pine Exiting.
 Floating exception

What does this mean and which machine is the problem on.
I was:

 * logged on to machine a
 * responding to a message that was on machine b (accessed
   via IMAP)
 * using IMAP to save a copy of the message I was trying to
   to send on machine c
 * using an smtp server on machine d

So, was this a problem on machine a, b, c, or d and what kind
of problem is it?

Thanks,
Nancy

I can't get the display-filter to work as I wish.

I have a program (in ADA96) which filters the standard-IO and replaces
some tokens with others.

I want pine to activate the filter when for instance the token "{" is
occurred in the text.

I have tried the following in .pinerc;

display-filters="{" /users/dtek/d95/d95wahl/src/ada/translate/program

 ... but without result.

What is wrong?

	I have access to some newsgroups on my local server only via
authentication, otherwise they'll turn up a "not-found" I've read that
pine 3.95 allows authentication at the news server, but I can not figure
out how to specify that it should authenticate, what must I do to get pine
to login to the news server? It connects just fine for reading and
posting, but if I want to see these certain groups, well, I must
authenticate ...

	TIA, and if any replies could be Cc:ed to email I'd greatly
appreciate, because then I can't miss the reply. :)

Subject: using lockf with pine?

My site wants to use lockf as the primary locking scheme across mail platforms.
What do I have to do to configure pine to do this? I saw in c-client/flock.c
what appears to be code to do this, but I am currently confused what to
set where in the configuration, which turns out to be on Digital Unix 
(have been using OSF as the config)

	Sounds like the news server has a problem with disk space.
Not much pine can do to help on that one....

I've noticed that now that we've switched to 3.95 pine doesn't save my
sent messages in the sent-mail folder.  I checked all the options in the
config and didn't seem to find the appropriate feature.  Am I missing
something simple?

Date: 6 Jan 1997 09:31:58 GMT
Message-ID: <5aqgqe$bre$1@zephyrus-fddi.coventry.ac.uk>


Please find enclosed the patches to convert 3.9x (it was actually done
on 3.95, but it should work on all of the 9 versions) to support DSN 
for sendmail 8.8.

It provides a switch in the configuration screen to support DSN.

When this has been turned on, you will be asked if you want delivery
notification when you send the mail (^X in compose).  Sendmail will
then mail you back a DSN in a normal mail message.

If people have problems with these patches (legitimate problems please, not 
diff/patch problems), please mail me and I will try and have a look, 
but nothing is guaranteed.

Everytime I enter Pine the message "you have new mail" appears even 
though no new messages exist.  What is the problem?  How do I correct it?

Thanks for your help.

Subject: Re: Pine 3.91 Most Frequently Asked Questions

Once I have gained access to my unix box I type:pine.

The system automatically logs me on then asks for my password which was 
assigned to me by the University of Ottawa.  How do I change the 
password?  Going into setup, then password does not work.  It seems that 
I can not change the generic assigned password needed upon entering Pine.

Hi,

	I'm running pine3.95 on Solaris.  

	I've run into a problem with an MTA which is ESMTP 8BITMIME
compliant.  This MTA also supports downgrading when passing a message
to the next hop.  If the next hop does not support 8BITMIME it will
attempt to downgrade.

	If pine is set to enable-8bit-esmtp-negotiation the attachments
it produces encoded in base64 will have their end of lines like so:

di5jYy5udGh1LmVkdS50dz4NClJlY2VpdmVkOiBmcm9tIGNkc2h1YjEwMC5j^M
ZGMuY29tIGJ5IGNhbHZpbi50d250cGUuY2RjLmNvbSB3aXRoIEVTTVRQOyBU^M
dWUsIDcgSmFuIDE5OTcgMTA6MjU6NDAgKzA4MDANClJlY2VpdmVkOiBmcm9t^M

	In other words the lines end in 015 012.

	If pine is set *not* to enable-8bit-esmtp-negotiation the
attachments it produces encoded in base64 will have their end of lines
like so: 

di5jYy5udGh1LmVkdS50dz4NClJlY2VpdmVkOiBmcm9tIGNkc2h1YjEwMC5j
ZGMuY29tIGJ5IGNhbHZpbi50d250cGUuY2RjLmNvbSB3aXRoIEVTTVRQOyBU
dWUsIDcgSmFuIDE5OTcgMTA6MjU6NDAgKzA4MDANClJlY2VpdmVkOiBmcm9t

	In other words they simply end with 012.

	When the MTA needs to perform downgrading it fails if the
line ends with 015 012 stating that the attachment is invalid base64.

	Regards,

		Ed

	Is the senario:

1.	Log-in to unix box with a "user-name" and "password".
2.	Type "pine".
3.	Pine starts and displays a username, you hit return or supply a UN
4.	Pine starts and displays a password prompt, you enter a password.
5.	You are into pine.

	And you want to change the password on #4 but can't?

	Thanks for a better understanding of your situation.

The question is really not so much "How does Pine separate messages in a
folder?" but "Which mailbox format are you using?"

Whereas Elm, as far as I recall, supports only one/a few mailbox formats
Pine supports many.  How the messages are stored and separated can be very
different in each format, so it _is_ important which one you are using.

That said, most places use the so-called "Berkeley" format.  With this
each message is of the format:

From blah blah blah
Header1: value
Header2: value
Header3: value
				<--- empty line (important!)
...text of message...

Particular points to note:

*  Each message is introduced by a line starting "From " (note the
   trailing space; this differentiates the line from the "From:" header
   line).

*  The text after the "From " is often in a variety of formats, and its
   content shouldn't really be relied upon (eg, Pine rewrites it when
   resaving the mailbox).  Use the proper "HeaderN: value" lines instead.

*  The empty line after the last header signifies the end of the headers,
   and the start of the message body text.  This prevents software getting
   confused over initial lines of a message which happen to look like
   header lines.

*  The mail software (delivery softare, Pine, etc) almost invariably
   "quotes" any lines within a message body which start "From " to become
   ">From".  This prevents spurious start-of-message's.  (But note that
   Pine has, as far as I recall, an option to turn this quoting off
   somewhere, although it is rarely used I guess!)

Cheers,

Either:

1)  Delete some of your files, or

2)  Ask the people who look after your computer systems for some more disk
    space allowance (disk quota).

"Disk quota" is a means whereby Mean And Nasty Systems Administrators
(such as myself;-) can limit the amount of storage space someone can make
use of on the computer.  Every time you save a file to the computer's disk
it uses up some storage space; every time you delete one of your files it
releases the space that file used.

When you have used up all your storage allowance (your "disk quota") you
can't create or enlarge any of your files.  So you either have to release
some space (by deleting some of your files), or ask the people who look
after the computer system you are using for a larger disk quota.

As you can see this is something that has to be done by yourself or people
at your site who look after your computer; we -- random people around the
world -- can't do anything to resolve the problem for you.

This is why it is usually best when confronted with such an error message
to ask someone (a Help Desk?) at your site for assistance in the first
instance.  They can usually advise you and help you correct any problem
faster and more effectively than we can.

However if you think you have found a bug in Pine, or have a suggestion
about improving it, then the people in this forum will be pleased to hear
from you.

Cheers,

I can confirm Ed's diagnosis: the real problem is that the News Server you
are trying to use has run out of storage space for receiving new articles
(either posted to it by people such as yourself, or received from its
neighbouring news servers).

When this happens the news server "throttles" itself so as to prevent any
further articles arriving.  Depending on how it has been configured it may
(usually does) allow people to continue _reading_ News, but they can't
post.

If someone does try and post an article the news server returns an error
message which the news reading software, in this case Pine, reports to
the user.

I suggest you contact the person who administers your Usenet News server
and check that they are aware of the problem; only they will be able to
fix things up.

As an aside, this is another good example of a case where someone's best
course of action would really have been to consult a someone/a Help Desk
at their site, rather than asking random people around the world.

Cheers,

Pine will prompt you to enter authentication information when the news
server tells it that it can't do something without authenticating; there
is nothing to configure manually.

Your problem is that you're in a bit of a halfway house: the most
common scenarios are:

1.  Unrestricted access to users for reading or posting.

2.  Unrestricted access for reading, but must authenticate before a
    posting is accepted.

3.  Must authenticate before any reading or posting is allowed.

Pine 3.95 handles all the above scenarios without any manual
configuration.

However it sounds like your server allows limited news reading (and
posting?) without authentication, and access to additional newsgroups
after authentication?

I'm not too sure whether Pine will interwork with this setup (Pine Team?).

The reason for my suspicion is that when it sends a "GROUP" command to the
server to try and open one of the additional groups your news server is
responding something like "No such group" (because you aren't
authenticated).  This is the same message that would be sent out if the
group really didn't exist.

Pine is watching for the "Authentication required for command" message to
trigger it into prompting you to supply it with the necessary information.
Because it doesn't see this it doesn't ask you, and without it your news
server won't grant access.

So my horrible suspicion is that you may not be able to get Pine -- at
least not version 3.95 -- to give you access to the additional newsgroups
on your server.  Your only hope would be to see if your News Administrator
might consider moving to one of the above three setups.

Caveat: I may be wrong about this.  Anyone on the Pine Team care to
        comment?

Cheers,

Some mysterious combination of keys causes white screen w/black type to 
switch to black screen w/white type.  Problem seems associated w/users 
who have Windows 95 and use HyperTerminal to access Pine.  My server is 
Tenet, and their helpdesk people haven't been able to solve the mystery.  
Does anyone else have this problem, and/or know how to reverse it?  
thanks.  I am a novice, so any replies should be in KISS (keep it simple 
for stupids).

A couple people sent me mail suggesting vim, which has a built-in
paragraph-justify thing.  I'll try it but I'm wondering how GUI
the Windows 3.x and 95 versions are - can you cut and paste and
use the scroll bar?  Also, what I really want is something that
has all the above features that normal people (non-vi people)
can use.  I help a lot of people with Net stuff and I need to
find a good text editor to recommend to them that *I CAN ALSO
USE* (that's why the vi emulation would be nice).  Right now
I set people up with pico but then when I try to do something
for them,  I usually create a mess because I start typing 
things like `ESCAPE jjj' to move around.

Thanks,
Nancy

PS - Where can I get the Win 3.1 and Win 95 versions of vim?

The problem is on machine (a), the client.

The problem is that a malloc() call failed.

Were you trying to send something particularly large in the message?

In order to print out a copy of a message I am sending
someone from Pine I have been in the habit of sending myself
a copy & then printing it out. Is there some way I can print
out a message before I send it off?

TIA,

No problem. Just edit a file called .signature in your root directory.

	Got to be careful.....maybe they read the help in setup/config

	This "ugly" but should work.

1.	When you are finished composing, use ctrl-O to Postpone.
2.	Change to the postpone folder.
3.	V(iew) the message you want to print.
4.	Y(int) the message.

	You can they type c(ompose) to resume and then (of course)
ctrl-x to send.....

There are programs out there that work on unix systems.  Digital Unix
comes with a program called "vacation" (I don't know how "generic" it
is) that will automatically reply to a message.  Pine itself does not
have that function, and can't since, to my knowledge, pine is not
programmed to run as a daemon.

I know this doesn't have anything to do with Pine, but since the question
of a vacation program seems quite frequent on this list (I've seen it four
times in two weeks) can someone tell me where a Vacation program could be
FTPed from? Thanks.

You can use fetchmail or getmail, then use Pine to read you local mail.

Roland,

   You need to set up the environment variable HOME or PINEHOME to point to
where you want your mail folders created (I don't think they have to point
at the PINE directory.

	You do one of two things:

1.	Delete files in the area noted as being over quota.

2.	Ask your sys admin to increase your quota.

Hi,

Is there any way to make Pine automatically
highlight (or somehow mark) folders with
unanswered messages inside? In this way
I could tell at a glance (from the folder
list) where are the messages I have not
yet answered, instead of having to read
the contents of each folder...

I'm using v. 3.95.

Thanks for any help!

In the setup/config go to the feature list and enable background 
sending. From the pine Help:

        FEATURE: enable-background-sending
 
This feature affects the behavior of Pine's mail sending.  If set, this
feature enables a subcommand in the composer's "Send?" confirmation
prompt.  The subcommand allows you to tell Pine to handle the actual
posting in the background.  While this feature usually allows posting
to appear to happen very fast, it has no affect on the actual delivery
time it takes a message to arrive at its destination.
 
NOTE 1: This feature isn't supported on all systems.  All DOS and Windows,
        as well as several Unix ports, do not recognize this feature.
 
NOTE 2: Error handling is significantly different when this feature is
        enabled.  Any message posting failure results in the message
        being appended to your "Interrupted" mail folder.  When you
        type the "Compose" command, Pine will notice this folder and
        offer to extract any messages contained.  Upon continuing a 
        failed message, Pine will display the nature of the failure 
        in the status message line.
 
WARNING: Under extreme conditions, it is possible for message data to
         get lost.  Do not enable this feature if you typically run close
         to any sort of disk-space limits or quotas.

Don't know if it works for linux ...

Suppose we have two logins: login "A" and login "B".
At login "A" we have created ".forward" file which will forward messages 
from "A" to "B".
When any message is mailed to "A" it forwards to "B" (well this works 
perfectly) in this process the message from "A" is deleted. Message 
appears only at "B".  We want a way through which the message also stays 
at "A" & also forwards to "B". Is there any configuration in Pine which 
we will help us to do so. Any help will be highly appreciated. Thank's in 
advance.

Does anyone do any programming modifications to the ne editor.  I need 2
major modifications:

1)  ne needs to be able to read a printer configuration file that I've
already made.
    ne would then use the printer aliases in this file to give the user
the  ability
    to choose which system printer to print to.

2)  Mail Merge capability. ne needs to accept a file as the 2nd
argument.  The first
    argument is the file to edit.  The second argument is a filename
containing a list     of name, addresses, etc.  that would be merged
into the document.  

If anyone would like some contract work please call:

There is no configuration to set here.

lockf() is not a system call.  The system calls in question are flock()
and fcntl().  flock() is the appropriate call on OSF/1.

flock() is a no-op over NFS.  This is OK, since the only locks maintained
by flock() are locks for mechanisms that can't work over NFS anyway.  No,
you do not want to do multiple simultaneous shared read/write access using
NFS.

You don't want to do fcntl() locking if you have flock().  fcntl() tries
to lock over NFS, but attemping to use this capability will cause a
cluster-wide hang.  Trust us, not the vendor; it doesn't work.  If your
vendor says it does work, get him to commit to it in writing, and commit
to giving you lots of free hardware when it fails.  ;-)

The primary lock for UNIX mbox format files is the .lock file, which does
work over NFS.

	Not a pine config....but a .forward config:

	Use:

\usernameA
usernameB@B.foo.bar

	OK?

Perhaps it might be a little less "ugly" to make sure that mail sent is
being saved to folders, and then print from those. I realize this means
that it can only be printed after sending, rather than before.

to connect before they can begin. If the connection fails the person
can't use pine at all.
   It seems that there must be a way to suppress this attempt to connect
to the Internet, but I haven't found it. Setting my mail server to
localhost looked like it ought to work, but didn't.
   What is it that pine is trying to do that makes it connect to the
Internet at startup rather than waiting for new outgoing mail to be
launched? My system pulls e-mail to it via POP3, so there is no need
for pine to be looking for new mail. 

Thanks for the help,
Bill Cripe

a) Eudora does not need powerful hardware, nor does it *have* to be
   run over a tcp/ip stack.  Eudora has, and still does, support a
   simple serial connection to a terminal server from where it can
   issue "telnet host 110" and "telnet host 25" commands to interact
   with a pop3 server and a smtp server.

b) It has been possible to use TCP/IP as a networking protocol on low end 
   processors - such as the intel 8088 and intel 8086.  I would not be
   surprised to find a tcp/ip stack for m68k Macs that have 68000
   processors, such as the Mac Plus or Mac SE (68020?).

c) Again, *free* TCP/IP stacks have been available for DOS (and perhaps
   MacOS) for a long time.

Modem speed has little to do with tcp/ip.  I was using a 2400 bps modem
for a SLIP link in 1988.  I believe I used POPmail/PC (from the Univ.
of Minnesota) as pop3 client at that time.

I appreciate that you like a Unix curses interface to your mail and
HTML.  I also happen to like the same.  I did however wish to point out
that even fairly low-end platforms can use tcp/ip as a networking
protocol.

I wish to post to a large list of newsgroups on Pine 3.91.  However, when

HOW DO I DO IT?

Hello-

We have been having difficulty debugging a problem with
our pine server running imapd.  The server keeps rejecting
requests or attempts by the PCpine client program to 
retrieve mail.  Pop clients appear to have no problems.
Where can I look to find a detailed description of the 
imapd setup and configuration for Pine running under Linux.

Thanks-

These are created when Pine makes an unsuccessful attempt to re-write
the .pinerc file.  Pine is able to create a temp file, but then cannot
write to it.  This is typically caused by a disk full or over-quota
condition...

Are your folders in your home directory on host2?  If not, you need to
specify the path (either absolute or relative to your home directory)
between "{host2}" and "[]".  For details, see

What is the exact error message?

"g {host2}" is equivalent to "g {host2}INBOX" which has special rules
for determining its location.  All other folders are relative to your
home directory.

Why not allow yourself to go "wild" and *try* it?

If you did try it....and had trouble of some kind....then tell us

Are you sure it is Pine 3.5?  The current version is 3.95.

 
> Is the IMAP server in the Pine distribution a full IMAP implementation?

I simply got the IMAP separately from ftp.cac.washington.edu, why not?
That will be full implementation... :-)

Cheers!

Another possibility is:

 3.	Compress some of your files using, e.g., gzip.

Hello,
	We have an SCO UNIX system version 3.2r4.2 and we
are trying to get PINE to run.  The version of PINE we are
using is: v3.91

This machine is not networked and simply has dumb terminals
attached to it.  The error we keep getting after composing
and trying to send a message is:

	No Valid Author Specified.  

The email does not go through although a copy is saved in 
the user's saved mail folder.  This happens whether it's
the superuser (root) or any other normal system user.

Does anyone know what this problem might be?

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Please post/email
replies ASAP.		-Deepak	<deepak@pcsltd.com>

Good people,
Using Pine to subscribe to newsgroups always yields the following:

      502 You have no permission to speak.  Goodbye

This condition seemed to just start out of the blue. One day it worked,
the next day it didn't. The SA here says he doesn't know why, but
thought a version upgrade of Pine might help, which it did not.
The current version is 3.95
nntp-server = news.tlg.org

Does anyone have a clue what is amiss here?

thanks,
Mark Olson

We installed pine using imap4, and {sever}/var/spool/mail on SunOS4.1.x. 
It works ok except it periodically gets hung, for example, when first started 
and when sending an email message. I determined it is not a network 
related problem. "trace -p <pid-of-pine>" shows the following repeated
system calls. Any help is appreciated. Thanks.

	Sounds like the NNTP server you are try to talk to refuses
to speak to you.  This is generally a configuration on the server
side.  By any chance did you change the settings of your pinerc
file to point to a different NNTP than you normally connect with?

Addresbook is just a regular text file (if you haven't changed anything, it is
called .addressbook) with simple structure. You can load it in any text editor
(like pico or emacs) and edit it as you see fit, as long as the structure of
entries is preserved. Hope this helps a bit.

No, it was a small message.  I think there was a general problem
on the system (machine a) because after I crashed out of pine,
and posted my msg about it, I got an error message when I tried
to just do a `w' to see who was on the system.

Thanks,
Nancy

PS - Is it possible for future versions of pine to give error
messages that tell which host the problem is on?  If IMAP
becomes popular (which I hope it does!), it will probably be
common for people to have scenarios like I described with 
machines a, b, c, and d being used for all different aspects
of a pine event.

I am running Pine 3.91 on SCO 3.2. I have installed pine and am having one
major problem: No messages are being expunged from any folder. I cleared it
down manually, sent myself three messages and tried to expunge the first. I
discovered 4 messages. The third message had become corrupted.  A zero value
From: To: had been inserted between the ^A^A^A^A^A's. 

This is driving me nuts. I cannot recompile as I don't have the relevant 
tcp/ip development kit. However, I have an identical(? - it is supposed 
to be) machine upon which Pine works fine.

I have looked at the debug (-d99) files and there is a message:

IMAP 17:20 1/9 mm_log babble: Find of mailbox outside context: /root/.pine-intr

Does this ring any bell with anyone? What is, and where can I find the 
file mentioned above, or is it destroyed upon exit from Pine?

Any ideas would be gratefully received.

I am using MMDF/UUCP as the MTA.

Help!
Nick

The *OLD* Mac version of Eudora, when it was still a product from the
University of Illinois (i.e Eudora 1.3 and earlier) supported direct
use of the communication toolbox and worked directly over a modem.
I've been using (and writing) communication and tcp/ip software for
PCs for over a decade, and perhaps, just perhaps, I might know what I am
talking about!

Who says you need to use Eudora to access mail via tcp/ip under DOS or
MacOS.  Check NuPOP (ftp://ftp.acns.nwu.edu) or POPmail/Mac and POPmail/PC
- both of which were also free (available from boombox.micro.umn.edu).

Grep through the helpfile/credits of the Trumpet Winsock for
"Ashok Aiyar" sometime.  Or write Pete and ask him what he thinks of me.

Here are at least three free TCP/IP stacks for PCs.
a) KA9Q - free for academics and hams
b) NCSA's stack (used in both the NCSA and CUTCP packages)
c) WATTCP

Why are are you stuck on using Windows for internet access?  As I said,
I have been using TCP/IP since the late '80s - long before Winsock 1.1
was available as a spec.  2400 bps *was* fast then - and it did work
adequately for POPmail/PC and NuPOP!

Incidentally, NuPOP akin to Eudora did not need to run over TCP/IP.

I do.  Make sure you *know* what you are talking about - before you do.

Last time I looked NuPOP was still freeware.

Ahem .... do you know who wrote the first http server that ran over
KA9Q, the predominant TCP/IP package used on the "worldwide tcp/ip
radioamateur network" - to use your term?  I also wrote parts of a
gopher server for KA9Q, and re-wrote portions of the KA9Q smtp, pop2,
pop3 and ftp servers.

Subject: features for I18N: TM style charset definition

Message-ID: <5b0v0v$9qc@net161-61.student.yale.edu>
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=euc-kr
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

  TM(Tools for MIME) quite widely used by Emacs mania 
have a couple of very useful features mising in Pine.
Not being an Emacs fan, I don't wanna learn Emacs 
to make use of them available in TM. I'd rather see
them implemented in a future version of Pine, my
favorite and (really superb) mail client.  

  Enclosed below is a little bit cryptic(I hope not)
description of features  I'd like Pine developers pay attention
to and implement in next release. In case more elaboration
is necessary, I'll back up later.

------------
  Follow the model of TM(Tool for MIME)

Allows users to define a list of 4-field record for each
charset.

  1. charset name for body
    
     e.g. ISO-8859-1, US-ASCII, EUC-KR, EUC-JP, ISO-8859-7
          KOI-8, etc

      Due to a little bit peculiar char. of Korean mail,
      if charset for body is EUC-KR and available transmission
      level is 7bit(required transmission level for EUC-KR 
      is 8bit), charset name to be put 	in the 'charset' field
      of 'Content-Type: ' header is not EUC-KR but ISO-2022-KR
      and body should be encoded into 7bit ISO-2022-KR.
      Thus, a special treatment harmless to all other cases
      is needed.
      
     

  2. optional charset name for header
     if not defined, use the value of the 1st field.

     This option is useful for following two cases. One is
     when different charsets are used in body and header
     (Japanese body and French Subject) as mentioned
     in documents for sendmail 8.8.x by the author of
     sendmail. The other is RFC 1557 conformant
     Korean message which requires ISO-2022-KR body
     and B/Q encoded EUC-KR header.

  
  3. required transmission level for the charset
     specified in 1. 
      : 8bit, binary, 7bit

   e.g. US-ASCII has required transmission level 7bit
       while most others have 8bit(e.g. ISO-8859-X
       and EUC-{CN,JP,KR}, KOI-8)


  4. whether or not to enforce encoding
     regardless of ESMTP neogotiation result
     if not defined, do not enforce, but follow the
     result of ESMTP negotiation.
     This is useful when using MTAs which are 
     8bit clean , but are not RFC 1651/1642-compliant.
     (e.g. sendmail 8.6.x)

  5. encoding method to use : base64/qp, 7bit
     when required transmission
     level is higher than one available  according
     to the result of ESMTP negotiation

     Default: 7bit for CJK(Chinese,Japanese,Korean
     Refer to RFC 1922,1468 and 1557, respectively)
     and base64/qp for all others.

  6. encoding filter command to use 
     when encoding scheme designated in 5 is not
     supported internally.
     Ignored if specified for base64/qp and other
     internally supported encoding method in 5.

     For instance, 7bit encoding for EUC-KR(Korean)
     charset needs "EUC-KR to ISO-2022-KR" filter
     which may or may not be supported internally
     by a future version of Pine. If not, users
     can specify their own filters. The same is
     true of ISO-2022-JP and ISO-2022-CN. 

Example of pinerc entries are 

mime_charset_definition={us-ascii/us-ascii/7bit///},
       {iso-8859-1/iso-8859-1/8bit/no/qp/},
       {iso-8859-5/iso-8859-5/8bit/no/base64/},
       {hz/hz/7bit/no//},# HZ; 7bit Chinese charset used in alt.talk.chinese.hz
       {euc-kr/euc-kr/8bit/no/7bit/hmconv},
       {iso-2022-jp/iso-2022-jp/7bit/no//} 

  where 'hmconv' is a converter between EUC-KR and ISO-2022-KR.


In composition session,  allows users to interactively change charset
for body thus making switching between one lang/charset and another much
easier and faster than now. Of course,there should be a way to set
default body charset as is currenly the case, so that most users who
never send messages in more than one charset/lang. don't have to bother
with charset setting. Also, let users override default  charset for
headers determined from the value of hdr charset field(item 2) in the
above list corresponding to the body charset specified in composition
session. Need for this arises because charset in header is not
necessarily charset used for body(i.e.  one can send a message with
Korean body and German Subject)

   I wish this proposal would be carefully considered by Pine
development team and would make itself into next release of Pine.

Hi, 

David Miller helped me out with my question and I thought I would post
this summary of his response.

I wanted to access mail from two different accounts on two different IMAP
servers (didn't want forwarding
from one account to another) and wasn't sure how to set
up my folders. David Miller explains:
(incoming-folders is an option you enable by X'ing the
enable-incoming-folders option)
Hope it helps someone else,
Thanks,
Kiran.
############David's response:############################
Your INBOX and other folders are usually in completely different
directories.  Usually, your primary folder collection is in your home
directory and only your INBOX is in var/spool/mail.  Here is an
example Pine configuration that might help:

	inbox-path={host1}INBOX			# INBOX on host1

	incoming-folders="Host2 INBOX" {host2}INBOX	
						# INBOX on host2

	folder-collections="Folders on Host1" {host1}mail/[],
						# Primary Folder
						# Collection
			"Folders on Host2" {host2}mail/[]
						# alternate folder
						# collection

If your IMAP servers are properly configured, they should know where
your INBOX is located, so you don't need to specify the path and
filename. 

Does that help?

Is that a question?  ;-)

Sure, you just keep in mind which lines were cut up and fix them.
Somehow I don't think this is ll become a favourite feature of PICO.

Maybe the kitchen-sink people have done that?
Naah - they already have turned their editor into a newsreader.

Subject: How to cc: to myself automatically

Hi,

	We are using Pine 3.93 on an Unix box running Solaris 2.5.

	When the users use pine, some of them want to implement the feature

	to cc: to themselves automatically. I read the FAQ and don't seem

	to find it. Is it possible for the user to do it or the system

	administrator has to do it?

Thanks,

Sankar

The following are the two lines in your .pinerc file located in your root
directory.  The first is a remark, the second line should be changed to
what you see below - the 99.9 after the = sign.  That will keep it from
asking you at the beginning of each new month. 

# Set by Pine; controls beginning-of-month sent-mail pruning.
last-time-prune-questioned=99.9

If you want to keep a copy of mail you send then the best way of doing so
is _not_ by Cc'ing it to yourself.  (This would pass it to the mail
system, which would then send it back to your INBOX.)

Instead you want to use "Fcc" (File Carbon Copy).  This is a header field
akin to "To:", "Cc:", etc but which takes the name of one of your folders
instead of an e-mail address.

You can get to (and set/change) the Fcc header value when composing a
message by putting your cursor on a header line and then typing ^R (Rich
Headers).  Then put the cursor on the now-revealed Fcc line and ask Pine
for help (by typing ^G).

If you want to have this set to a folder by default (eg, "sent-mail") then
go to Pine's Setup Configuration screen (S then C at its Main Menu) and
look through the options for "default-fcc".  Read its help text for more
information.

By setting default-fcc the Fcc header will be set to this value by default
for every message you send (except when overridden by an Fcc value for an
Address Book entry).  If you _don't_ want to store a copy of the message
you're sending (perhaps it has a large file attached to it) then use the
^R (Rich Headers) command to see all the headers of the message you're
composing and then delete the Fcc header line's value.

Cheers,

  While I don't think that RFC 1036 (Usenet) mentions anything about
  header line length, RFC 821 (SMTP) limits all lines of a mail message
  to 1000 characters, including the carriage return/line-feed.  It would
  be prudent to adhere to the RFC 821 and RFC 822 standards as news
  messages are often gatewayed to mailing lists or forwarded as mail.
  In fact, RFC 1036 is explicit in this regard with RFC 822.

Is there any way to configure PINE such that when messages are exported,
any associated attachments are automatically converted to a uue(?) format
and stay with the export file?

I get a lot of mail which currently I only have time every day to export
to a digest, delete, and read off-line. Problem is that attachments are
lost.

Alternatively is there some way of configuring PINE to indicate which
posts have attachments on the index listing?

Many thanks
Paul Lunney

Colleagues,

I am representing the Federal World Wide Web Consortium.  This is the first
message to Federal Webmasters since we have re-established this list.  You all
attended one or both of our Federal Webmasters Workshops, and so we assume
you'll be interested in the occasional announcement related to the topics of
the Web, and Federal information services.  If you'd rather not be on the list,
please reply to me directly (lbrandt@nsf.gov) and we'll remove you from the
list, or if you have someone who should be on the list, please send us their
name and email address.

If you have such a message you wish to be sent to federal webmasters, please
send it to me, and if it is well-targeted for the list, we'll pass it on.

Below is the announcement of a call for white papers in the area of Federal
information services.  Please read it through and pass on to colleagues. We'd
very much like your ideas and comments.

Thanks.

------------------------------
A  workshop on R&D Opportunities in Federal Information Services is being
sponsored by the Applications Council of the National Science and
Technology Council's Committee on Computing, Information, and
Communications and is being coordinated by the Information Sciences
Institute of the University of Southern California. Funding for conducting
the workshop has been provided by the National Science Foundation's
Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering, the
President's Government Information Technology Services Board, and National
Institutes of Health's National Center for Research Resources. The workshop
is scheduled for May 13-15, 1997 to be held at a location to be determined
in or near Washington, D.C.

The workshop is intended to address a concern regarding high level
disconnect of the information services (IS) field from the information
technologies R&D world, a disconnect which is cultural, educational and
technological. This gap between the industrial IS segment and the R&D
performers in the information technologies (IT) sector, is of some concern
to vendors, users and R&D performers and government supporters of R&D in
information technologies.

As a result of the first meeting (December 3-4) of the organizing committee
for the workshop, a Call for White Papers has been developed.  The Call and
additional information on the workshop process can be found at URL
http://www.isi.edu/nsf/ .  This URL will be kept live and dynamic as more
information is available, and will serve as the entry point for on-line
submission of White Papers beginning in mid-January 1997.  Papers are due
no later than March 3, 1997.

All sectors and interested parties are encouraged to submit Papers for
review.  Please forward this message to any interested individuals or
organizations.

Thank you.

I'm running NCSA Telnet 2.6 on a Mac. When editing pine messages or pico
files, hitting return seems to be interpreted as a "justify" command. 

I've tried switching the session configuration to Berkeley BSD mode and
tried changing my terminal emulation from VT200 to VT100. I also tried
changing my "translation" from "none" to US ASCII to no avail. None of
these strategies seem to solve the problem. 

Any suggestions would be appreciated. Otherwise I'm stuck with "vi" - not
my favorite editor to teach novice users.

I am currently using PINE 3.94 on a Sun Sparc 1000E using Solaris
2.5.1.  I would like to send mail to a specific user, attaching
a file as well.  However, I want to do this non-interactively, that
is, on a command line, I want to specify the address to email to,
the file to attach and so on.

In standard UNIX mail, I can do the following:

	mail -s "Subject goes here"  joe@somewhere < SendThisFile.

But what I want is to do something like:

	pine -s "Subject goes here" -a "Attach this file" < joe@somewhere


Can this be done?  Any help would be appreciated.

Afternoon,

	I installed pine3.95 on an SCO 3.2v4.0 system today and ran into a
problem.  Pine is not finding the incoming mail folder.  If I run pine3.91
everything is fine.  I check back on my system an SCO 3.2v5.0 system where
I recently did this and as far as I can tell, everything is the same.  Any
ideas?

Thx,

One thing to watch out for is that if you then edit the address book from
within pine it will re-sort when you change something. So, you should go
to the config screen and look for the variable "addrbook-sort-rule" and
set it to "dont-sort" before you do this. There also isn't much support
for dealing with this problem from within pine. If you add a new entry to
an unsorted address book it isn't possible to control where it gets added.

If you do want to do it with cc instead of fcc (I can think of some
reasons to do it that way) then you can use the customized-hdrs variable
in the Config screen to set up a cc or bcc header.

Under Unix, I generally just make symlinks in this case;  it's not real
elegant, but it's highly effective and quick.

For those who don't already know this, an example:  my friend Fred Smith
has two email addresses, fred@home.net and smith@work.com.  I have a folder
called "smith" with email from the latter, and I start getting things from
fred@home.net.

~ % cd mail
~/mail % ln -s smith fred

Now, fred is a symlink to "smith", and if I just go ahead and save to
either, all mail will wind up in "smith".  Pine never knows the difference.

I have a long list and wish to copy it from my word perfect.  Each board 
is separated by a comma and I am using the "cut" and "paste" which has 
the lines automatically wrap.   I am trying to sell something and that is 
the reason for the multiple boards.

The problem is that because of the size of the list, it fills up the 
Newsgroup: section and then carries on into the summary and the keyword 
sections.

Any suggestions?  Thanks.  RJ

Question: When I save a message, it is saved and deleted.  But when I
forward a message it is not.  Can this be changed, ie, I want to
automatically delete the message when it is forwarded.

I don't subscribe to the newsgroup so please respond to me personally.
thanks

Depending on which formats you are converting, Pine itself should be
able to do the conversion.  On DOS/Windows, if you are going from
bezerk to MTX format, you could set up a special PINERC file with an
initial-keystrokes list that selects all messages in a folder and
copies them to a new folder.  You might wrap that in a BAT file that
changes filenames, etc...

> Does it do conversions in either direction? 

If you have a folder in the desired format, e.g. with a dummy message
in it, Pine will add new messages in that format.  This is the same
with both Unix and PC Pines; PC-Pine's selection of formats is just
more limited...

Change to the imap directory, then download, uncompress, and untar 

	ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap-utils.tar.Z

Then
	make xxx	# "xxx" is your platform
	cd mbxcvt

I understand how to use a .forward file.  Is there any way to program a
unix/pine account so that it will forward copies of the mail -- so that
when I return, the mail will still be there in my account?  I will be
moving between accounts a lot for the next two months, and would like to
have my New York mail available to me at both sites.  (Yes, I know about
telnetting, but it's frightfully slow between these two servers.) 

All suggestions appreciated,

Michael

Try ftp://ftp.qualcomm.com/quest/eudora/mac/1.3 - it has all the
software that you need to use Eudora over a serial connection, or MacTCP
or a UUCP transport.  

You can also get a copy of the Eudora 1.3 source from the same directory.  
There are many differences between Eudora and Pine; minimally:
a) off-line pop3 operation
b) support for binhex encoding
c) a gui interface that supports the use of a mouse

The rest of your post is tripe, and it would be an exercise in
futility to address it.

We are anxious for IMAP4 that is planned to be in Pine 4.0.  Are there any
estimates when Pine 4.0 will be available?

Thank Ashok very much.
Without you, we are lost!

At this point, I don't think it is worthwhile to waste other time with
you.
So, I'll not reply more.
 

-------------------------------

Rest of the world.

This matter starts to be interesting!
I wanna put order.

Istead of trying 'the *OLD* Mac version of Eudora' 1.3, as Ashok
suggest, I'm going to try Eudora 1.5.
A friend of mine, that didn't write anything of the KA9Q stuff but that
is able to read, noticed something that sounds interesting.
In the QUALCOMM web site he noticed, as I did, that "Direct Serial
Dialup" and "Integrated TCP/IP, SLIP and PPP software" are not supported
in Eudora 1.1 and Eudora 1.4 (both PC version), but only in the
commercial version.
Now, in the same site it also written that "Integrated TCP/IP, SLIP and
PPP software" is  not supported in Eudora 1.3.1 and Eudora 1.5 (both MAC
version), but only in the commercial version.
In this case, nothing is said about "Direct Serial Dialup"!! It is not
considered an enhancement to 1.3.1. 

In his opinion, that at this point is also mine, not only 'the *OLD* Mac
version of Eudora' 1.3 is able to send and receive mail remotely, via
modem, without a SLIP or PPP connection, but probably also Eudora 1.5!

( Ashok, did you check QUALCOMM site, right?  )
( Oh sorry, I'm forgetting you dont' have to, you know! )

So, do you have an old PC/MAC and old modem?
You don't want to replace them, neither pay a service provider just to
check your E-mail.
You do not have TCP/IP stack and you do not want to buy one.
Do you have a free telnet Unix account from an Educational istitution?
This is for you.


The choices appear to be:

OLD MAC: Eudora 1.3 vs VT100(PINE/Unix).

OLD PC : VT100(PINE/Unix) vs NuPOP vs PC-PINE(DOS/WATTCP).

Of course, I'm taking VT100 as popular but other choices are welcome.
Of course, I'm taking PINE/Unix because we are in the PINE NEWSGROUP!

 (just to prevent a lot of replies saying I misinform !)

ON the MAC side there is a good reason to suppose that also Eudora 1.5
can be used.

On the PC side there is a suggestion about NuPOP. Anybody tried it?
The suggestion about using a free TCP/IP stack and then choosing, for
instance, PC-PINE (because we are in the PINE Newsgroup!) appears not
practical, 
especially if you do not know what a Gigabit is!

http://www.rtd.com/pcnfsfaq/SecA.html#A-3a 
reports a good list of TCP/IP stacks.
As you can see TCP/IP, NORMALLY, is not free, neither cheap. Anyway,
KA9Q and Waterloo (WATTCP) seem free. But they are not "plug and play".
The popular Waterloo TCP, for instance, is devoted to developers and
needs to be compiled.
Just to check E-mail, it appears too much. 

ftp://ftp.cac.psu.edu/pub/dos/info/ibmpc-tcpip.FAQ 
reports (A-5):
"KA9Q supports SLIP/CSLIP/PPP, but unfortunately can not be used as a
TCP/IP protocol stack to run other apps."
Ashok Aiyar, one of the developer of KA9Q stuff, didn't help so much to
put clearness on this topic, as you can see! ("Re: PINE vs EUDORA! I
still love my tripe!" in this Newsgroup)

Other TCP/IP packages can be found in:
ftp://ftp.cac.psu.edu/pub/dos/info/tcpip.packages

Other aspects have to be considered:
If you succeed to run WATTCP for instance, you can also navigate with
graphic (SPIN) or without (DOSLYNX) in case you have a low bps modem.

Did you succeed? Wait a  moment.If your Unix account provide just a
simple telnet session you need also SLIP/PPP support. Ther is a
suggestion about SLiRP. It doesn't appear so difficult. There is
precompiled stuff!

But also accessing as a simple VT100 terminal it is enough to navigate
(LYNX) without graphic.

What is the best?

Do you suggest something?
Much better, did you try something?

I tried VT100(PINE/Unix) on MAC. See "PINE vs EUDORA" in this Newsgroup.
It looks good and very easy to install!

Try hitting the H key when you are viewing the message.  You may have to
go to the pine configuration screen and select enable-full-header-cmd as
an option.

Richard,
Exactly *which* IMAP4 features are you anxious for?

(The only user-visible one planned for Pine 4.00 is folder hierarchy
support.)

I have also had the same problem from time to time, and here's how
I've learned to fix it:

at the prompt, type:  
		mv ~/../mail/{YOUR LOGIN ID HERE}  ~/mail/oldINBOX
		pico ~/mail/oldINBOX

When you run pico, it'll say something like "Long Lines Wrapped", but
there won't be anything on the screen.  Press either Ctrl-6 or Ctrl-^
to set a mark.  The screen should say "Mark Set".  Then use Ctrl-V to
page down until you get to the first complete message, which starts
with "From:". Position the cursor one line above the "From" line, and
use Ctrl-K to delete everything above.  Exit and Save.  Start Pine.
It'll say there's no inbox.  Open the oldINBOX folder, and there's
your mail - all except the first message which got corrupted.  Pine
will create a  new inbox the next time there's mail in it.

It's definitely a pain!

I'm using pine version 3.93. 

I would like to change the 'default' permission of the #pico?????# file.
The permission for the dead.letter is fine but I don't like that the 
#pico?????# file is readable by everybody. 

-rw-------   1 susanne  phd         1419 Jan  9 13:32 dead.letter
-rw-r--r--   1 susanne  phd         6031 Jan  9 13:28 #pico11763#

As the file is automatically created and the ????? changes depending on 
the process number of pine, I don't have any idea how to change the 
permission. 

Thanks a lot, 

           Susanne

The best way to surpess this action is by deleting your PINE binary.

Upon sending, PINE calls sendmail to process a message.  Your system
should contain a file /etc/sendmail.cf indicating which host is the
SMTP gateway.  When PINE passes it an outgoing message, sendmail will
forward that message to the SMTP gateway by initiating a TCP connection.
If your gateway is set to localhost, then sendmail will establish
a direct connection with the recipient's mail server. In order to 
establish a TCP connection, you need to establish a link to the Internet.

If you want Internet mail capabilities, your system needs a connection
to the Internet.

Hope this helps.

Krista:

It appears that the file was saved in your home directory, which PINE uses
by default for saves unless you tell it differently when actually saving
the file.  If you didn't tell it differently, here's how you can see it
and view it:

If you haven't exited PINE yet, do so.  Then at your command prompt (which
probably looks like a "%" sign or something similar, type "ls -la", and
hit enter. This will list the entire contents of your home directory. 
Your file *should* be there.  Assuming it's text you can type "pico (name
of file)" and that will let you see the text attachment.  If it's a
binary, like a word processing file or a spreadsheet file, you will most
likely need to FTP it out of your home directory onto your work station or
PC. If this is the case contact your system administrator at your school,
and he or she can advise you on the best way to accomplish this.  Let me
know if this helps.

Good luck,

I was in similar situation: lost connection due to PPP/Phone problems in 
the middle of composing a new email.  Pine was on an SGI (Irix 5.3, Pine 
3.95).

When I reconnect and started composing new message in Pine, I got a prompt 
to recover from a crash.  I said yes, and got in pretty much where I left.  
So, it was a good experience.  I know my Pine was compiled with all the 
options in default values.  If yours is different, the behavior may be 
different.

  When you're composing the note, put all those addresses in the BCC field
in the header. If the BCC field isn't already-visible on the top of the
screen, then move the cursor up there and press Control-R. This should
bring up the BCC field along with other ones.
  Fill in the BCC field with those addresses and that's it.

  Hope this helps.

	Sounds like you need to learn some rules of communications.
It sense that you are dialing long distance to your old ISP.  The
chaces are more than good that noise is being picked up and creating
these false characters for you.  You need to learn how to turn on
error correction in your modem and (if required) your communications
SW.  It may be helpful to contact the helpdesk of your old ISP.

	Regards,

	Hummm....selling something????

	Anyway, the problem is that you cut and paste is putting in
the cr for you.  So, solve that problem and you have a fix.

I found that PINE will NOT read message in the form of the new NutScrape
bug by selecting 'v', but if you must, you CAN read the message if you
reply, oddly enough. 

Take care,

Don't let Robert J. Wilshe scare you off;-) Type ftp, open <hostname> (e.g. 
ftp.your-uni.edu), change (cd) to export/home/qlink/6klp2/, type ls (or dir) 
to locate the file, type get <filename> and there you are.

Just my $.02.

  There are Free-Nets in California. For a list of them, visit:

http://www.scn.org/other.freenets.html

  These Free-Nets are typically terminal-based, meaning that you can
connect to them from a DOS machine with a terminal program (e.g. Telix
for DOS).

  Hope this helps.

Message-ID: <5b83fg$1t9u@navajo.gate.net>

  Having been innundated by HTML emails from early adopters of Netscape's
new version (a problem that's only going to get worse), I decided to fix
it.  So I poured over man pages, edited mailcaps, and generally killed ten
minutes.  Held my breath, launched pine, and...

  [Part 1, Text/PLAIN  35 lines]
  [Not Shown. Use the "V" command to view or save this part]

  [Part 2, ""  Text/HTML  39 lines]
  [Not Shown. Use the "V" command to view or save this part]

Hmm.  So now that I've succeeded in telling pine that it can't handle 
Text/HTML, how do I tell it that it *can* handle Text/PLAIN?

Hallow, my name is Adam Matsuba and I'm sending you this message because I
need an professional's opinion on my Mac Plus.

	I have a Macintosh Plus 1MB, and a Macintosh Performa 5260.  The Macintosh
Plus does not have an HD, and also is low on RAM.  I want to get the RAM
upgraded to 4MB's so I can run the minimized version of Mac System 7.0 or
7.1, and if possible 7.3 and up.  Also I want to get a reasonable 80MB or
120MB HD for it, I want it external.  And in the future, I want to set the
Mac Plus as a Mail and FAX receiver. Also I want to connect it to my
Performa
with LocalTalk, and set up a Dial-up net server so I can access my Mac's
from School.  
	But I want to get the RAM and HD for under $250.00, so what do you think,
is it possible and do you Have any Ideas, any please, I love my Mac Plus
and
I don't want it in the trash.

	My e-mail address is: his888@po.cisnet.or.jp  and my name is Adam Matsuba.

	Thank you

Well, write a mail with caps lock on to as many people as possible, that
should do the trick.

Otherwise check 
ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de    for
pub/packages/procmail/procmail.tar.gz.

Or get another filter. There is a nice filtering faq at www.yahoo.com.
Speaking of which - doesn't it say "pine cannot filter mail" in the first line
of the pine-faq >;_>

Cheers,
Robin

Help  ???      


I've started receiving mail containing two parts.  The first part is
usually a few lines of ASCII text.  The second part is about 2.9KB
long and PINE 3.91 identifies it as application/MS-TNEF.  The only
thing I can do with the second part is save it to a file.  The headers
show that the sender is using Microsoft Mail.  I asked someone who
sent me such a message what he was doing.  She was a computer novice
and didn't know.  Several messages from her had the attachment and
several didn't.  She didn't indicate she had done anything different
when sending the mail without the attachment.

So, what is the MS-TNEF attachment?  Why is it called an application?
What causes it to be sent?  Is it necessary?  If not, how can it be
avoided?

Thanks,
Barry

hello,

I would like to know as to  how can I  mail a word perfect document using
pine so that I don't need to save the document in any format other than
wordperfect 6.0 which I am using. I would like the receiver to receive
it in the same format as I had documented it in wordperfect.(meaning I do
not want any ASCII characters to replace the bullets or any other special
symbols I use for the document).

Thanks.
..Kalpana

Kalpana:

Simple enough.  Just FTP the file into your home directory, which can be
viewed at any UNIX prompt by typing "cd ~/" then "pwd".  Once the file is
there, you can attach it when you are composing your letter.  When your
cursor is on the "Attchmnt:" field press cntl-T and this will take you to
your files in your home directory.  Select the file you want to send, and
you're set.  Make sure though that your recipient can process mime-encoded
mail, which is how pine will send it.

(Robin, if you're there, help us out with UNIX ftp.  I use a Win95 client,
and I know you're proficient with the UNIX ftp commands.  :)

Good luck and best regards,

Hi Mike... (Yeesh! first start by turning OFF CapsLock...)

From the Pine main menu, select the address book. Create an address which
lists all the users you want to send mail to, and give it a unique name.
Then when you send the message to this name Pine will fill in all the
addresses.

Hi!  I am having a problem with finding my old messages I do not know how
I could have erased them because it is still stating that I have 80
messages but only four of them our showing up on the screen.  I have tried
the command "I" in the main menu but it still only pulled up those four
messages.  Can you please explain what I have done and if I can get my old
messages back?

Thank you,

Rachel

On a Unix system, you could set an alternate editor, (vi, for example),
then when you're ready to print, invoke the alternate editor with the ^_
command, and print from there.

Ideas?  Yes... try asking in the news.software.readers newsgroup.  This
forum (comp.mail.pine newsgroup / Pine-Info mailing list) is for
discussing the mail/news program called "Pine".  It is nothing to do with
Tin, which is a quite separate program.

Cheers,

If you are anxious for _IMAP_ 4 features rather than _Pine_ 4 you could
consider picking up and compiling/installing the current Beta version of
the IMAP 4 server.  The IMAP server has always been available as a
separate kit, in addition to that bundled into the Pine distribution.  Do
note, however, that the IMAP 4 kit is currently _beta_ software (although
we are having little/no problem with it here).

Cheers,

Probably you would find your old messages which you have read previously

For emulating a threaded news index most of us just type:

	$	... Sort
	O	... by OrderedSubject

This sorts articles in the index first by Subject text and then, if
articles have equeal subjects, by Date.  This gives a pretty good
emulation of threading.

(Apologies if you already knew about this!)

Subject: Downloading folders?
Message-ID: <E3s8xx.E7H@nonexistent.com>
Date: Fri, 10 Jan 1997 08:01:08 GMT

I guess this is more of a Eudora question, but since I'm using pine, and 
am open to suggestions other than Eudora, I've decided to post here...

I have something like 25 folders in my pine directory on my UNIX 
account.  I'd like to download the mail to my computer and open up like 8 
megs on my UNIX account.  So far, all I can get Eudora Pro to do is 
download INBOX contents.  I want saved-messages, sent-mail, etc. 
downloaded to.  I want it done w/ a mail dl'ing program becuase dl'ing it 
as text means it's impossible to ever really sort through on my hard drive.

Thanks.
-Dave

This is not what happens. 
I assume that you are doing ^O to postpone, then C to carry on
composing? If so, then when it starts composing it deletes the copy in
the postponed folder.

Use the OS/2 or Windows port.
If you cant do that, postpone (^O), move to the postpone folder, and
save (S) the postponed message to a different folder (or just a second
copy in the postponed folder). Then if Pine crashes this copy is left
untouched.

Well, it does use it in some circumstances, I believe. In my view, the
DOS port(s) of Pine have become unusable, and U of W should either stop
making them, or make them work (by using extended memory).

BETA? AFAIK IMAPd 4 from UW is already released (for several month at
least).  Anyway, my copy doesn't say "beta software" any more. It is new,
revised specification of IMAP 4, which is porbably in BETA state. 

Or do I miss something?

I'm sorry, I should have been clearer...

When I first looked a few weeks back there were three relevant files in
the /imap directory at ftp.cac.washington.edu...

	imap-4.tar.Z
	imap-4.1.BETA.tar.Z
	imap.tar.Z

Pretty obviously the first was a final release on the IMAP 4 server, the
second a Beta release of the 4.1 server, and the third was a symbolic link
to the first.

In the past the imap.tar.Z file pointed to the "released" software, and
the "BETA" kit to the still day-by-day evolving version.

The situation subsequently changed to (and still is):

	imap-4.1.BETA.tar.Z
	imap.tar.Z

with the latter being a symbolic link to the former.

This would tend to imply to me that the distribution kit of the final
version of 4 is no longer being made available, and people are expected
now to download the still-Beta version of 4.1. 

Presumably you obtained the final release of 4 whilst it was still
available?

Me? Sure:-)
But why use ftp? Just send the file from home, using the method Robert
described...

Otherwise, open the ftp-client by typing ftp. You should be in your home dir.
If not, got there, typing cd.
Type put <local_path>:/<filename.extension>

ftp will copy the file to your university. There, use pine's attachment.

But maybe a word should be lost on the attachment as such. 
Kalpana, attaching a file means that it stays a binary file, but is encoded by
a tool on your system so that it can be sent by email. The addressee needs the
counterpart of that tool to decode your message and then he has the same file
again.

Hope that helps any;-)

Cheers,
Robin

Unless you've toggled delete read messages or saved them somewhere else,
you'll find them in a file called READ-MESSAGES in your folder list. You get
there by typing L in the main window.
They might have gone to another folder if you received them last year - that'd
be something like READ-MESSAGES-dec-1996 or so.

Read the faq, it'll tell you more.

Robin

Hello!

We are running several MicroVAX's, and I would like to use PINE, but the
ONLY distribution I can find only contains the source.  Do you know where
I could get a version that is pre-compiled to work with VMS v5.5?

I really need PINE, and I even have the source but we don't have a "C"
compiler here.

Any help would be GREATLY appreciated!!

Thanks.

Add your username to the remote inbox definition:

{host/user=userid}inbox

However you'll still get the delay, as it will still want your password. I
don't think there's a way to have it store your password anywhere;
(wouldn't be a safe thing to do, anyway).

Subject: print index to a file
Date: 13 Jan 1997 14:51:15 -0500
Message-ID: <rlogin.853184604@shellx>

I'd like to print the index of a pine folder to a file.
In earlier versions of pine (e.g., 3.91) I had my
printer set to:

  cat > print.tmp

and could use this to print a message to a file named
print.tmp.  This does not work in 3.95.  In 3.95 I tried 
just printing to:

  cat

And it opened it up the viewer but i couldn't save it
from there.  I did a ^Z and went out to the shell and
found the temp file with the info.  I could just copy
this to another file and I'd have it, but I'm wondering 
if there's a more direct way to do this?

The above was about Unix pine (obviously, right?) but
I'm also wondering about how to get a file that contains
the index in Windows pine.

Thanks much,
Nancy

For most purposes where one wants to reset a From, setting a Reply-To
is sufficient.  Of course there are a few cases where changing the
From line might be desirable.

	Or, since Matt is using pine3.95, you could simply go to the
m(ain) menu and type s(etup) s(ignature) which will put you into edit

I'm a user through Georgia State University in Atlanta Georgia.  I haven't
received any of my e-mails today.  I have been able to send e-mails and I
have learned via the telephone that they have been received; yet I haven't
received any of the ones people has said they have sent me today.  Can you
help me out?  Or tell me how to discover what the problem is?  

Thank you,
Joan T. Wynne (mstjtw@panther.gsu.edu)

Well, it certainly isn't a pine problem>;->

Talk to your sys-admin or ISP to check what's wrong.

http://www.amherst.edu/~atstarr/computers/vacation.html
I'll post a perl script soon to the URL above, but note:

1) You need a unix shell account.
2) Your ISP may already have vacation installed systemwide. See page above
for info on how to use vacation if it is already installed.
3) If it is not already installed, perhaps e-mail your ISP and ask if they
would consider installing it; the perl script is free! If they are
concerned about infinite mail loops:
      a) it won't send autoreplies to various addresses such as
"mailerdaemon" or "postmaster" as well as anything with a header of
"Precedence: junk" or "Precedence: bulk" as all decent mailing lists should
use.
      b) It defaults to sending only one autoreply per address per week, so
even if it autoreplies to someone running an autoreply mechanism, the loop
will be a loop of 1 or perhaps 2 if the other person's autoreply uses a
slightly different return address.
4) You have to know what you are doing to install the script on your own
account on the ISP, but I think it can be done.
5) I did not write the script; I don't do any support for any of this; just
a "public service"

Good luck!  I'll try to upload the script by Saturday. (1/11/97)

I would like to put all of my outgoing messages through a filter called
nkf to change an encoding type from EUC to JIS. How can set up the
Sending-filter in the config menu? I put "nkf" in there but it wouldn't
work.

Thanks.

The only time I've seen such a file created was when the disk filled up
today, and the file size was 8192 bytes.  The contents looked like pine
was creating a new version of .pinerc using a temporary file name.

Therefore, if you stop the disk from filling up, you'll probably stop
pine from leaving these files behind when it exits, although it may still
create them and immediately rename them to .pinerc.

Although I have 'Message-Id' in viewer-hdrs, it is still displayed as
'Message-ID' which seems wrong since other headers format to the

Frank,

Most times colleges and universities will have there own email systems
for their campus, and also have the capability to send email to the
Internet using the same facilities. She should inquire if she will be
receiving an email account, and see if she can keep the same one for
her duration at the school.

I am aware of this, but what I am saying is that Pine won't format
the 'Message-ID' header to a capitalization of my choosing like it will
with other headers. If I place 'x-MaIlEr' in viewer-hdrs it will display
as 'x-MaIlEr' even if it was received as 'X-Mailer' or 'X-mailer'.

I've just switched from elm to pine, and I have some problems. Is
there some way to make pine automatically delete a folder when I have
deleted all the messages in it?

	Sounds like a cosmetic nit which doesn't have much to do with
the functionality of pine.

Yup, that's one of PICO's MISfeatures.
See my page http://www.math.fu-berlin.de/~guckes/pico/

There's nothing you can do about that.  Line length is limited with PICO.
The only solutions are either use another editor (emacs, vi, you name it) or
using a newsreader that does not have header editing (bah!).

Pine does not have a built-in editor - it uses pico.
Changing PINE will have no effect - it's the editor you must change!

Nothing (I think). => Any length should be allowed.

My suggestion is to trash PICO and use a good[tm] editor - VIM, eg:
[*]  VIM does text wrapping - simple "set tw=79" in your vimrc.
My vimrc should get you started fast:

  Is there anyway to authenticate imap login using ssh instead of
rsh? My school computer doesn't allow rsh although it 
allows 'ssh'(secure shell). I tried using port remapping(?
or is it redirection?) feature of ssh, but it doesn't work. 
TIA for any help.

I made a little comparison between a few text editors
I had around. It's kind of old, but it may be of use.
I'm not a professional reviewer or anything, but I
like fiddling with software, and I had some time on
my hands...

There are notable exceptions, like vi (which I didn't
have handy, and which I never could really learn), and
Emacs (which can probably do _anything_, the tradeoff
being its large footprint and steep learning curve).

I apologize if there are any mistakes!!!

BTW, I use NotGNU. Any bias is solely my subconscious'
fault (^-^).

First, I got mbxcvt to compile thanks to David's instructions and
some help from Audin at Halcyon.  mbxcvt does what I need (yay!) and
I wanted to share some things I've learned about converting.  Here
are three ways to do the conversion:

1) Use mbxcvt on the Unix system to convert the folder before downloading.

2) Use Windows Pine to open the Unix folder (via IMAP) and then select all
   and apply save (;aas) and save to a folder on your desktop machine.

   DISADVANTAGE: I've had a lot of IMAP connections break in the midst
   of this type of download and then I only get part of the folder
   downloaded.

3) Download the Unix folder and then open it up in Windows Pine.  It will
   be READONLY which you can fix by selecting all and saving to another
   folder (;aas again).

   BIG DISADVANTAGE: You lose status info, e.g., which messages you've
   answered.  This is unacceptable to me.
 
   QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS METHOD:  
    Is there any way to preserve the status info?
    Does the CRLF conversion happen when you do the ;aas thing?
    Why does it show up as READONLY any way??
  

QUESTIONS: Are there other methods for converting between Unix and Windows
folders?  Is there an mbxcvt that will work on DOS/Windows - that would be
great!  Is there some documentation about mbxcvt, e.g., one of my accounts
is on a VMS system and it has really weird looking folders.  So far the
only way I can get my folders over there is using method 1.

Thanks for any info about all this,
Nancy

I'm not familiar with how ssh works, but I presume it can be used in a
manner similar to rsh?  That is, you can give a command of the form:

	ssh hostname command

If this is so then you can probably get a pre-authenticated session to
start by changing the C-client library used by Pine and the imapd.

Specifically,

1.  Determine the full path name of the ssh command (eg, "which ssh"
    should tell you)

2.  Edit the RSHPATH variable for your platform in the Makefile in the
    c-client source code directory to contain the full path name of your
    ssh program instead of that of rsh.

3.  Recompile, install the executables and test.

Disclaimer: it *might* work; I'm not familiar with ssh or the mechanism
imapd uses to determine the username validated by the rshd and hence
whether this will also work with the ssh daemon.

Cheers,

Robin, when you'll install PINE with the POP3 feature everytime PINE
starts it will ask you for the username (You can preload a default one)
and a password (You can't). This is a little bit boring. 
I get access to my Unix server by phone with a MAC. Connecting in VT100
i have instructed my MAC VT 100 teminal emulation program to put
username and password automatically. (See the New : PINE vs EUDORA)
Another possibility, but i have not tried yet, is to exploit the
possibility of PINE to record and play when it starts, a sequence of
keystrokes.

Not quite: the minimal solution to avoid the long delay due to the "remote
rsh timeout" is to add the port number to the end of the hostname:

	{host.site.domain:143}inbox

This will then prompt you to supply your username and password as usual,
but without the long delay.  This is because by supplying a port number
you are telling Pine (actually the underlying C-client library) to bypass
the rsh mechanism.

If you want to avoid having to enter your username and password...

...if you are using PC-Pine then there is an option to save these.
However be warned that you should only do this if your machine is secure,
otherwise there may be a chance others can make use of the information to
your detriment.

...if you are using the UNIX version of Pine then you should ask your
Systems Administrator to consider setting up the pre-authenticated IMAP
server.  The minimal work they need to perform is simply to create a
symbolic link so that the file /etc/rimapd points to the real imapd
executable.  Each person wanting to make use of the facility will then
need to set up a ".rhosts" file to allow their imap server to accept rsh
connections from the machines they normally use.  (Or else the SysAdmin
could set up a systemwide hosts.equiv file on the imap server computer.)

All above is correct. Actually usual ssh installations make rsh and
rlogin just links to ssh.

There is one problem with ssh (the question was posted once on this list
as well).

SSH is normally using authentication method which is much like PGP's. The
user on remote host has database with "public keys". When I use ssh to
login/execute a command, I am asked about the "passfrase"; it is then used
to get "private key" from "key ring" (they are tagged with user/host). I
use '"' because (although very much like) all these are _not_ the same as
in PGP. 

It means, when Pine starts ssh to execute /etc/rimapd, ssh will need to
ask me passfrase. What happens in this case? At least the display will be
mangled.

It is possible to use "secrity server" - it is a program which is started
at login, asks me about passfrase, keeps it and then passes it on to ssh
over open file descriptor/named pipe/temporary file - what a given OS
supports.

Also someone reported, that ssh takes significant time to verify request,
so Pine times out. I think, it happens, when sshd (ssh server) is started
from inetd by request - it computes session key on every invocation, and
it can take some time.

So, the main problem of ssh without security server is how to ask user
about passfrase.

Thank you for the reply.  We need IMAP4 for Netscape Communicator 4.0 preview
1.  Communicator fails with IMAP2bis.  Currently, we are not sure exactly
which feature it uses but it claims it needs IMAP4.

Hello,
My name is Karen Johnson.  My email address is johnsok@elmo.nmc.edu

I have been having trouble emailing my boyfriend in montreal for 3 days
now.  I never had problems sending him things before, and do not
understand why I am now.  I have done it hundreds of times in the past.
He gets very worried, and it is costing me a fortune, because I have to
call him on the phone to tell him I am fine.

I can access my account OK, I can recieve email OK, I can compose email, I
can send it locally OK, but a % sign shows up,when I try to email him, and
it takes forever, then finally it says writing fcc, message sent and
copied to sent mail, which I thought means it is working, but it isn't.
He has gotten none of my messages for 3 days now.  Where are they going, I
have not gotten them back.  Why is it not going through?  What is stopping
it?  Why is it taking forever?  I have tried everything, and I just don't
know what to do. My support staff here has been no help at all.

I know he can recieve email, because he gets the virtual flowers, and
cards I send him off the internet.  So why can I not get my email to go
through to him???  What is happening to it????

I need some help, and do not know who to call, or who to write to.
Please any help you can give me, would be greatly appreciated.  I am at my
wits end as to what the problem is.

Thank you, Karen Johnson

	He gets worried and *you* have to call him?

	It is too bad your support staff can't be of help since it
sounds like a local problem which can be hard to diagnose halfway 
across the globe.

	Anyway, you say a % sign shows up but you don't say where.
You don't say if emails to everyone else works and it is just this
one person you're having trouble reaching.

	In your setup/config, do you have an entry for your SMTP-server?
Are you 100% sure the address is correct?  Have you asked someone with
an account on the same system to send and email to test?  Maybe the
system admin can send one for you??  Also, if the system admin is
really willing to help they should be able to look in the syslog file
to see how a recent message you sent traversed the system.

	Regards,

		Ed

Richard,
This implies that you don't need Pine 4.00 at all, you just need an
IMAP4-compatible IMAP server.  These are available now, from multiple
sources.  (See www.imap.org)  As always, the UW imap server is available
at ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap.tar.Z

The above version complies with the very latest (IMAP4rev1) specification
in RFC2060.

How can I get pine to "remember" my password when I log on. Right now,
everytime I log on to pine from unix, it picks up my user - id and asks 
me to confirm it and then asks for my password. I've seen others, however
who just get automatically logged on when the enter pine.
If anyone out there can help, I would appreciate it.

Thanks

I'm using Pine3.94 and trying to add a Reply-To: header.
I changed the .pinerc config file like this:

  customized-hdrs=Reply-to: [e-mail address]

but no luck.  Am I missing something?

Sometimes, certain users are put in a special group by the systems
administrator so they do not have to put in a password to get their e-mail.  

You should ask your systems administrator if this is the case.

Hello,
I have been having problems with sending email for 3 days now to canada.
I can send out email to people locally, but when I send out email to
friends in Montreal, it has a window come up with 0%, and it sits there
for a very long time, then finally it says, writing fcc, message sent and
copied to sent mail.  But it does not go there, I don't know where it is,
and it has not been returned to me.  My friends have not been recieving
anything I am sending.  I have tried many times in the past 3 days.  

If any one has any help for me I would appreciate it, my local support is
not answering my call for help.  I have tried many times to email them,
and have no number to call them at. My computer is fine, and everything to
get into my account is working fine. I just do not know what is going on
with why I can not get it to go out to Canada. It was fine just a few days
ago.  I can email all over the united states though. It is just not making
any sense.  He is still getting email from all of his other friends around
his area, and down her in the u.s. too.  I do not know what to do to fix
this problem.

Thank you, Karen Johnson johnsok@elmo.nmc.edu

Is there a way (some flag/key ?) to make pine NOT read full message in the
memory before it displays the message ? Sometimes I get huge messages (say 500k)
and if by mistake I press <return> on one of them, I am stuck for next few
seconds, even if I didn't really want to read that. Any help appreciated.

Hi, I'm using PINE 3.93 for Linux. Does anybody know how to send
messages in MIME format ? I mean to send accents and Latin1 characters
through a listserver but it seems that Pine is using UUENCODE and they
end up looking quite ugly...

Thanks in advance,
                       Pau

On January 1, 2000, this value will go to 

	last-time-prune-questioned=100.1

It's not exactly elegant, but that value really isn't meant for human
consumption anyway.  I think everywhere else Pine defaults to using
four digit years, so it should not be a problem.  If anyone does spot
a problem, please let us know!!!

[ Remove "*" from e-mail address before replying!  Spam bait. *sigh* ]

You can recompile PINE with the ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM definition NOT
commented out.  This allows From: to be displayed in the customized
composition headers list.

However, while this will be adequate for most recipients for the purposes
of Reid (the poster of the original question), it leaves behind the
Sender: or X-Sender: lines with your real user ID.

As you can see from my .signature file below, I insert "*"'s to head
off (further) scanning of my e-mail addresses from my postings, in a
(vain?) attempt to reduce the amount of spam that keeps filling up
my e-mail box.

My problem is that I don't want me real unadulterated e-mail address
to appear ANYWHERE in my e-mail/postings.

Postings are easy - my news program lets me make those changes.  E-mail
is not so easy -- PINE doesn't want to.

Can someone provide instructions for hacking PINE to permit changing
_all_ of the source address information, From: and Sender:/X-Sender:
towards this end?

(Please, no comments on making it easier for spammers to compose mail
with falsified headers -- that is so trivial to do without using any
mail client program at all that PINE's restriction is little more than
a quaint relic at this point, and truly reduces PINE's value in today's
Internet, *sigh*).

	Do you have a shell account?  If so, there are some things you can
try to see where/if your mail has gone out.  If you wish to try some things
let me know and I'll give you a set of things to try.

Subject: PCPine: memory crashes and Postponed Folder
Date: Thu, 9 Jan 1997 11:13:59 -0500
Message-ID: <Pine.PCP.3.95.970109110303.-26729A-100000@[155.41.110.9]>

With PCPine I often have a memory problem, and PCPine crashes with the
message something like "Problem detected: Pine exiting". This gets worse
as messages get longer.

My proposed solution: regularly postpone messages, especially as they get
longer.

But, I have just discovered that when PCPine crashes, it trashes my
Postponed Folder. The folder disappears! I can undelete it, but it then
contains 0 bytes.

Does anybody have a better solution?

PS: Would it be possible in future to compile PCPine so that it can use
extended or expanded memory. I have more than 3.5 Mb free memory on my PC
which PCPine doesn't appear to want to use.

Yours

Gregor

  I can't think of any easy way to do this.
  Modify the source code and re-compile, maybe?

It seems the "enable-unix-pipe-cmd" under UNIX might do it...

    There are two aspects of doing this.  1) You must be able to enter
the characters from your keyboard.  2) You must inform Pine so that it
will handle your message properly when you send it out.

    2) is easy: just go into your personal configuration and set the
character-set value to "ISO-8859-1" (note that iso-latin1-8859 probably
does not exist); that way Pine will know that it has to deal with more
than just US-ASCII characters.  In the latest versions of Pine, there
is also an option to try to use 8-bit transmission, so that Pine may
not have to send out Quoted-Printable.

    1) has no single answer.  It all depends on your personal setup
(such as, but not limited to, what editor you are using).

Ummm... you may well have succeeded, but just not realised it...

When you add a custom header it doesn't get shown on the message
composition screen by default.  Instead you have to ask to see it (along
with the other items in the set of "rich headers").  You do this by
putting the cursor on any of the visible header lines of the message you
are composing and then typing ^R (Rich Header).

If your Reply-to: field then appears (with a value filled in if you set
one) then you have succeeded.

If you want the header to appear by default on the message composition
screen then you need to set up the "default-composer-hdrs" variable too.
Do read the built-in help about this before changing its value, though.

Finally, I guess you already know this but to prevent confusing others...

If you add a Reply-to: header the syntax is typically _not_:

	customized-hdrs=Reply-to: [e-mail address]

But either:

	customized-hdrs=Reply-to: pmb1@york.ac.uk

or better:

	customized-hdrs=Reply-to: Mike Brudenell <pmb1@york.ac.uk>

(ie, no square brackets)

Cheers,

Hi!

I believe I'm right in saying that Pine doesn't know anything about
UUencode at all.  Instead it uses the standard MIME character encoding
techniques: Quoted Printable and Base64.

Quoted Printable is used for the Message Text, when there are a few (less
than 5%?) non-US-ASCII characters present.  The rest of the Message Text
is in clear text.

A character encoded in Quoted Printable becomes "=XX", where "XX" are the
two hexadecimal characters representing its character code.

Obviously mapping a single character to three isn't terribly efficient
when there are lots of them.  So if the Message Text contains a
significant proportion of non-US-ASCII characters the entire Message Text
is converted to Base64 encoding, which is not directly readable by humans
(at least, none that I know!;-)

Any files attached to a message using Pine are _always_ encoded in this
way.

Another trigger involves Message Text with overly long lines.  I think the
breakpoint is about 1,000 characters(ish), but can't remember whether this
triggers Quoted Printable or Base64.  I _think_ the latter.

When a message contains Quoted Printable or Base64 encoded text this
should be clear from the headers.  For example, the message you sent out
containing your question included some accented characters, and included
these headers:

	Content-type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
	Content-transfer-encoding: quoted-printable

The latter signifies that the message includes Quoted Printable items.
These will be decoded again by recipients' mail programs.  The former
header identifies which character set was in use by the sender's mailer.
If a recipient's Pine is set up to use a different character set then it
will give a warning at the start of the message when it is viewed.

So basically Pine is _already_ using MIME encoding.  The fact you aren't
seeing it once the articles have passed through the list server may
indicate a problem with it or its configuration.

You can test this by sending a message from Pine to yourself and seeing
what it looks like.  Then try sending a similar message through the list
server.  If the first works but the latter is garbled then the finger
tends to point at the list server.

Try checking the headers of problem messages you receive relayed through
the list server.  (You can do this using Pine's "H" (Full Headers)
command.  If Pine complains that this is not a valid command you will
first need to set the "enable-full-header-cmd" option in the Setup
Configuration screen.)

Finally, you may not know that Pine 3.95 is the current version of Pine
(and has been for a while now).  You may like to mention this to whoever
looks after Pine on your computer system and see if they can be persuaded
to upgrade.

Cheers,

Date: 15 Jan 1997 06:29:52 GMT
Message-ID: <slrn5douat.4s0.sp_robi@Elvira.home>

I first noticed this when I was using Pine 3.93. I have since installed
Pine 3.95, and the same thing occurs, so I wonder if a) I'm doing
something wrong, b) something is set-up wrong on my machine, c) this
phenomena has never been reported, d) <insert possible explanation>.

I should start by pointing out that this is on a Linux 2.0.0 machine.
Generally things run fine on the machine, and I'm pleased with its
performance.

I have 2 remote inboxes set-up in Pine, each on a different machine.
When I read mail from either one, Pine launches an rsh process to complete
the request. When I exit Pine, though, the rsh process still exists,
(sometimes it's sleeping, a few times it's been swapped out of memory --
depending on what I did between exiting Pine, and checking process
status'). It simply seems to have been stranded.

Is there something I'm missing, not seeing, or otherwise confused about?

	The pine system here at Duke seems to just wrap long lines.  I 
accidently specified a binary file instead of a text file when I wanted 
to read a file into the body of a message.  The system complained about 
the long lines and said it was wrapping them.  What showed up on my 
terminal screen after that certainly *looked* like straight binary and 
not some conversion.  It was *not* a pretty sight.  8-)

I'm using Pine 3.93 on Linux 2.0.0. Do you mean these options in the
setup menu ?
                 ...
            [ ]  disable-keymenu
            [X]  enable-8bit-esmtp-negotiation
            [X]  enable-8bit-nntp-posting
            [ ]  enable-aggregate-command-set
                 ...

Are they OK like this ? I manage to send latin characters to other
individual users, but *not* through a listserver. I've been told I need
to send them in MIME format, can Pine do this ? I didn't find any
specific option...

Thanks,
             Pau

Dear Sir/Madame,

		I would like to ask whether there is any function key for
people to look back the messages they have sent. And how to use it if
there is one.

		I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Your sincerely,
Andy.

I have two quick questions, both related to changing Internet providers.

We are running Pine 3.91, and I may have access to Unix Pine 3.95 
shortly.  Although the flag command is enabled in my 'config', it doesn't 
do much.

After hitting *, there are several choices, including 'I' for 
'important', which is the one I want.  Isn't this information intended to 
be saved until the next session, assuming of course that the message is 
not deleted.

Finally, what files make up the address book, so it can be ported to the 
new system?  Is there anything besides

.addressbook  and  .addressbook.lu
that I need to worry about?

Thanks to all group members.  A CC to

maxswn@skypoint.com

would be appreciated.

I am receiving unwanted messages on my email that I believe are some sort

them from getting to me.  If you would be so kind as to let me know how to
prevent this I would greatly appreciate it thankyou.

Use 'make ult' to compile the binaries to run on coho and chinook.

Hi, so far no problem. But when the recipient gets it what does she/he do?
It usually asks the attachment to be saved. When I save it and ftp to my
pc, try to open up with WordPerfect, it still shows garbage. 

Any help is appreciated.

I am attempting to setup Pine on VAX/VMS. I have the program compiled
and running but I seem to be running into some problems.
	When I attempt to send a message which includes an attachment to
another user on the VAX, the message is never delivered and no failure
mesage is returned.  When I check the SPOOL directory for mail meing
sent I can see the message which I sent out and at the top is the error:

	2 Error opening !AS as output

	We are using TCPware and I have compiled Pine with Netlib.

	Any assistance with this or setting up Pine on the VAX in general 
would be greatly appreciated.

					Thanks in advance

Hi. Of course we all know, pine rules. Where I am now,
I only have a PC, but PC-Pine doesn't support pop, and there's
no access to mount my mail dir from the PC. So I need some kind of
pop client utility that can periodically download my files.
Any suggestions?
	Thanks.

	Hmm..  I was about to suggest 3.95 since it compiled cleanly and is
 already running on my machine and I could send you a binary, but I guess
that's out of the question...

	It looks like iov isn't getting defined.  Seems like it may have
been pine I was going through the source on changing stuff.  It was
something...  Just make sure iov gets defined properly as what it's
supposed to be defined as.

	You can use procmail to filter incoming mail regardless of what
client SW you use.  The only thing you have to worry about is if your
client SW can access the folders which were created as part of the
filtering process.  For example, if you were to use Netscape on a PC
and filtered incoming mail with procmail the Netscape on the PC has
no way to access the folders created by procmail.

Subject: HELP! pine hangs upon exit

For the last week or so, Pine 3.94 has been hanging indefinately when I
try to exit.  It doesn't always do so, but it does more than half the
time.  I just ran it with -d9, and the tail of the debug file looks like
this:

----------------------------------------------------------
row: -2, real_row: 38, column: 0 
Select readfds:1 timeval:0,0 
Select on tty returned 1 
Read char returning: 121 y 
Want_to read: y (121) 
resume_busy_alarm 
expunge and close mail stream "/home/jstrout/mail/inbox"
q_status_message(Closing "INBOX"...) 
output_message(Closing "INBOX"...) 
comatose(44) returns:"44" 
end_signals(1) 


** Received SIGHUP **
----------------------------------------------------------
The SIGHUP is where (after about 30 seconds, though I've waited much
longer before) I finally just close the window.  (^C, ^Y, etc., all seem
ineffective; closing the window is the only way I've found to kill it.)

Any idea what might be causing this, or what I could do about it?

Most gratefully,
-- Joe Strout

Is there some way I can export my address book to a file or something of
the sort so I can mail it off to someone?  Or is it not possible.

And is it possible to retrieve a file I have on a disk (a:) and file
attach it?

Thanx!

Get some filtering program. I've enclosed the filtering.faq for all those with
similar problems:-)

Cheers,
Sushi

P.S. If you're running unix, get procmail, I've some nice anti-spamming
recipes, including the infamous "20 GB X-sources bounce".

Errr... what?!? Ok, now here's what happens: 
1. You create a file. 
2. You ftp the file to where your mail account is. 
3. You attach it to a pine mail.

No problem so far.

4. A third party gets your mail. "it" "usually" asks the attachment to be
   saved. I presume "it" is the other party's email program. 

Fine... 

5. You (?) ftp the file back home and open it. The _same_ file? You sure? What
   kind of "garbage"?

What _might_ have happened is that the WP file (let's call it the binary,
because that's what it is) did not get mime- or uudecoded. Or if it did, that
you did not decode it. Now it seems that you've opened a binary - or that
somewhere on the way some kind of unix2dos or dos2unix has eaten your file
(not possible, but I like the idea...). Why don't you send me the file and
I'll see what I can do.

Another possible explation is that you've opened a file in another format
(i.e. not WP). Maybe you could give us some clearer hints as to what OSs
you're using at home, at the university, what the third party is using as its
mailing program etc. That _really_ might help.

VIM *is* very nice. However, I should add that standard vi has a
wrap-margin setting. "set wm=10" will wrap 10 characters from the end
of line - allowing you to be requoted ad nauseum in followups without
the line wrapping around annoyingly.

AFAIK, no maximum length is specified by any RFC.

Pico is a bit stupid about line-wrapping. It should only be
wrapping the lines you type ... but that's probably too sensible.
But you never know; maybe there's an option in pico.

If pico truncates the lines as they are read in, then that is a
case of pico brain-death.

We are running AT&T Sys V, R3.2 on an Intel PC, and we would like to compile
Pico for the system as an alternative to vi.  If anyone knows if this is
possible or has done it, could you drop me a note?  We would upgrade to
a more recent version of *nix, but the stat package we're running was
compiled for this version.

Thanks in advance,

25° DOLOMITENLAUF - NEWS - ITALIANO


REGALO DI ANNIVERSARIO PER LA DOLOMITENLAUF

PIÙ DI UN METRO DI NEVE E BASSE TEMPERATURE GARANTISCONO LO SVOLGIMENTO 
DELLA GARA NELLE 
MIGLIORI CONDIZIONI POSSIBILI.

25° DOLOMITENLAUF
Lienz-Austria

Gara di Gran Fondo 65 km - Tecnica libera - Valida per la Worldloppet 
Cup 1996/97

Fra pochi giorni prenderà il via per la venticinquesima volta la 
Dolomitenlauf. I 65 km del tracciato sono già pronti e preparati al 
meglio. Più di 50 cm di neve fresca e le basse temperature garantiscono 
lo svolgimento della gara nelle condizioni ideali.

Alle 9.30 di Domenica 19 gennaio 1997 partirà la 25° edizione della 
Dolomitenlauf, inizio di tutte le maifestazioni della Euroloppet e della 
Worldloppet, alla quale si sono già annunciati i migliori atleti del 
settore. Molte le iscrizioni pervenute dalla Svezia, dalla Francia, 
dalla Repubblica Ceca, dalla Slovenia, dalla Russia e, naturalmente 
dall'Italia.
Fra le tante il pluri-vincitore Michail Botvinov (Russia) e l'Olipionico 
Maurilio De Zolt (Italia) Nemmeno il Team della nazionale Austriaca 
mancherà all'appuntamento. Fra i campioni locali Alois Blasnik e Norbert 
Ganner. Da non dimenticare la partecipazione di Francesco Moser, il 
quale ha preso parte per la prima volta ad una gara di fondo proprio 
alla Dolomitenlauf edizione 1996.

Con la 25° Dolomitenlauf ha inizio anche la combinata TIROLER-ADLER, 
della quale fanno parte, oltre alla Dolomitenlauf, la Val Casies (Alto 
Adige) e la Koasalauf. I concorrenti che parteciperanno a tutte le tre 
manifestazioni riceveranno la medaglia della combinata.

Da 18 anni un altro evento fa da contorno alla gara vera e propria: è il 
DOLOMITENSPRINT che si terrà quest'anno nello stadio di Lienz. In 
compagnia delle note di un Concerto all'aperto, gli spettatori potranno 
quindi seguire l'evento dalla partenza all'arrivo.

Alla 25° Dolomitenlauf sono attesi più di 2000 concorrenti provenienti 
da 30 Nazioni. Le iscrizioni si accettano fino a poco prima della 
partenza e la quota di partecipazione è di 500 OS per la DOLOMITENLAUF ( 
65 km ) e di 350 OS per la LIENZ-LAUF ( 25 km ). Tutti i pertecipanti 
riceveranno la medaglia del Giubileo ed il diploma.

Just asking about the possibilities.

When I used to use BlueWave off-line reader, I had numerous tagline files
for different usegroups, or to just randomly add one to my message.

Is there anyway to set up a random .sig file in PINE?

This way, I can write different things and have them appear randomly, or
maybe pick and choose.

I know PINE .sigs and BlueWave Taglines, though similar, are not the same,
and this may not be possible, since most people DO NOT CHANGE their sigs
constantly (the .sig usually used as an on-line business card).

As I said, just looking into the possibilities.

Hm? If you mean "are there yellow pages on the internet", check
www.whowhere.com. It's _nothing_ to do with pine, however.

Hi gurus,

I have the following problem using pine 3.95 :

When I send a mail with pine to  my correspondant and he replyed
with an other mailer (like elm), I don't get this reply ?? and
curiously, he don't get an error message...

Is there any configuration to apply ??
What is wrong on my Pine ??

TIA


Jean

I think that most transmissions are not 8bit-clean, so that
enable-8bit-esmtp-negotiation does'nt work. Then you should use
Mime-encoding (Pine does it for you).

	You can also "sort the index".  Using PINE 3.90 (under unix), I can 
sort by Subject, for example, by pressing $ and then S.

Subject: pine IMAP version connecting to IMAP4 Netscape Mail Server

Hello,

This is probably an obvious question but my problem is as follows:

- We are running netscape MailServer on A Windows NT server.  Netscape
runs POP3 and IMAP4 along with smtp and other proto's.

- We are _trying_ to use PC Pine 3.95 (beta) to connect and download
mail from the server to both Windows 3.11 and Win95 PCs. (main goal is
Win 3.11)

- The error message I get in pine is:
([CLOSED] IMAP connection broken (server reponse))

- from the server's side the imapd reports that the USER=???? and
HOST=UNKNOWN.  These fields are correctly filled in pine setup.

****** THE QUESTION: ******
What version of IMAP is Pine 3.95 running anyway.  Or does this problem
have a totally different cause.  My guess is that there are two IMAP
versions talking but protocols are supposed to be backwards
compatible!!!!!

Any help would be great.

Thanks,
- Eamon

Documentation Only -- I sometimes use pine as a newsreader; my longtime
newsreader has been 'nn'.  When reading news with nn, I often 's'ave
(or sh'o'rt-save) interesting messages into my 'nn' folders.  Just now
I configured the pine folder collections so that I could read these
nn-saved messages with pine also.  IT DOES NOT WORK.  Apparently 'nn'
mucks up the header information so pine can't sort out the individual
messages; pine sees just one huge message.  Rats!  Sample header below.

On a similar note:
Our ISP uses PINE for their LYNX server mail.
When I started on this server, I was told that the prYnt command would
only print on a printer connected to the network server, NOT the users
personal computer.

Now that I am a helpdesk volunteer, I have fielded many question from
people who say one of two things:
How can I print my email, or
I used to be able to use the Y command to print my email, and now I
cannot.

I could never print MY mail, because at the time, my printer driver was
set for my modem for faxes, and since my modem was in use dialing into my
ISP, I couldn't print, BUT, my sisters computer printed email with no
problem, but my brother's computer would print part of a long message,
then get all garbled, then print more.

I have asked our servers resident PINE expert, but he does not deem it
worthy to answer apparently, since it was about a month ago and I still
have not heard from him, and I have written washington U's pine support
people, who, probably because of the volume of email, have not had time to
answer, but refered me to their webpage, which contained no useful
information to this question.

So, as a last resort, I now turn to the good people of the PINE usegroup.
What is it on PINE or on your system, that will allow you to unerringly
print email off your own printer connected to a server through a dialup
account?

I REALLY would like to be able to tell the users SOMETHING other than, I
don't know, you shouldn't be able to do it anyway!

TIA.

And apparently the attempt to read an 'nn' folder with pine changes the
nn folder file, so that the next time you try to read it with nn, you
get the error message at the bottom of the screen: 
     Not a folder (no article header)
Apparently other nn folders in the same directory are not damaged.

I have included below the top of the nn folder file _before_ and
_after_ the error message appeared in nn; I cannot see any difference
in these lines, but I know the error does occur and is reproducable!

Any comments would be appreciated, in addition to "DON'T  DO  IT !!!"
Many thanks, -mr

I have been using the "standard" version of pine for some time
(successfully) and I just completed downloading & installing pc-pine 3.95.

I can send mail (such as this message) successfully, but I dont seem to be
receiving any mail using pc-pine.  If I log onto pine using the old
standard pine s/w, I can see my new mail messages, along with all of my
old messages, address book, etc. 

Q.  What do I need to do to be able to access my mail via pc-pine.

Q.  How do I copy my address book to my pc-pine address book?


Thanks.

at the ftp prompt to find out.

This appears to be a default .signature file left in your account by an 
overzealous, or at least relavitely tacky, admin.

You can put your own sig in the .signature file, or just rm the file if 
you don't want to bother with a signature.

Myself, I prefer to have a few, and ^R to read them into the bottom (as I 
have below).

The "nn" man page says in describing its save files:

          Articles can optionally be saved in MAIL or MMDF compatible
          format by setting the mail-format and mmdf-format variables.
          These variables only specify the format used when creating a
          new folder, while appending to an existing folder will be
          done in the format of the folder (unless folder-format-check
          is false).

If you use the "MAIL" format for your save files, there is a good chance
that Pine will interact with the folder in a friendly way.  Good Luck!

Hello PINErs

I'm fine working with pine, but now, I'm using a
Netscape Mail Server Ver. 2.0. I'm testing this
server and it works better than sendmail ... but
I compiled pine 3.95 whit GCC in a SPARCstation4
whit Solaris 2.5.1. The same that is running
NscpMail (Netscape Mail Server).

When I execute pine ... no problems, but when
I want to send a message (ctrl-x), it makes
a core dump locks my terminal. I though
NscpMail was the cause of the
SEGMENTATION FAULT: CORE DUMP. But I haved a
version of pine 3.91 compiled with CC under
Solaris 2.4 and I made a substitution.

With this version of pine compiled under Solaris
2.4, it not makes core dump with NscpMail.

I wondered if the patch released to pine 3.95
solve this problem ?

Thanks for your attention.

Greetings !

Atte.

On the Pine web page at 
     www.washington.edu/pine
there is a section titled "Additional Resources", and the first link
under that is "Questions and answers about Pine..."

Following that link, you'll see a section called "Usage Questions" and 
under that, a link labelled "Why doesn't 'attached-to-ansi' printing
work?"

This should help.  The meta-answer is that: you can configure Pine so that
"Y" attempts to print via any of several mechanisms.  One of those is
"attached-to-ansi" printing, which attempts to tell your PC/Mac
communications software to use a locally attached printer.  This only
works if the PC or Mac comm software understands ansi printer escape
sequences.  Alas, many comm or telnet programs do not (including the
Microsoft telnet that is bundled with Windows 95).

Hope this helps...

Fred,
Since properly configuring PC-Pine depends on the way the mail servers are
setup at a particular site, this is a question you need to direct to your
local support staff... in (y)our case "help@cac.washington.edu"

Well, you were right.  The Netscape server was bound to a different port that the usual 143.  The next problem we ran into was pine's inability to find the folders on the server to load them.

We ended up with this project on the back burner for now.

Thank for the help Mark,  you did give us a clue.

	Simply replace the comma with a period.

Well, it need not be your Pine or Pine as such.
It could be anything - just like a lost parcel.

You might as well test this by sending me a mail with your Pine and
I will reply to it using ELM2.4PL25 - and I'm pretty sure it will work.

Frequently Asked Questions about Pine

  What documentation is available for Pine?
  
   The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
   online help. Additional documentation, including a User's Guide,
   Technical Notes, Questions & Answers, and information on where to
   obtain the software, can be accessed:
     * In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/
     * Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.
          + The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
            also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection
            (from Pine's MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to
            folder-collections and choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/docs/[]
       
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  Who should I ask for help with Pine?
  
   If you need assistance with Pine, contact the technical support staff
   or computer help desk of your Internet Service Provider, school,
   university, employer -- whichever organization provided you with the
   email account on which you are using Pine. Due to the large number of
   Pine installations worldwide, the University of Washington cannot
   provide individual support services to Pine users.
   
   You may also be able to find the answer to your question through the
   Pine Discussion Forum -- see http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/
     * If you are posting a question to the Pine Discussion Forum but do
       not subscribe to it, request in your message that replies be sent
       directly to you, with a copy to the forum. (Conversely, if you are
       answering a question in the Pine Discussion Forum, be sure to
       include the inquirer's email address in your reply, since s/he may
       not be a subscriber and will otherwise not see your answer).

  Why does command X not work?
  
   Some of the Pine commands you may read or hear about have to be
   explicitly enabled in the SETUP CONFIGURATION menu, which is accessed
   from Pine's MAIN MENU, to be functional. For example, to be able to
   use the "Bounce" command, the following feature has to be checked:
     [X]  enable-bounce-cmd

   and to be able to use the "Select"/"Apply" operations, you must first
   check:
     [X]  enable-aggregate-command-set

     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  How can I filter messages into different incoming folders?
  
   Pine does not perform delivery filtering; that is the function of
   other programs, such as (on Unix hosts) "procmail" or "mailagent." For
   details on selection and configuration of such programs, see the
   Filtering Mail FAQ (by Nancy McGough) at one of the following
   locations:
   
   ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/mail/filtering-faq
   http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/mail/filtering-faq/
   faq.html
   ftp://ftp.halcyon.com/pub/ii/internet/filtering_mail_faq.txt
   
   Once you have successfully set up your delivery filtering, you will
   have new mail arriving in several different folders, in addition to
   your INBOX. You can then access these folders just like any other mail
   folder. You can also define a collection of incoming message folders
   in Pine, through which you can then TAB to read new messages. For more
   information, see Pine's internal help on the enable-incoming-folders
   feature in Pine's SETUP CONFIGURATION menu.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  How do I define my own headers like Reply-To and Organization?
  
   From Pine's MAIN MENU, choose Setup, then Config. Move down to the
   customized-hdrs option and read the context-sensitive help screen.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  Why does my message index show From: instead of To:?
  
   Applies to Pine for Unix only
   
   A number of Pine 3.95 users have reported seeing their own name,
   rather than the name of the recipient, in folder index listings of
   messages they have sent. This occurs when Pine detects the specific
   hostname of the computer on which it is running in the From: header.
   To avoid this from happening, set use-only-domain-name in Pine's SETUP
   CONFIGURATION menu to Yes; this strips the name of the specific host
   from your From: address. Alternatively, specify your domain name in
   user-domain (be sure you enter it correctly, otherwise all your
   outgoing messages will have an invalid return address! Ask your local
   computing support people if in doubt). When setting either of these
   options, also read the help screen for
   quell-user-lookup-in-passwd-file to see whether you should enable that
   feature too.
   
   Administrators of systems where Pine exhibits this behavior should
   also check the /etc/hosts file for invalid entries; as an example, it
   should read:

  123.456.78.90   hostname.domain    hostname
   not just
  123.456.78.90   hostname

   -- otherwise, users' setting of use-only-domain-name to Yes will not
   have the intended effect.

  How can I have a signature automatically appended to my mail messages?
  
   From Pine's MAIN MENU, choose Setup, then Signature. The text you
   enter in the SIGNATURE EDITOR (new in Pine 3.92) will be appended to
   all messages you compose.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  How do I send a message to multiple recipients without showing all their
  names?
  
   In Pine's message composer, with the cursor in the message headers
   area, press Ctrl-R ("rich headers"). Then read the context-sensitive
   help screens for the Bcc: and Lcc: fields.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  How can someone without Pine decipher an attachment to a message I send?
  
   Pine uses the MIME Internet standard for attaching files to email
   messages. Any MIME-capable mailer should be able to "understand"
   Pine's attachments. If the recipient of your message with attachment
   does not have MIME-capable email software, they should be able to save
   the attachment to a file and then decode that. One freely-available
   program which can decipher a MIME attachment is munpack from Carnegie
   Mellon. It is available at:
   
   ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/mpack
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  Can Pine be used with a POP server?
  
   As of version 3.95, PC-Pine cannot be used with a POP (Post Office
   Protocol) server. Pine for Unix can be configured to access the
   message INBOX on a POP3 server using the folder definition syntax

        {pop3server/pop3}INBOX

   where pop3server is the hostname of the POP3 server. However, this
   method accesses the POP server in quasi-online mode, not in offline
   mode, which POP was designed for. Accessing the inbox on a POP3 server
   with Pine does not preserve changes to message flags (New, Answered,
   Deleted, etc.) between sessions.
   
   As an alternative, a program such as fetchmail (which supercedes
   popclient) can be used to download email from a POP server to a local
   Unix account, where it can then be accessed with Pine. fetchmail can
   be obtained from:
   http://locke.ccil.org:80/~esr/esr-freeware.html#fetchmail
   
   Note: support for the offline mode of email access (using either POP
   or IMAP) is planned for a future release of Pine and PC-Pine. For a
   more detailed comparison of the POP and IMAP protocols, see Message
   Access Paradigms and Protocols at the URL:
   http://www.imap.org/imap.vs.pop.html

Hmm, maybe your umask allows this?
Mine is set to "066" - thus removing
premissions "rw" for group and world.
Maybe that's what your want?!

Assuming this decoder should work on UNIX - use mcvert!
Available as cmp/mcvert-216.shar in the nearest InfoMac mirror.
Example:  ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/mac/mirrors/info-mac/cmp/mcvert-216.shar

Assuming you need a decoder for MacOS then you should use StuffItExpander:
ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/mac/mirrors/mac.archive.umich.edu/00help/stuffitexpander4.01.sea.bin

This is Berlin, *Germany*, btw.  The Wall and all that.
There may be a nearer InfoMac mirror for you, though.

I'm new to pine, so I apologize if this is a stupid question. When I send a 
message I seem to CC: myself (through the POP server). I don't see a setting 
for this. How can I turn it off?

Thanks!

Don't know about generating random .sigs... but if you just want to pick 
and choose, you could opt to not have a set .sig file, and at the end of 
each post/letter ^R (Read File) the file you want as your .sig that time.

Messages sent by Pine are *always* in a MIME-compliant format.  If the
enable-8bit-esmtp-negotiation feature is turned on, Pine will check to
see if the SMTP server or sendmail program supports the 8BITMIME ESMTP
extension.  If it does, Pine will try to send the message with a
content-transfer-encoding of 8bit, rather than quoted-printable.  If
the server does not support 8BITMIME or the message is not valid 8bit
for some reason (e.g. a line over 1000 characters), Pine will fall
back to quoted-printable or BASE64 even with the option set.

Even if Pine is able to negotiate 8bit transmission to your server,
that does not mean your message will arrive 8bit encoded.  Part of the
8BITMIME specification is a requirement that any intermediate gateway
that cannot guarantee correct 8bit delivery must downgrade the message
to Quoted-Printable (or BASE64).

Subject: Need details on mailbox locking
Date: 17 Jan 1997 03:42:58 GMT
Message-ID: <slrn5dtta2.9nr.rnortman@xochi.tezcat.com>

I'm writing a program which operates on mailboxes on a unix system
(specifically, Solaris, but I want to make it portable).  I'm
concerned about file locking, since I don't really know that much
about it, having learned programming on OS/2 where file locking is
handled by the OS.  I know that one can use the flock() call, and also
that programs often create a file named FileToLock.lock, where
"FileToLock" is replaced, of course, with the name of the file to
lock.  If I do both, however, I could get into deadlock with another
program.  (For example, I create file.lock and then try to
flock(file).  Another prog has already flock'ed(file), and is waiting
for file.lock to disappear.)

I'm particularly concerned with coexisting peacefully with Pine.

So, if somebody can provide me with some details about this it would
be very helpful.  Sample code (preferably in C/C++ or Perl, but I know
quite a few other langs as well) would be imminently useful.  Or,
simply pointing me to some good docs would be fine.  (I've found the
mail filtering FAQ and the Pine Q & A and tech-notes already, which
were useful but didn't give enough detail.)

TIA.  Any help greatly appreciated.

Ok, I checked it and Pine does send in MIME. What I don't manage to do now
is to use the charset=ISO-8859-1 neither the quoted-printable thing, as
your headers show: 

> MIME-Version: 1.0
> Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=ISO-8859-1
> Content-Transfer-Encoding: QUOTED-PRINTABLE

I have selected it in the setup menu:

   character-set            = iso-8859-1
   editor                   = <No Value Set>
   speller                  = <No Value Set>
   composer-wrap-column     = <No Value Set: using "74">
   ...

but it seems to make no difference: my heades are still US-ASCII:

> MIME-Version: 1.0
> Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Is it enough to *write* "iso-8859-1" in the field or do I need a charset
file or something in my Linux ? Sorry if that's a naive question...

Thanx,
            Pau

Does that mean that I must (also) choose carefully my sendmail server in
order to correctly send accents ? Then, how can I know whether a server is
"8-bit" or not ?

(Many thanx to everyone, this may not make much sense in English, but for
me, writing Catalan without accents is a real pain...)

I'm downloading a list of about 600 email addresses, editing the file so 
that it's readable by Pine: NicknameTABFullnameTAB(email,email)

When I download only 20 names - it works fine in Pine.  As soon as I do 
the entire list of 600 - Pine will read the nickname and fullname - but 
as soon as I go to select the addresses, I get the error message "line 
too long."  

This leads me to believe that there is a limited amount of email 
addresses allowed for a distribution list in Pine?  If this is true - 
does anyone know the magic number?  If not - any other ideas?

We're using Pine version 3.93 on DEC Unix.

Thanks in advance!

If you turn on verbose mode for sending, you should see something like
the following if your server supports 8BITMIME:

	050 <dlm@cac.washington.edu>... Connecting to mx2.cac.washington.edu. via smtp...
	050 220 mx2.cac.washington.edu ESMTP Sendmail 8.8.4+UW96.12/8.8.4+UW96.12; Fri, 17 Jan 1997 11:44:10 -0800

	050 250-ONEX
	050 250-ETRN
	050 250-XUSR
	050 250 HELP

But the recipient of the message also needs to be recieving mail via a
server that understands 8BITMIME.  Further, any intermediate servers
the message passes through must also support 8BITMIME for the message
to be delivered in 8bit encoding.  You can tell what servers a message
has passed through by turning on full headers and looking at the
Recieved: headers. 

Good luck!

Can't live without it anymore!

	Examples:
	Q)	Reformat unto end-of-sentence
	Qp	Reformat current paragraph
	QG	Reformat until end-of-buffer
	Q'a	Reformat unto line marked with 'a'

Note:  Reformatting with Q preserves "quoted text" - even with multiple quotes:

	> > > This
	> > > is an
	> > > example
	> > This is another
	> > example
	> One more
	> time
	
Use "Qp" on this paragraph and it turns into this:

	> > > This is an example
	> > This is another example
	> One more time
	
Quote prefixes can be customized via the variables "comments".  Example:

	set comments=n:>,n:)

This defines the characters > and ) for "nested comments",
ie the can be a "prefix".  Example:

	> This
	> is an
	> example
	: This is another
	: example

Using "Qp" turns this into:

	> This is an example
	: This is another example

Cool, eh?  :-)

I avoid Windows, so I don't know.  But Mr VimWin should know:

Anyone using vi is not considered normal by non-vi people.  ;-)

Well, maybe you need pico keys for movement in vim?  Here they are:

	key	keyword		jump to ...	vim mapping (command mode)

	^A	anfang		begin-of-line	:nmap <C-A> 0
	^E	end		  end-of-line	:nmap <C-E> $

	^B	back		previous-char	:nmap <C-B> h
	^F	forward	    	    next-char	:nmap <C-F> l

	^N	next		    next-line	:nmap <C-N> j
	^P	previous	previous-line	:nmap <C-P> k

	^V	vertical	down-screen	:nmap <C-V> <C-D>
	^Y	y-up ;-)	  up-screen	:nmap <C-Y> <C-U>

Note:
You can copy and paste these commands right from the screen into your vimrc.

Of course you can also map these commands for insert mode preceding each
definition by the command ^O which jumps into command mode for one command
then returning to insert mode.  The downside of this is that you will thus
lose all the extra commands that are already mapped to these keys by default.

The probem: Ispell/spell deletes the content of a message after spell
            check. We turned off Ispell/spell.

We restricted users to their home directories ( =~ ). Ispell/spell will
write a temporary pico file to /tmp/pico .. but pine cannot write back
because of the home directory restriction.

Can we keep the restriction and use spelling?  Thanks.

I checked at avant.avant.com.tw and it doesn't have a running IMAP server.

Here's a checklist:

1) Since you are running SUN systems, did you remember to add the imap
   server into NIS (a.k.a. Yellow Pages)?

2) Was the line that you entered into inetd.conf consistant with other
   entries?  Not all inetd implementations take the same format of
   arguments in their inetd.conf file.

3) Did you remember to restart inetd?

	It means you should call your new Internet provider and
ask them.  When you see a line that starts with X- or x- it means it
is "non-standard" and the chances that anyone other than the people
who invented will know the true meaning is small.

I have two folder collections; one is on the local machine and another
one is on the remote IMAP server.  How do I copy all the folders from
the IMAP server to my local machine?  Thank you!

Subject: pico - where to get info about the latest version
Date: 15 Jan 1997 19:20:16 GMT
Message-ID: <slrn5dqbff.p99.guckes@banach.math.fu-berlin.de>

I was looking for the latest version of pico but didn't want to download the
distribution of pine - so I looked at http://www.washington.edu:1180/pine/ .
The page says that Pico is a trademark of the University of Washington -
but there is *no* special info about Pico at all!  :-(

So - what is the latest version of pico and when was it released?

I post here as I am not sure whom to contact.
Well, the man page to pico-2.8 says about "Authors":
	Michael Seibel <mikes@cac.washington.edu>
	Laurence Lundblade <lgl@cac.washington.edu>
Is it ok to bug them with questions?

Suggestions for the Pine Home Page, the "availability" page and the Pine FAQ:

	Add the latest version number of pico.
	Add the release dates of both pico and pine.
	Add a date stamp to the page.
	Add a mailto link to the maintainer of the pages (to every page).
	Add a file to ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail with info about latest versions.

Please make it more easy to look up this kind of information!
Something like http://www.washington.edu/pine/changes/ for pico
would be nice.  Thank you!  :-)

While I'm at it: A one suggestion for both pico and pine:
It would be nice if they identified with option "-v" or "--version".

Sven

PS:	I am currently unsubscribed to comp.mail.pine -
	so I am asking for email copies of followups.
	Thanks!

Hi,

I usually use Netscape's built-in mailer 
or Elm + fetchpop.

Too many peoples say that Pine is the best.
I have tryied the Pine, and failed to fugure out
what pine can do, but, say, Netscape cannot.

Thank you,
Alexey

Suppose we have two logins: login "A" and login "B".
At login "A" we have created ".forward" file which will forward messages 
from "A" to "B".
When any message is mailed to "A" it forwards to "B" (well this works 
perfectly) in this process the message from "A" is deleted. Message 
appears only at "B".  We want a way through which the message also stays 
at "A" & also forwards to "B". Is there any configuration in Pine which 
we will help us to do so. Any help will be highly appreciated. Thank's in 
advance.

Take a look at Pine's configuration screen (Setup/Config from the Main

	Pine can generate *legal* MIME and headers!

	Netscrape, has this wonderful ability to put 8bit data
(un-encoded) in the headers!

There are several reasons why this could be happening.  None of which
involve the pine mailer.  You need to contact your system administrator.

Ok, but then this assumes that imapd nust be listening to port 143, right?
In most cases this will be ok, but there's bound to be the odd one...

Here's what I get when I write from pow@giga.sct.ub.es to my friend Oscar:

Seems to me that after failing (is that EHLO a "HELLO in 8-bit" ?), Pine
uses the old protocol. The problem is then in my server, Giga ? I guess I
can change it in the Pine "SMTP server" option...

Or does it mean that I just *can't* send accentuated (8-bit) stuff ??  

Thanks again,
                   Pau

I tried the Solaris 2.5(.1) /usr/bin/patch, it does not work. But
using GNU patch 2.1 on a SunOS-4.1 machine worked fine.

Pico is a "simple editor" - not a "word processor".
If you want a word processor then use one!  ;-)

(1)  Save file, print file from shell.
(2)  Use a better (non-simple) editor.

When trying to send an e-mail with a big attachment (about 14 Mb), pine
finished with the message "Bug in pine. Can't resize free space. Pine
finished". Does anyone know what happened? Is there a workaround or a patch

By the way, is there a FAQ for this newsgroup?

And here's a little more from Pine's QandA:

  How can I filter messages into different incoming folders?

   Pine does not perform delivery filtering; that is the function of
   other programs, such as (on Unix hosts) "procmail" or "mailagent." For
   details on selection and configuration of such programs, see the
   Filtering Mail FAQ (by Nancy McGough) at one of the following
   locations:

Use a mail filter to remove incoming mail.
No, pine is not a mail filter.

For deleting mail from a given address ELM's filter will do:
http://www.math.fu-berlin.de/~guckes/elm/elm.filter.html

You need to set up this kind of filter rule:
	if (from = user@main) then delete

But if you need to get fancy then you should use procmail!

I had to do the same (my new ISP doesn't support IMAP). Try Pegasus Mail 
(http://www.pegasus.usa.com/). I use it now and am quite happy with it.

This would require two things:
First, make it a mode editor, ie know about the difference whether a key is
meant to be a command or input to the text, and second, allow key binding.

Both these things are considered non-intuitive and thus is a contradiction
to pico being a "simple editor".  In short:  Forget it!

Why don't you just switch the editor over to vi?

There's a config option to not sort your address book, so you could sort
it externally and then pine won't re-sort. That's all the support there is
for this.

I am relatively new with Pine, and I am trying to set up all of my users 
to have the same alias files, distribution lists, configuration of 
printers, etc.  Is there a simple way to do this?  Also, how do I set up 
distribution lists at all.  Help is apprecitated, thanks.

The IMAP server in the Pine 3.95 distribution is at IMAP2bis level.

You probably need an IMAP4rev1 level server for Netscape.  Sources for our
IMAP4rev1 server are: 
	ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap.tar.Z

Pine 4.00 will be distributed using this version.  Pine 3.95 works fine
using the IMAP4rev1 server; for the most part it is upwards-compatible
from IMAP2bis.

Message-ID: <852800194.30954@dejanews.com>

Suppose we have two logins: login "A" and login "B".
At login "A" we have created ".forward" file which will forward messages from "A" to "B".
When any message is mailed to "A" it forwards to "B" (well this works perfectly) in this process the message from "A" is deleted. Message appears only at "B".  We want a way through which the message also stays at "A" & also forwards to "B". Is there any configuration in Pine which we will help us to do so. Any help will be highly appreciated. Thank's in advance.

Well, you can still do it with .forward in login "A"'s home directory:

logina@host.com,loginb@host.com

...someone correct me if this is a Bad Thing, but I didn't have any
looping problems w/ the above.

If your e-mail account is on a Unix machine and that machine runs sendmail,
all you need to do is create a new file called .forward in your home
directory containing the e-mail address of where you want your e-mail to
forwarded to.

file:     .forward
contents: login_name@my_email_address
perms:    640
owner:    login_name
group:    your_primary_group

I hope this helps . . . .

Enjoy . . . .

Happened to me too!

All you have to do is to press Ctrl-L (This "refreshes" the screen)

(it has always worked for me,...if it doesn't, just cancel and compose
again.)

  Huh?  I've never had any problem with the 'v'iew command, it displays

view for a type pine can and does display in the main window.

I think the best way to do this is from outside of pine. Either FTP them
to the local machine, or use Z-modem or some such. (If you're using IMAP,
I guess FTP will be the option). On the remote machine, in your home
directory, there's a directory called mail which contains all your mail
folders.

A bit of a way around this would be to do the following (this is what I 
used to do on my VMS account.):

o Have a directory filled with the individual files, given numerical names.
o Have a script that checks how many files there are, then randomly 
generates a number that will fit in this range (ie 001 - xxx).
o This script could then be used to change a .sig-pointer file to point 
to the chosen tagline file.

Other options would be to have it search through a text file for <CR><CR> 
seperated tags, and chose one of these randomly, but this is a bit trickier.

The program sigrot does exactly this, and does it quite well. I use it
from pine by calling it in an output filter. The source is freely 
available on sunsite.unc.edu and its mirrors.

Message-ID: <gagnonjo.853633517@tornade.ERE.UMontreal.CA>

I just installed PC-Pine 3.95 on my computer (I'm on Win95), and I'm
trying to connect to my Unix account with my OTHER account, with a PPP
connection.  The HELP file does not help me that much, and it seems I
can't configure Pine to retrieve mail from the remote server. 

Does the error message "[BBOARD failed: Can't open mailbox *Mail/[]: no
such bboard]" ring some bell to someone, and can anybody help me?

I have a very specific reason to use Pine, so don't suggest changing
software, I'm already using another one, but I HAVE to use this new
version of Pine also for some operations... 

If you could be kind enough to also send the answer by e-mail, in case my 
mail server screws up, which happens sometimes..., I would be glad.

Hopefully,

At 4:22 in the morning, people get strange ideas sometimes...
Here's mine for today:
IF you're getting mails like that on a regular basis, why not invoke emacs
(e.g.) as your alternate editor and cut the tags? Just my $.02
Personally, I prefer a nice procmail recipe that bounces mail composed with
Netscrape - after all, what people use this thing for a mailer? *chuckle*
Fat chance you'll miss something important this way... >:->

Robin

I still haven't found a way to change pine's behaviour when replying to
messages with several possible recipients. I would still like a feature like
"chose one of these five for TO and the others for CC or BCC". Did I miss
anything or is something like that planned?

Robin

Unfortunately, pine currently has no way of configuring the filename.  
Maybe, you should send a suggestion by pressing "b" from the main menu 
and selecting the option to send one.  As for the command, I would 
recommend "sz -a" instead of plain "sz" so the end-of-lines can be converted.

procmail runs on Slowaris and allows to filter *any* incoming mail.
It's particularly good on deleting mails with Content-Type: text/html ...

Right, I'm moving.
The problem is that everything started in PINE environment.

Can anybody help us to know is there any way in pine for auto response. 
Meaning: If somebody E-mails us, then he/she will "Automatically Receive 
an Acknowledgement" saying  "Thank you for your E-mail. We will get back 
to you shortly etc... ". Keeping in mind that we are not logged in at 
that particular time when the mails comes. Something very similar to 
answering machine. Hope I am not asking for more ??? please help.

In PINE, you can configure Download Command so that Export has an option
to use a Unix command to send the file directly to a PC.

I used
sz _FILE_
also plain
sz

and the file downloads correctly, BUT is has a random file name instead of
the Subject.

How can I configure it to either
1. let me enter a filename prior to download
2. take the Subject as the default?
TIA

Maybe putting one name in the To: field and the remainder could be set up 
as a distribution list (if these names are always the same) and the 
distribution list name would be put in the Cc: or Bcc: field.

	That is not one of the features which is intended for pine
to address.  (There's a pun in there someplace....  :-) )

	Anyway, you can do that very simply with your .forward file
and a script.

	In your .forward file you can put:

\localaddress
"|cat - >> /path/to/some/script"

	This will cause the mail to be delivered to your mailbox normally
and will also pipe the contents of the email to the "script" as STDIN.
You then simply parse the input put for the proper From: and send the
response.

	Warning: This will send a response to any and every message sent!!
This may cause undesirerable results.  You'd be better advised to
use a mail filter program such as procmail and use the rules to determine
when/if to send a response.

	Regards,

		Ed

Thanks for the info David.  I just did this on halcyon but
I must have the platform (xxx above) wrong.  Here's what
happened after downloading, uncompressing, and untarring:

 nancym@coho:/scratch/nancym/imap> uname
 ULTRIX
 nancym@coho:/scratch/nancym/imap> make ULTRIX
 make: *** No rule to make target `ULTRIX'.  Stop.
 nancym@coho:/scratch/nancym/imap> make ultrix
 make: *** No rule to make target `ultrix'.  Stop.
 
I've crossposted this to halcyon.general with hopes that
someone in one of these groups can help.  What is the
best way for me to find out the platform - uname didn't
seem to give me the info I need.

Thanks much,
Nancy

PS - If anyone at Halcyon has mbxcvt compiled, could you mail 
me the path?  Thnx!

Hi, I'm using PINE 3.93 for Linux 2.0.0. Does anybody know how to send
messages in MIME format ? I mean to send accents and Latin1 characters
through a listserver but it seems that Pine is using UUENCODE and they
end up looking quite ugly...

Thanks in advance,
                       Pau

So your spell checker finds that your text is ok.  What's wrong with that? ;-)

        I'm going to guess here...but maybe you should try "build ult" in the 
same spirit as the "build ult" command in pine??  You can even try
"vi Makefile" and see what targets are supported.

    Another option is a perl script called "signify".  It creates random
sigs on the fly in a rather nice manner.  I just have a script that runs it
and my editor at the same time so my .sigs are constantly randomly
generated.

I log onto a shell account from a PC at my house.  The shell account uses
Pine for E-mail.  Sometimes I just don't won't to tie up the phone for
long periods of time reading and responding to messages.  I use e-mail for
recreational purposes and sometimes have 250 or more messages a night.  Is
there a Pine for PC that would allow me to download my messages from my
shell account and read them on my PC offline?

Thanks for your consideration.

What is the setting of your inbox-path?  It looks like you have it set to
"*Mail/[]".  This is not correct, and looks like a rather bizarre
combination of a folder collection and a news specification (in other
words, it's not right for anything).

An inbox-path in PC-Pine should look something like
	{foo.bar.com}inbox
only you substitute the name of your UNIX server system for "foo.bar.com".

Correct... I was assuming that if someone is able to set up the IMAP
server on a non-standard port then they'd have enough nouse to realise to
put that port number into the above once they know the syntax exists.

One has to make _some_ assumptions at times.  (sigh:-)

There are two "systemwide" configuration files that the SysAdmin can use
to configure Pine.  Both usually live in the /usr/local/lib directory
(although you can change this by modifying the source code and recompiling
if you wish).

The "pine.conf" file provides default settings for Pine users.  The users
can override values set up in this file.

The "pine.conf.fixed" file provides 'fixed' settings for Pine users, which
they cannot override in their personal settings.

You can get a template pine.conf file by giving the command:

	pine -conf >pine.conf

and then copying this to /usr/local/lib.  Edit it to set any defaults you
wish.  Then make a copy of it as pine.conf.fixed and delete everything
except those settings you wish to force upon your users with no chance to
override.

Do remember to make sure that both files are readable by the users.

Address Books (providing aliases for sending messages and distribution
lists) are usually personal items.  However you can set up a systemwide
Global Addressbook if you wish, then putting the filespec of this in the
relevant configuration variable name in the systemwide configuration file.

The addressbook is of quite a simple format, with fields of entries
separated by Tabs.  Try creating a personal address book with a few
entries (including a distribution list with several entries) to see what
this is.  Alternatively someone else may take pity on you and explain the
format in detail.

After creating this you will need to create a "lookup" file for it using
the command:

	pine -create_lu <addrbk> <sort>

where <addrbk> is the name of the addressbook file, and <sort> is the sort
method to use to order entries within it.  Check the man page for Pine to
see what these are.

Again, remember to check that both the main addressbook file and the
lookup file are readable by the people they are provided for.

Cheers,

I think your solution will be to set up a remote inbox. The .pinerc file
has sufficient comments regarding how to create this. Also on my system,
(with Pine 3.95), there is a file, (which came with the sources), in a
docs/tech-notes directory called config-notes.html, which describes in
greater detail how to set it up. On your provider's system, you might look

I have installed the procmail-package. It contains a command 'lockfile',
which can be used to create semaphore files (calls have time-outs and
retries!). These files are compatible with procmail's mail-file handling.

So I process all mail with procmail's private lockfiles and lock with
command 'lockfile' these lockfiles from inside of my shell-scripts.

If memory serves there _is_ a maximum number of e-mail addresses in a
distribution list, but its somewhere around 1000 or 10,000 (or something). 

I suspect you arenot hitting this limit, but instead suffering from
exactly the error reported to you:

	"Line too long"

I think you've implicitly assumed that the comma separated list of e-mail
addresses for the distribution list has to be all on one line?

This is not true.  Instead just split the line after one of the commas and
continue the list on the next line in the file, indented a few spaces.

This can be easily ascertained by using Pine to setup a list of a few
addresses (say 5-10 longish ones) and then looking at the format of the
file produced by Pine.

Aside: if one bypasses the tools to maintain the list (ie, Pine) then one
should expect to do a bit of investigative work to ascertain the format of
the file, including in exceptional/unusual situations.  ;-)

Cheers,

To change the attribution string:

1.  Obtain a copy of the source code of Pine.

2.  Edit the text string in the appropriate program file.

3.  Compile.

4.  Install.

(There isn't yet any way to set this frill from a preference in the Setup
Configuration screen.)

Hi,
can someone tell me how to set the Header-Field Return-Path in PINE 3.95
What I tried is to set it with Setup -> Config and set customized hdrs
to
Return-Path: eckert@hmi.de 
When I check the .pinerc-File it looks ok. But when sending a mail it is
silently ignored. 
The Reply-To: Header Field I can set to my address correctly.
Why can't I set the Return-Path?

Thanks, Manuela

Here's an idea to try on such a setup (untested, since I have no access to
such a setup):

Choose a high-volume newsgroup that requires authentication (preferably not
one you really want to read, but one that will almost always have a new
article available), and put it first on the list of subscribed newsgroups.
When reading news, always read one article from this newsgroup to force
authentication, then use "q" to move on the the newsgroups you want to
read.

Well, that depends on what mail program you're using. As you're writing to
this particular list, I presume you're using pine. Now, both your and the
sender's address ought to be in the header of your mail. It says: From:XY.
That's the senders address...

If, however, you're looking for the sender's real name and address, you
might want to give "finger" (finger uzs8kb@uni-bonn.de in my case) or
www.whowhere.com or www.switchboard.com (suggested by David J. Gillett) a
try. These sites store personal information of people from all over the
world.

	The speller on this new version of Pine does not make any sense
when one is replying to a message.
	When replying to a message and requesting that the sender's
message be included, the Speller checks the spelling of both the original
message and the reply.  The old version checked only the reply.  It would
make a whole lot more sense for someone to check their own spelling.  But
it does not make any sense to check the quoted message also.
	Can this be fixed?  Or how can I change that?

Well, you don't set it - it gets added by the receiving MTA.
Thus it will not get sent - ignoring is the right thing to do.

Hi!
I have been charged with the task of becoming a Pine expert by my boss.  
I need to know if there are any terrific books out which I could read to 
learn every in-and-out?  Even a chapter or two in another book is ok, as 
long as they go into detail (I am already very comfortable with pine).

Thanks!

Pine, when using the sendmail program (or similar) to send mail and with
the enable-8bit-esmtp-negotiation option, starts it with some special
options (-bs, as the above says) in order to fully use the sendmail 
ESMTP capabilities if available.

This mode apparently allows easier forging of mail or something, and so
some sendmail programs are set up to insert a warning if any non-superuser
starts it that way.

I believe you can get rid of this warning by changing pine to use
an Internet connection to the mail server (possibly just 'localhost')
instead. This is set in the Setup/Config/smtp-server option.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

Sure enough, I am having trouble at about the 1100 mark.  I can't find
this topic covered in Pine's help screen (although I'm sure it's been
talked about in this group before.)  Anyone know where to read up on this
at?

Michelle:

A few good starting points are with Pine's own home page at
www.washington.edu/pine.  Here you can find out all the revision history,
download q&a, tech notes (a good must-read!), user guides, secrets, etc. 
And, you can get the source code there too.  I have learned much by
reading all the documentation found there, and wherever else the site may
point to.  Plus, this list is a great resource for questions pertaining to
a particular install, or getting around the quirks (?) we all know and
love about Pine. 

Hope this helps,

A week ago there were a couple of messages explaining how to get pine to talk 
to a pop server.  I lost the print out of those messages and also my school's 
news server died and is being replaced.  I'm working with a lab using PC's 
running FreeBSD and we're trying to get pine to talk with the pop server with 
no success, so any help wuold be appreciated.

Well, the source code is usually a good place to start searching for these
things.  A quick

    cd pine
    grep -i '#def.*addr' *.h

revealed that the os.h file (a symbolic link to osdep/os-XXX.h where XXX
is your platform code) contains:

    #define MAX_FULLNAME     (100)
    #define MAX_NICKNAME      (40)
    #define MAX_ADDRESS      (200)
    #define MAX_NEW_LIST     (500)  /* Max addrs to be added when creating list */
    #define MAX_SEARCH       (100)  /* Longest string to search for */
    #define MAX_ADDR_EXPN   (1000)  /* Longest expanded addr */
    #define MAX_ADDR_FIELD (10000)  /* Longest fully-expanded addr field */

Now the problem is to decide which does what :-)

Cheers,

I think I followed the example given here correctly for getting Pine
to access a POP3 account. I added this to my pinerc:
incoming-folders="POP
Account"{preferred.com/pop3}/usr/spool/mail/$USER

I can't get PC Pine to access either way. I keep getting a "Bad
Username or Password" return.

I do know that my provider is using a shadow password system.
Does this effect PC Pine?

Hello!

I have a question about pine. Since noone at this school in Japan seems to
know it, I am sorry that I have to bother you. The question is about if
there is any application in pine that enable you to store old messages.
Sometimes you may want to save a message so you can go back and read mail
you received one month ago, and I would be glad if someone can tell me how
to do this. 

Another question is about the keyboard functions. I sometimes send mail to
Sweden, and also receives mail from Sweden. The Swedish alphabet does not
match the English alphabet, so some vocals that we have in the Swedish
Language are missing or is displaced by another sign. Is it possible to
change the setup in pine so Swedish characters is available?

I am looking forward to your reply, and once again; I am sorry for
bothering you with these simple questions.

With best regards,

Assuming that you already have Pine set up to work with Usenet News...

1. Start your e-mail message.
2. Put the cursor on a header line.
3. Type ^R to see all available headers (Rich Headers)
4. Put the name of the newsgroup(s) you want to post the message to in the
   Newsgroups: header line

Note that this trick can also be used "the other way around" to send a
copy of a Usenet News article through e-mail to someone (perhaps the
original enquirer as a courtesy copy).

Cheers,

I made a couple of typos while updating our numerous global addressbooks.

The typos caused the error message: 
"Mail not sent. Sending error 554. One or more recipients failed."

My question is, does pine have a "verbose mode" that will say EXACTLY which
username(s) it didn't like? 

Mike, still have that source code in front of you?? :-)

Thanks!

Would it be possible to change the keybindings somewhere, so that I could

Hi. PC Pine doesn't support POP as far as I can tell. Fine,
I have an automated program which can download all my email to a
local file. And Pine reads it no problem (read only, but
who cares about that for now). But when I try to compose a message I get
"can't send message without and open remote folder." What's the
deal with this. Just SMTP the message.

I followed the guidelines of "tech-note.txt" from pine 3.95 release to
install the IMAP server on our mail server (Sun Sparc-2 SunOS 4.1.3) and
use pine 3.95 on my machine (Sun Ultra-Sparc1 Solaris 2.5.1) to read my
mailbox in mail server, it didn't work. I only set the inbox-path of
~/.pinerc to "{avant.avant.com.tw}inbox" to point out the location of my
mailbox.  I got the follwing error messages in ~/.pine-debug1 file.
 
IMAP mm_notify bye : {avant.avant.com.tw}inbox : IMAP connection broken
(server response)
 
IMAP 12:45:36 1/17 mm_log ERROR: [CLOSED] IMAP connection broken (server
response)

For IMAPd server installation, I setup the following 3 things:
 
1. Copy imapd to /usr/etc.
2. add "imap  143/tcp   #Mail transfer" in /etc/services
3. add "imap  stream  tcp  nowait  root  /usr/etc/imapd  imapd" in
/etc/inetd.conf
 
Please advise!

	What is pine telling you as to why it can't display the
attachments?  Maybe it is telling you something like:

	Don't know how to display application/octet-stream ?

	Tell us what pine is telling you and maybe we can help.

	Running pine3.95?  Yes, I believe you are...  Did you go to
setup/config from the main menu?  Did you search for the word "verbose"?
Maybe not, huh?  Otherwise you may have found:

	 [ ]  enable-verbose-smtp-posting    

        FEATURE: enable-verbose-smtp-posting
 
This feature controls an aspect of Pine's message sending.  When enabled,
Pine will send a VERB (i.e., VERBose) command early in the posting process
intended to cause the server SMTP to provide a more detailed account of
the transaction.  This feature is typically only useful to system
administrators and other support personel as an aid in troublshooting
problems.
 
Note, this feature relies on a specific capability of the system's mail
transport agent or configured "smtp-server".  It is possible that this
feature will cause problems for some tranport agents, and may result in
sending failure.  In addition, as the verbose output comes from the mail
transport agent, it is likely to vary from one system to another. 
 
	No source code necessary, void where prohibited....  :-) :-)

    When the cursor is in the header area, before you send the message,
press ^R (Ctrl-R) for "R"ich Headers.  You should see a field for
Newsgroups:  which you can fill in.  Then send the message as usual.

Hi Bill, I have an incoming folder set in .pinerc as follows:

	incoming-folders={pop.mindspring.com/pop3}INBOX

when I do M to get to the main menu and L to list my folders, I
can tab to this entry and it will talk to my ISP using POP3 (I
guess you leave off the /pop3 to get IMAP).  Since I run a UNIX
box with possible local mail delivery, I didn't set this as my
"inbox-path"....  This, by the way, is in Pine 3.95....

I use Pine under Linux to access a mailbox on the school's server, via
IMAP. The problem is, that on my machine I have another login name than
that at school, so when I access the mailbox, the default login name is my
local name, which mean I have to erase that and enter the correct one.

Can this be avoided, can I select the default name to use somewhere?

My guess is that the word there is 'Café'. The 'é' (e with accent)
character is an 8-bit character which is not in standard ASCII.

Some program which that message passed through is still living in the
stone age when text meant 7-bit ASCII.

I tried to test by sending an empty message to info@clari.net myself,
and my reply contains the same error. So I assume the error is somewhere
at Clarinet.

I am using (on a different account) a service from www.iname.com that
forwards my mail coming to their address to one I specify.

How do I change my reply-to address to their address, so that my outgoing
mail has their address for the return address, instead of mine?

All I can seem to do is change the domain, and not the username.

Also, I am using UNIX Pine and I have it set to use their SMTP server.
Put simply,

***How do I change my reply-to address?!?!?!***

In Setup/Config, change {mailhost.whatever.se}inbox into 
{mailbox.whatever.se/user=myname}inbox. Similarly for your other

What version are you using, more exactly? (For which operating system).
Generally, it is as easy as setting the Character-set to iso-8859-1. To
enter the extra characters, you'll need to have them on your keyboard,
though.

Add "Newsgroups" to your Customized-headers in the configuration, and when
writing the message header, press Ctrl-R for Rich Headers, and you should
get a line to write the name of the newsgroup(s) on.

Thank you.  When I was looking for a failed file, I found my fault:
I didn't set TMPDIR! :(

hi all,
Is it possible send an automatic reply message ? For example 
you are away for a vacation and you want your pine reply incoming 
mails with a mail like "I am away for vacation till ..."

Is there any quick way of doing that in PINE?

Thank you

Are you sure that PC-Pine doesn't do pop3?  Try

inbox-path= {your.pop.host/pop3}

for binmail (/usr/bin/mail)

	-s "Subject of mail"

Just about covers it.

	So /usr/bin/mail -s "A report" dest@email < report.001.txt

will email dest@email with report.001.txt with a subject header of
"A report".

If you wanna set the From header then your probably better off
dricing sendmail direct which is another kettle of fish.

Well, I am sure this applies to all no-graphical mailers.  ;-)

You can link ELM with GNU readline which gives you all the editing you need -
and almost everything you never dreamed of and will never use.  ;-)

But Netscape has more buttons!  ;-)

Hi, people, sorry to bother you with this, but there doesn't seem
to be any other alternative.

All day now the Pine people at Washington have been sending me
MASSIVE email advertising saying "Thanks for using Pine, here's
some interesting new upgrades."  Screenfuls of the stuff.

I don't use Pine and don't wish to.

So I sent a message back to the sender, saying, Not interested,
please stop sending me this stuff.  

The message hit the mail-robot and returned with an automatic
reply ending "Thanks for your interest in Pine."

I have no interest in Pine.

I sent messages to other email addresses listed by the robot,
saying, Look what your silly robot did, please do not assume that
the whole world is your audience of Pine users.

These messages all got bounced by the same or other robots, all
ending with a cheery, "Thanks for your interest in Pine."

I _still_ have no interest in Pine.

Please, would somebody mail me an address read by human beings,
not robots, with whom I can lodge a mild complaint, without being
thanked once more for my nonexistent interest in Pine?

Thanks.

To do that, you don't need pine, but instead a program called 'vacation'.
It is available on most Unix systems (or, at least it was available on the
one I receive my mail on, when I used it during the Christmas holidays).

Arsenio:

Check in your Pine Configuration (from Main Menu, type "S", "C") to see if
the "enable-suspend" option is set.  This will allow you to exit Pine
momentarily and work in the shell while Pine works in the background. 

When you've finished you shell jobs, just type "fg" to bring Pine back to
the "foreground".  Don't forget this last step else you'll have a maillock
to deal with next time you start Pine.

Hope this helps!

Go to Main menu, then Setup, then Config, find the line reading 
'enable-suspend' and hit the ENTER key.  You should have an X in the box 
after that.  Now, whenever you want to shell out to Unix, do a Ctrl-Z key 
combination.  To return to pine, type fg at the prompt.

Hi!  Pine won't be able to display an attachment which is not in plain 
text.  You can save the attachment as a file in your home directory, FTP 
it to a local machine, and use another program to view the file (such as 
a word processor or graphics program, depending on what format the 
attachment is.)

[ Remove "*" from e-mail address before replying!  Spam bait. *sigh* ]

What are the occasional pauses where PINE puts a couple of asterisks
in the upper left hand corner and the disk gets very busy?

Is there some way to eliminate them or at least make them less frequent,
and if so what is the trade-off?

On my Alpha machine with 96M RAM, they aren't too bad... on my 486 at
home with 32M RAM and 1000 mail messages in my inbox (*grin*) they're
pretty obnoxious.

Thanks!

This worked, but the text was all over the place, that is, the

the line feeds had been removed.

  When you'in in the main menu, press S for Setup, C for Config, then look

That's all! Hope it helps.

Nope.  It shouldn't be too hard to add this yourself.  Take a look at

Probably not in 4.00.  We may try to put an indication in for the
incoming-folders in a later 4.x version.

With Windows 3.x when Pine is minimised and received a message - the icon
changes to red. Under Win95 however, this feature seems to be lost!

How are Win95 users to know when a message has been received ?

Thanks,
Kevin

This works for me.  Do you get any error messages?  Does your
.pine-debug file reveal anything?

Pine isn't a ftp program. It is a e-mail reader. You can 
download ,savw , export several attn at one time.

I need more information to answer the question.  Are you talking about 
downloading files from a main directory, or from an e-mail/newsgroup 
folder?  
>From an e-mail/newsgroup folder, type ; a a e   name a file, then 
download that file.
Downloading several files at a time (through my account) is done by 
listing the file names, followed by a comma and a space.  This is not 
done through pine, though.
I hope this helps.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Subject: Re: How to downloadd many files ?
.
I hope this helps:
In Pine, you can tag messages from the "Index" screen, with ";aae". The
semi-colon is the tag; the "a" is for "all" (you can also tag selected
messages by number); the 2nd "a" is for "apply", and "e" is for "export.
Then you'll be asked for a file name. Once it's named, you can go out of
pine, and at the command prompt (cam%) type "sz filename". This will
download using zmodem.
If this isn't clear, or not what you were asking, let me know.

Suzane,
If you're using version 3.95, you can type ; and use the menu that it
gives you.  You can highlight based on who the mail is from, who the mail
is going to or even the date.  It's very useful.
Hope this helps,

Wildcards can be used for downloading from the pine program.
Best way to di it is by exporting it as a series of say a1,a2,a3....
files to your unix and then using (sz a*) downloads all the files.

Press ctrl-z to go to the shell, and fg to return to pine. I think there's
an option under setup to enable this...

Date: Wed, 22 Jan 1997 23:53:36 GMT
Message-ID: <32e6a80a.1163023@nntp.ix.netcom.com>

Is there any generally-accepted technique for using procmail to bounce
messages?  The docs for procmail & filter both seem to indicate that
they're only useful for "filing" messages (which I've done
successfully), but I'd like to bounce some messages before I download
them to my client (Pegasus, which will handle this, I know).

TIA,

Kevin

The asterisks that occasionally appear in the top left corner of Pine's
screen are it telling you that it is either checking for new mail or
checkpointing your mailbox to disk.

If you want to hide the asterisks (without altering the functioning of the
checks) you can use the enable-mail-check-cue option in the Setup
Configuration screen.  Its built-in help says this:

	If set, this feature will cause an asterisk to appear in the upper
	left-hand corner of the screen whenever Pine checks for new mail,
	and two asterisks whenever Pine saves (checkpoints) the state of
	the current mailbox to disk.

If the delays are causing you problems you can reduce their frequency by
increasing the interval with which Pine checks for new mail arriving (or
even turn this check off altogether).  This is controlled by the
mail-check-interval option.  Its help says:

	This options specifies, in seconds, how often Pine will check for
	new mail.  If set to zero, new-mail checking is disabled.  There
	is a minimum value, normally 15 seconds.

Cheers,

Hi, 

I'm connected to several news-servers because they offer different 
news-groups. But at this moment i'm only using one .newsrc-file
in which all the subscribed newsgroups are listed.
That is becoming a bit inconvenient.
So, is it possible to have more than one .newsrc-file:
one for each server, i'm connected to

tnx

Pine 3.95 does not support multiple .newsrc files, I'm afraid.

Hello Pine users,

I'm new to pine (Pc-pine) and i was wondering if it's 
possible to tell pine where to find its pinerc file using some
command parameter.

Does anyone know about this feature or some way to tell pine to look
in a differnent directory, depending on the user ?

(Im trying to setup pine on a PC-NFS network with Solaris 2.4 as
file/print/imap server and DOS/WIN clients)

Anyone? Thanks in advance!

Hello,

To be able to access a given news group I had to add a second News
collection linked to a different news server. Nice, that's possible with
Pine.
But ... The news groups selected in the initial News server (News
collection) appear also in the other one ! and when I suscribe to a group
that exist only in the second news server, at next launch of Pine, it will
appear also in the first one. Thats strange - is it normal ?

I tried to post a message in a news group of the second news server I got
the warning
=09"Unknown user group: symantec.support.mac.nortonutilities.general"
However I could read a lot of messages from this group
=09I could post the message using Netscape (sorry, I really wanted to
post my message now)

Could it be a problem of name length (the group name is really huge, isn't
it).

Thank you in advance for help


Jean

Note that this does not affect checkpointing, which typically involves
a longer delay than the new mail check.

I use Pine on a UNIX box (via terminal emulator and dial-up) at home,
and I LOVE it.  (My kids do, too.)

At work, use CDE (Common Desktop Environment) on X-Windows on Sun/Solaris.
Is there a version of Pine that does all the things Pine does so well,
and uses all the same file formats, but uses the X-windows interface
to allow point'n'click operation using a mouse?

I've set the 'upload-command' (MainMenu/Setup/Config) to

kermit -r -a _FILE_

to enable shelling out from the Composer to Unix to upload a
file via Kermit which pine can then suck into the message
being composed. (Pine picks a temporary name which it puts
in place of the token _FILE_).

BUT having got the file into my home directory, pine goes
looking for it in /usr/tmp rather than in my home directory.
How can I make pine look in the right place?

No can do with mailx -- it's not MIME aware, and won't set the MIME headers
that are needed by the received client.  Elm and Pine are both MIME mailers,
but I don't think either has a command-line interface -- someone literate in
those could tell you.

You really have three choices:

· Talk to sendmail directly. This means generating all the headers yourself.
  Not advised, but this is the real hacker's way to go.

· Get a copy of metamail 2.7, and use that to compose the message, which is
  then piped to sendmail.  This is lightweight, simple, and fairly idiot proof
  software, but rather primitive.

· Get a copy of MH 6.8.3.  This is a full-featured command-line-based mail
  client, which may be more than you wish to chew off, but it will give you
  the most flexability with the least hackery.

When there is a single asterisk in the upper left hand corner, Pine is
checking for new mail.  This is usually pretty fast, but may cause a
noticable delay.  The double asterisk means that Pine is checkpointing
the folder.  With the default unix folder format, Pine has to
completely re-write the folder during a checkpoint.  Other folder
formats can be updated in place, which is much faster for large
folders.  For info on alternate folder formats, see

	*ALL* the things pine does so well??

	No, but you can try the new beta client from SUN call "roam".
I believe you can find it from their main web server:

	http://www.sun.com

	Not a bad package....but not yet up to pine standards.

Does anyone out there know if it is possible to check and see if messages

I have this set, but how do you actually access the newsgroups from your

Which IMAP server are you using?  The IMAP protocol does not have any
relationship to the format of the message store.  The UW IMAP server
supports all of the folder formats that either Unix or PC Pine do.
Other IMAP servers (e.g. Cyrus) have their own proprietary formats.

i am trying to get pc-pine to run on my computer.  (right now i am 
emailing from a telnet site with VMS-pine on it)...anyways, i am having 
two problems i was hoping you might be able to help me with:

1.  Whenever i try to send an email, pine tries to send it away and then 
comes back with the error  [Mail not sent: non local recipient 
rejected]...why is it giving me this error and how do i fix it?

2.  The second problem is a little more aggravating (because I don't now 
if their is a solution under dos)...  the program has been shutting down 
randomly on me with some type of memory error.  (out of memory or 
something of the sort...) anyways, i was hoping you might have some kinda 
suggestion here...

thanks much,

Sure, instead of having this line
kermit -r -a _FILE_

add an extra ~/  The final product will look like:
kermit -r -a ~/_FILE_

I wonder if you can take a different approach.  I have seen IMAP clients that 
can access the "folders" that Pine created on the Unix host, and use them as
such.  For example, Mail Drop and Simeon (on Mac), ML (on Unix) can all do
this.  Simeon is cross platform client (PC/Unix/Mac).  Check IMAP home for
more clients.

Indeed, it is the checkpoint that causes the (unacceptably) long
delays -- mail checks take a fraction of a second.

The answer (thanks, David Miller!) is to NOT store the "inbox"
in its default (UNIX) place of /var/mail/$USERNAME, where (for people
like myself who leave way too much mail there) it grows to a size
where checkpoint operations take tens of seconds... but instead to
either:

1. pre-process it in to folders formatted other than "all messages
   in one file" such as with procmail

2. use the "inbox-path=#MHINBOX" magic cookie in the .pinerc file,
   which makes PINE perform the equivalent of a Mail Handler "inc"orporate
   operation on new mail as soon as PINE finds the new mail in
   /var/mail/$USERNAME

Either case results in the inbox _not_ being a monolithic file which
requires lots of time to checkpoint, so the checkpoints go much faster.

Again, many thanks to David Miller for pointing this out to me!

So, why isn't that #MHINBOX magic cookie documented anywhere in the
source distribution?  :)

Not quite fair Ed. 

If Kenn sets
	enable-mouse-in-xterm
and starts pine in an xterm (which can be put into a menu option within
the window manager menus) then he can use the mouse to point and click. It
doesn't look like what most people thing of as a windows interface but it
does work (and the command set is still available).

I find it easier an quicker to use the command set most of the time but
sometimes cutting and pasting with the mouse, particularly between the
message I'm reading and the one I'm writing, is really useful.

I've tried Suns offering. I'm not one life's natural wimp'ers and 
after a couple of days of irritability went back to Pine, I did however
find it the most uncluttered example of the genre that I've seen.

I wonder how many of us are using Pine for ourselves, and perhaps the
Washington IMAP server, but supporting all sorts of horrible MUAs for
users who must have buttons to press?

Hi,
I have a MIME formate mail, I would like to reply it using MIME in pine.
What command I need use?
My pine-tool only can view but can't reply it.
Would you be kind to give the instruction to reply MIME formate mail.

        True.  I did have it set, for a while, but I turned it off again.  I 
found the need to hold down the shift key to do copy/paste within an xwindow
to be painful and confusing.

        It is a beta....but the best beta I've seen for a workstation.

        Too many of us.  :-(

        BTW, there is an up and coming IMAP client from CommTouch called  
Pronto97.  Quite nice.  I doesn't have everything pine does...and the editor 
has a way to go but it is an IMAP4 client and does support true disconnected 
mode!  Its great on those trips to India when you have to dial back in at
$US1.50/minute!

Hi, 

I am using a dos based system and have just acquainted myself with
pine. Could someone please tell me what are available for packet programs
that will download my news group messages without erasing my incomming
mail? Also, what is available for off line pine-mail readers and where
can they be found?

Thanks,

It's pretty easy... First you take a look at the help that comes with pine,
then you type ^t in the message header where it says "Attchmnt". That'll get
you to your files. Pick the one you want to send and that's it.

Cheers,
Robin

Subject: Newbie Question: setting up pine to read newsgroups
Date: 24 Jan 1997 10:17:50 -0500
Message-ID: <5cajqu$52o@qnx.com>


I'm sure this question has been asked a million times, so feel free to
reply to this via Email so we don't clutter the newsgroup:

I use QNX (POSIX-compliant, real-time OS), and we have a port of pine to
use here at work (I work for QNX), and I'm trying to configure my pine
setup for reading newsgroups.

I read a post in this group about setting up nntp-server, which I did, but
I still can't read any mail.  I have tried a few different settings for the
news-collection: field, but nothing seems to work.

Can anyone offer suggestions on setting up this field, and what other
flags/settings I should configure for this?

Thanks in advance,

Ian W. Douglas (idouglas@qnx.com)

Ed, I thought you and the pine group might be interested in the results of
your suggestion.

FYI, we are using version 3.93 (under AIX) and I had "researched" ;-) the
option you speak of.

After your reply, I enabled this option.

I purposely put a typo in user's name, in a global addressbook's distribution
list.

I then tried to send e-mail, using the Lcc: option. I still got the same
*generic* error.  HOWEVER, if I picked the regular To: option, then I got the
verbose message about exactly which user was unknown.

I suppose this has to do with the way Lcc: handles packaging the users names
for sending?

Thanks for your reply Ed. It proved an interesting experiment.

When I read a pgp signed message, my display-filter processes the message
and displays the text sans signature.  If I reply at this point, the
UNprocessed text hits the filter again.

Is that a bug, or am I doing something wrong?

To whom it may concern:

	Is it possible to create a listserve in Pine that will
automatically send messages to a mailing list?  And would I have to log in
before the messages are sent, or do they get sent out as they arrive?
Thanks.

The current Pine 3.95q release does not.  Pine 4.00 will.

Message-ID: <5camd4$2dq@ns1.nl.cis.philips.com>

When edditing a mail it is possible to go to your address-book whith
<CTRL> T ...... this command is unfortunately also the command in a VT100
terminal to start a new terminal .....
Is it possible to change this bindkey to something else ?

  There's no universal method, but some e-mail servers acknowledge the
"Return-Receipt-To:" header. Just put your e-mail address into that header
field and you'll probably receive receipts for your outgoing e-mails.

  Hope this helps.

  One of the excellent off-line e-mail and news readers is Yarn. It has a
DOS version and it uses the SOUP packet format. You only need a shell
account (since you're using Pine, I suspect you have one such account) on
which to run "uqwk", which packs e-mails and news in the SOUP format.

  For more information about Yarn, consult the news group :

alt.usenet.offline-reader

  or just search for it on the WWW.

  Hope this helps.

I have a list of Elm aliases that I want to import into a Pine

way of doing this without rewriting out all the addresses again?
That is what compatibility between elm and Pine aliases exists?

TOP and UIDL are your only choices.  Try UIDL first, since it's
faster, then TOP.  If the server supports neither, it's decrepit
anyway and  ought to be upgraded...  some pressure on ISPs from users
should fix that quickly enough ;-)

Do you have a list for what telnet and pine work fine with remote printing. 
Can it be solved.

It is possible to forward an entry from Pine's address book via email, in
which case it gets attached as an item of MIME type Application/Directory.
Is this type documented in an RFC?

Thanks in advance.

Unfortunately, Pine does not currently cache the results of a
display-filter, so it re-executes it every time it needs a copy :-(

Subject: address update needs improvement
Message-ID: <32e9b9d9.0@eagle3.eaglenet.com>

While using the pine update address book feature tonight I managed to
totally hose an address I was updating.
This to anyone familiar with data entry protocols shouldn't
have been surprising.  pico doesn't solve all problems.
The editing I was attempting was to add addresses onto the end of the address
line.  What I ended up saving would fail the
fqdn test several times over in the address book.  A form for adding addresses
needs to be implemented such that if a user wants to add another
address to an existing address pine prompts the user and
properly formats the address book.  This especially applies since pine allows only
two addresses on the to: line before requiring bcc: entries.
I use a speech synthesizer and have pine show me the cursor position on the screen
but even using these features in the editing process the cursor got lost.

My e-mail will not allow me to delete, and all of my folders indicate that
they are "read-only". I did not give it a command to lock the folders, so
I was wondering how I can take off this "lock" from my folders. Thank you,

I have scoured every FAQ, site, help screen, and WWW site I can find, but
I still know nothing about cruise mode except how to turn it on. 

So, my question is, "What can cruise mode do for me?"

Thanks.

What's probably happening is that when you start Pine, it has to attach
to the POP3 server for your mail... log you in inn other words.  That's

        FEATURE: enable-cruise-mode
        
This feature affects Pine's behavior when you hit the "Space Bar" at the end
of a displayed message. Typically, Pine complains that the end of the text
has already been reached. Setting this feature causes such keystrokes to be
interpreted as if the "Tab" key had been hit, thus taking you to the next
"interesting" message, or scanning ahead to the next incoming folder with
"interesting" messages.
	
	FEATURE: enable-cruise-mode-delete

This feature modifies the behavior of Pine's "enable-cruise-mode" feature.
Setting this feature causes pine to implicitly delete read messages when it
moves on to display the next "Interesting" message.

Enjoy! *grin*

Robin

Try chmod u+w <file/dir-name> or consult the appropriate man-page. If
unsuccessful, talk to your sysadmin - those files _must_ be both rw + mode
changeable by the owner (you).

You mean: In general? Sure... Talk to your sysadmin >;-> Actually, it'd be
quite helpful if you could state your OS and the version of pine, though. If
you're running u*ix, check your apsfilter or whatever printfilter you're
running. In pine, check if the print command is set correctly. Maybe you're
using the wrong printing command. There's an option for custom printers.
Either way, the latest versions of lpr are known to be buggy.

If you're using Dos95, get yourself LinuX... ;-)

And on the eight day, God created the manual. If consulted, it'll speak to
you and its word shall be:

   Bcc stands for blind carbon copy. Addresses listed in this field receive
   a copy of the message, but are not visible to any of its recipients,
   including even those who received the blind carbon copy. (If you enter
   addresses both in the To: and the Bcc: fields, this can cause confusion
   among the Bcc recipients, who may think they accidentally received a
   message intended for someone else -- the addresses they see in the To:
   field -- and then forward it to them, so use this feature with
   discretion.)
   
As an afterthought, here's the Lcc command, too:
   
   New in Pine version 3.92 is the Lcc (List Carbon Copy) field, which
   combines the functions of the To: and Bcc: fields. It allows you to
   select a list of addresses from your addressbook and shows the name of
   the list -- but not the individual addresses in the list -- in the
   message's To: field, while delivering a copy of the message to each
   address on the list.

Now, go to your Setup, Config and adjust your headers if you want that
option to be default or use ^R to do it on the fly.

Robin

Hi,

I compiled pine3.95 on a unix machine say, "discovery".
my home is on AFS, a network file system, and if I try to run pine 
on any other machine, say "mariner", error message is:

	who are you? ( can't get login name )

It's incovenient to have to login discovery everytime to check email.
How can I fix my problem?

    In brief, no -- Pine will not work as an automatic listserv.  It
wasn't really designed to.  It certainly would not work if Pine was not
running.  You will probably need to use other software specifically
designed for the purpose, such as Majodomo, Listserve, or Smartlist. 
Also, a word of warning.  Make sure that the policies of your
installation permit what you want to do.  For instance, my service
provider explicitly forbids running a mailing list from the type of
account I have.  (If I want to run a list, I have to buy a commercial
account.)

  Perhaps he meant "chfn". Just type this command at the UNIX prompt and
you'll be asked for various "finger" information.

  Hope this helps.

A friend of mine is having a curious problem. He has recently been
upgraded to pine 3.95 in VMS and it seems to work fine, except when trying
to post to a newsgroup. It will compose the msg and all just fine, but
when we attempt to post it it gives the error message: 
"441 article is empty"
Could anyone give us a clue as to what the problem is. Do we need to set
some value somewhere or what?? 
Any help would be appreciated.

^Z, but you have to have enable-suspend enabled in the config (if you're
using Pine 3.91 or better)

Hello:

I have the same problem if I ust Microsoft Telnet, which is the emulator
that was bundled with Windows 95.  A great emulator for Telnet is EWAN
v1.052, which can be found at http://www.lysator.liu.se/~zander/ewan.html

It's generally free, and the website supports all the questions you might
have about it.  AND, it prints using ANSI control codes.  For some reason
Microsoft Telnet doesn't accept these when passed through.  Give it a
look; you'll like it!

If you're using a Mac, there is another telnet client called NCSA TELNET,
which can be found at
http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/MacTelnet/MacTelnet.Home.html

It's also a free distribution!  Hope this helps...

Sounds similar to the problem I'm having when trying to Forward a message
with an attachement (I only get a 2 line header, one of them being the
"Attachement" tag) - I use CTRL-R to get into detailed header mode, and then
things work smoothely.

Hope this helps,

Subject: More Pinting in PINE
Date: 24 Jan 1997 19:47:06 GMT
Message-ID: <5cb3jq$e3s$1@news.sas.ab.ca>


First, I would like to thank all the people who have given me insight into
the problems with printing email on your remote compter using the prYnt
command, it has soleved alot of problems.

One it did not solve, that was brought to my attention last night was
HARDWARE problems.  I received many excellent replies concerning the fact
that some communications software do not read the pine escape sequence
characters properly, could this as well happen with the physical modem as
well?
One of our members recently upgraded from an internal 2400 to an external
14,400, and now he cannot prYnt in pine.

I informed him that it MIGHT be a modem problem and he is going to replce
his new modem with his old modem to see if things work and get back to me.

I was just curious if hardware could be a factor in pine not prynting emal
on a remote PC.

Thanks for all your help people.
Anyone know of usegroups dealing with LYNX and/or TIN as well?

Steve Thorne

A quick check with the stty program reveals that pine changes the terminal
mode into one with 'ocrnl' unset - this means that line feed characters
are not treated as newlines, but just as vertical motion.

You need to replace cat by something which will translate line feed into
carriage return + line feed - a Unix to DOS filter, essentially. The
following perl command will work:

perl -p -e 's/$/\015/' >/dev/tty

Any ideas? How do we stop this shit?

Ingenue don't care man!

Complain all you like...

HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!

I seem to be getting a bevy of UCE from what appears to be ingenue.com

Complaints to ingenue.com (cc abuse@d.n) have had zero effect, so I can
only assume that this ISP condones UCE.  Any ideas?

ALL my headers have disappeared in filed e-mails, as well as incoming.
HELP!  Can they be restored?  Although the Index command still shows the date

Any suggestions would be most appreciated.  Thank you!

In Windows 3.1 Terminal, verify the Menu item - Settings:

Two others to check if that doesn't do it.

Hope that helps.

I'm using a vax/vms system to access pine where my vax id is different
than my mail id.  How can I configure pine to put my mail id as the
default id instead of my vax/vms id?

I've done all of the above and the control^ function still doesn't work.

Assuming you are using IMAP to access your mailbox...

Change its specification from seomthing along the lines of:

	{imap.site.domain}inbox

to:

	{imap.site.domain/user=xxxx}inbox

where "xxxx" is your username for the IMAP server computer.

Cheers,

Do not assume that comp.mail.pine is an interactive manual.
I would not mind people asking where they get the manual from
or where to get the FAQ - but asking questions without having had
a glimpse at either the manual or the FAQ is inappropriate.

Moreover, as you have lynx, you can use a search engine
for the manual and even download it.  Is that so hard?

Take Altavista, for example:
Enter "title:pine & title:manual" and you will get a dozen hits, eg:

http://www.gmi.edu/official/acad/comp_ctr/pine_doc.html
http://www.iit.edu/acc/manual/pine.html
http://www.sp.utoledo.edu/pine.html
http://cavern.uark.edu/~rholder/pine_html/pineman1.html
http://www.uca.es/servicios/correo/pine/

At this I must admit, though, that these are not quite up-to-date.
But I am sure you will find Pine's home page at

You work at the help desk of that ISP?  Well, then you deserve it!  ;-)

Subject: Good advice for Attachments in Pine
Date: 19 Jan 1997 17:51:07 GMT
Message-ID: <5btmub$4ro@news1.mtholyoke.edu>

I've heard a range of advice on how to safely attach MM files, formatted 
files and programs to pine messages.  I've always pkzipped programs and 
pictures (for example) on WinTel machines, and BinHexed Mac files.  On 
mac files, I upload (to unix-based pine) in ASCII format, and attachfiles 
as-they-are.  On IBM-compat's, I upload files (usually pkzipped, but not 
always), but always uuencode before attaching a file in pine.

 In an earlier discussion in this group, I read that pine always encodes
non-printable files as Base64 (??), which seems to deal with 8-bit (ie,
non-printable) ascii.  Colleagues have argued that Mac or PC executables
or non-text object files can be safely attached to pine messages, if only
they are uploaded as binary.  Who's right? 

(BTW, does uuencode both compact files?  How about BinHex?  [I know that 
PKZip does reduce filesize]).

  A while ago I wrote a Perl program which cycles through signature files
and pick the next one in the cycle. It is used as a pipe (you pipe your
message body through this program, it will advance the sig counter to the
next sig on the cycle, and output your message body with the signature
appended at the end).

  Say if you want random sigs (instead of cycling through them), a little
modification to this program will do.

  This program is available through my home page. Just search for the word
"Perl" ...

  Hope this helps!

I think what this poster may have meant, was: is it possible to "email"
an article directly to a newsgroup, without "posting" thru a newsreader.

I'm kinda curious about this too.  I have a vague recollection of seeing
something like this before.  It inovlves an entry in the TO: field
of an email message like alt.test@newsreader.blah.blah.

Anybody have any info on this?

                                     TIA

Well, if your sendmail recognizes the recursion it will work. Better
don't
do it that way. You should use:

  \pchan, user1@foo.bar.dom

The backslash (\) before your user name inhibits further aliasing.
Without
it, you will have a loop!

True.
       Pine Information Center:  http://www.washington.edu/pine
       Source distribution:
       ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/pine.tar.Z
       Pine Technical Notes, included in the source distribution.
       
What more do you need? Besides, pine _does_ have an online-help in Setup
Config and it _does_ have a man page.

Good point.

Faulty logic, I'd say - how can they tell you not to refer to a user guide
you said you didn't have?  I must admit I really don't like your attitude.

Just my $.02.

From both the FAQ and QandA:
  Can Pine be used with a POP server?
  
  As of version 3.95, PC-Pine cannot be used with a POP (Post Office
  Protocol) server. Pine for Unix can be configured to access the
  message INBOX on a POP3 server using the folder definition syntax
           
  {pop3server/pop3}INBOX where pop3server is the hostname of the POP3
  server. 
  
  However, this method accesses the POP server in quasi-online mode, not in
  offline mode, which POP was designed for. Accessing the inbox on a POP3
  server with Pine does not preserve changes to message flags (New,
  Answered, Deleted, etc.) between sessions.

Now - this is a mailing list for the email program pine - right? Now here's
what the FAQ says:

  How can I filter messages into different incoming folders?
  
     Pine does not perform delivery filtering; that is the function of other
     programs, such as (on Unix hosts) "procmail" or "mailagent." For
     details on selection and configuration of such programs, see the
     Filtering Mail FAQ (by Nancy McGough) at one of the following

The Filtering Mail FAQ would have directed to a document called:

get yourself procmail and read the f* netiquette, especiall the part which
tells you how to respond properly without stuffing other people's inboxes
with HUGE SOAPBOXES full of "important" content.

I use this script:

#!/bin/csh -f
echo -n Enter a file name:\ ; set file = $<
mv $1 /tmp/$file
sz -ua /tmp/$file

----------------------------------------------------------------

Look freak,

The post I made was in reference to a spew of UCE that has 
been seen going out of gold.compulink.co.uk, and has been 
recently seen on the newsgroup comp.mail.pine.

I don't know where you get off with your 'holier-than-thou'
attitude, but perhaps they didn't teach you how to read
and comprehend the english language over at 
Bonn University.  Anyway, I'm not holding it against you, 
nor am I going to make erroneous statements about the 
mail you received from some mailing list I don't even know
about it.  But, since they did teach me to read and write 
the language over here in the states, I will be the first 
to inform you that I never posted ANY message to your lame
mailing list.  In fact, I posted a warning message to 
news.admin.net-abuse, demon.service, and comp.mail.pine, 
which were and still are the relevent groups and on-topic 
groups for the discussion of the UCE mailbomber who is 
using ingenue.com as a front for his illegal UCE spams.  
Since you are obviously too dense to put 1+1 together and
figure out that any post made to comp.mail.pine is prob.
getting forwarded to some mailing list, you would then 
understand that I did not intentionally post to this mailing
list you are now receiving this e-mail on.

So instead of accusing me of all this BONNifide crap, 
try and understand what is going on around you for once 
in your life...the fact remains, the criminal UCE spammer
was last seen on comp.mail.pine, so are you harboring and
defending the criminal spammer who my original post was
intended to help other people track down?  Why in HELL
did you accuse me of soapboxing and other crap when all 
I did was post the headers from the UCE spammer in question?

Do you have some kind of serious mental imbalance??

Anyway, I hope you're inbox is full of UCE in the coming months,
and whatevr you do, don't send me any more e-mail until you
can prove to me that you can read and write the language. 

BCNU,

J. Olaf

Are you using a terminal proram to connect from your computer?
Then the problem might be with that program taking the ^T as a
command and thus not passing it on to pico/pine.  Just a guess.

Pine Development Team,
I have had a problem saving this version of Pine for some time now! No
matter what I do the program refuses to install itself and here's what it
says:[Error saving configuration in file "/home/usr6/cjh5/.pinerc": Disc
quota exceeded]. Also, it pops up little messages such as:[No room for
file: Disc quota exceeded]. The problem is that in order to save disc
space I should be able to delete old saved messages and start new files
for the newer one, but it will not let me do that either. So I am left
writing this message to you for help. If anything, please reply and give
me some suggestions. Thank you!   

Yours,

Frustrated NAU student

Would it be possible to define lynx as an external viewer for text/html

On a Unix system, you could set an alternate editor, (vi, for example),
then when you're ready to print, invoke the alternate editor with the ^_
command, and print from there.

On my system Enterprise 3K, SunOS5.5.1, gcc 2.7.2, patch 2.1, I think it ran
the patch alright.  It did compile the patched version OK.  The same files
also compiled OK when mounted on a SunOS 2.4 machine with gcc 2.5.6.

X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.4 PL23]
Content-Type: text

I've seen questions like the following in the archives, but no real final
answers, so...

How can I configure Pine and Pico so they are quite secure (on a Unix machine)?

	specifically;

		- no shell escapes at all
		- no suspending of pine (full removal of ctrl-Z)
		- no ability for PICO to read in files that have
		  a "/" in them
		
I'm aware of Rsh, but that doesn't prevent reading (for example) of /etc/passwd.
I saw a reference in the archives to pine.conf.fixed, but can't find
that file in my 3.95 distribution.

Thabks for any/all help!

You're running a kernel with quota utilities. (Well, probably not you but
your ISP, but nevermind)

Ok, here's what to do (preferably in that order;-))
	1. You might also check if you're able to make/delete a file in the
	   appropriate place for your mail. If not, 
	2. Check the permissions in your home file or whatever
	   /home/usr6/cjh5/ is by means of the ls command:
	   ls -alF (or -al) <filename>
	   You ought to have write permission there.
	3. Check the permissions in your Mail-dir. If it's not ~/Mail, you
	   have a problem, because you'll have to
	4. Talk to your SysAdmin.

If 1. and 2. are true, you need to change the write permissions:
chmod u+w (or rw if you like) <filename>
should do the trick.

If you're working on your own computer, get rid of quota, because you don't
need it.

Here's what  Steve Coile  scoile@patriot.net wrote some time ago:

++---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---++---+---+---+---+---++---+---+---+---+---++
If you can identify an incoming message as being of MIME type text/html,
why not simply translate it before delivery rather than bouncing it?
If you have Lynx installed on your system, you should be able to do
something like the following in your ".procmailrc" (if you're using
procmail) (untested; use at your own risk):

:0 bf
* ^Content-type: text/html
| cat > /tmp/m$$.html ; lynx -dump /tmp/m$$.html ; rm /tmp/m$$.html

This should take all messages containing a header line starting,
"Content-type: text/html" and pipe the body of the message through the
command given, which saves the body to a file ("cat > /tmp/m$$.html"),
uses Lynx to convert the HTML to plain text ("lynx -dump /tmp/m$$.html"),
then removes the old body ("rm /tmp/m$$.html").  The output from Lynx
is captured as the new body of the message and processing of your
".procmailrc" continues.
++---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---++---+---+---+---+---++---+---+---+---+---++

Doesn't work with me, but I think it should. I'll check that with the
procmail-group.

Robin

I have had no problem printing from Pine with the Y command using dialup

of the full message not being printed in the case of a long message, as

Hi, there

I am wondering if pine can bounce back email from a certain email
address? To the sender, it will look like the address is not valid,
hopefully.

Should be "chfn" ("change finger").  It may be necessary to use ypchfn, though.

Hint:  If you are looking for a command then use "apropos" to find it:

	$apropos finger
	cfingerd, in.cfingerd (8)   - GNU finger client daemon
	gfinger (1)             - Local GNU finger system
	gfingerd (8)            - GNU finger server daemon
	hostconfig (5)          - GNU finger host configuration file
	ttylocs (5)             - GNU finger tty and host locations database
	finger (1)              - display information about users
	fingerd, in.fingerd (8C)    - remote user information server

Of course this works only if "apropos" and a whatis database is installed etc
Anyway, my point is - use the available commands and ask locally before posting!

Well, it isn't there because a sent mail usually isn't sent several times. ;-)
I am sure that you are able to save the mail to a file and resend it by
reading it into a mail.  A bounce command can be helpful, too.

	chmod o+w file

This adds write permission to a file for the owner.

Example:

	chmod o+w ~/Mail/elidab

Of course this works for a bunch of files, too:

	chmod o+w ~/Mail/*

Learn UNIX!  :-)

As the pine- FAQ would have told you, pine cannot filter mail. Check Nancy
McGough's filtering-faq at:

pine that it was ever sent.

      Also, I have been sent pictures through E- Mail and it cannot be
seen here, Can I covertit to Netscape to see it?  Thanks Dee

:TOP and UIDL are your only choices.  Try UIDL first, since it's

Please don't do what Net$crape does with their "mail" client in Navigator.
They refuse to honour the "leave mail on server", and delete the mail in
any case if the server does not support the UIDL command.  Really, really
stupid.  They delete the mail, *then* say that the option is not
supported!

I can't figure out how to get Pine to Export to directory other than

as a default?

Dominic:

Check with your school's mail administrator or IS department to see if you
have a certain disk space quota.  Most standard-issue school email
accounts (like mine) are given a certain amount of total disk space you
can occupy.  This is usually the total of your mailbox, and whatever space
the files in your home directory take up.  If this is small (less than
500k) you really don't have enough room to archive much mail.

It appears from the message headers in your mail that you are using Pine
3.95 on a UNIX Solaris system.  Usually under most UNIX configurations,
your mailbox (INBOX) is stored in a different location than Pine's
folders.  Pine's folders are stored in your home directory in a
subdirectory named "mail".  Do the "ls -la" command in that directory to
see how much space whatever files in there are taking up.

Also, try these things: 

1)  Clean out mail in your "saved-messages" folder, or in any pruned
folders you might have in your mail directory. 

2)  Consider FTPing or transfering any mail archives off of your mail
directory onto a floppy or other hard drive. 

3)  Clean out any unneeded files in your home directory.

4)  Delete any unwanted messages in your INBOX if you haven't already. 

5)  Once you know how much disk space you're allotted, run the "du -ak"
command from your home directory.  The last number that appears in the
list that follows is the total disk space your home directory occupies in
Kilobytes.  This will help you keep tabs on your disk space used (not
including what you have in your INBOX.

Hope this helps!  Feel free to write me directly for additional help or
questions.

I have never heard of anything like what you are talking of in the TO:

when I type in the name of the newsgroup there it posts it for me.

The trick of using ^R to display all the headers and then filling in the
"Newsgorpus:" header field tells Pine to use NNTP (a News style
connection) to port the article to a new server.  If the "To:" field is
also filled in then the message is e-mailed (using SMTP) to a mail server
somewhere.

It *is* possible to send Usenet News articles to newsgroups even if you
don't have access to a Usenet News server yourself.  And this _is_ done
using the "To:" field, not the "Newsgroups:" field.

The trick is to e-mail ("To:" field) the message to a Usenet News <-> Mail
gateway machine.  The "username" is derived from the newsgroup name.  In
particular, if memory serves, the usual thing is to convert a newsgroup
name of the form "alt.this.that" to "alt-this-that" (ie, change "." 
characters to "-"'s)

Thus to send a message to alt.this.that it could be e-mailed to

	alt-this-that@some.gateway.machine

Unfortunately I can't recall the IP names of any such public access
News<->Mail gateways off the top of my head.  Can anyone else?

Cheers,

Consult your local Help Desk support staff for assistance.  They should be
familiar with the disk quota mechanism on your computer systems, and have
access to correct any faults.

We (random people around the world) aren't/don't.

To print to a printer locally attached to a Macintosh (or any other
micro)...

1.  Start Pine and go to its Main Menu screen.
2.  Type "S" then "P" to get to the Setup Printer screen.
3.  Read through information.
4.  Select either "attached-to-ansi" or "attached-to-ansi-no-formfeed"
5.  Exit Setup Printer screen, saving change.
6.  Try printing a message out.

Do note that this mechanism works by the mainframe (UNIX?) system sending
some special "start printing" and "stop printing" character sequences to
your Mac's terminal program before and after the message text itself.

If the terminal emulator program you are using on your Mac recognises and
supports these "start/stop printing" sequences then it should pop-up the
usual print dialog box, ready to leap into action.

However if the sequences aren't recognised or supported by your terminal
program then it won't work.  You will either need to go back to however
you've printed up until now, or use a different (version of your) terminal
software.

One of the most commonly used terminal programs for people with Ethernet
connections is NCSA Telnet.  The latest (and last) version of this is
2.7b{4,5} (effectively the same if I recall correctly, but the b5 release
brought out the source code).  This definitely *des* support printing in
this way.

If you aren't using NCSA Telnet then either consult your local Help Desk
or try posting again here.  Either way you should provide information
about the name and version number of the terminal software you are
currently using.

Cheers,

This doesn't really sound like a problem with Pine, but is more likely to
be a problem with your computer system.  Please try seeking help from your
local Help Desk staff.

Here's a mail I received in response to my mail to the procmail group.
Doesn't work for me, either, but maybe my version of pine is bewitched.

This shouldn't be necessary. I played around with this a little bit, and
here's what works for me:

Assuming you are using pine-3.95 (I don't have access to an older version
right now), just add the following to ~/.mailcap

text/html;	lynx -dump %s

You may have to explicitly set your mailcap search path, but I didn't.

28 January 1996
Salonica, Greece

My name is Watcharaphol Kamnerdsiri, Thai Medical Cadet in Greece.
I come from Bangkok, Thailand and just got the password for internet
today, anyway, my problem is I do not know exactly about how to send the
letter to my country (Bangkok, Thailand) due to I don't have any name of
the destination (terminal) in Thailand. In case that, if I would like to
contact to any person in my university named "CHULALONGKORN UNIVERSITY",
is it possible if I would like to have a name or code for my requested
terminal (above). I felt really lonely here and I would like to take with
somebody in Thailand pass the Internet system. But my experience with this
program just only 3 months. Thus, would yoou kindly please brige me the
terminal name in Thailand for me just about 5-6 lists for examples. 

I will looking forwerd to your reply tomorrow and hope that you will
kingly give your assistance to me.

Your kindly help will be remembered.

Yours Faithfully,

WATCHARAPHOL KAMNERDSIRI

Lonely Cadet !!!

GOOD BYE

Raghu:

The best source of information is it's configuration screens.  Each of
these oprions have a help fucntion to explain what it does.  You can
access it by pressing "S" "C" from the main menu.  Give it a try.

Another source is the Pine Home Page at http://www.washington.edu/pine

Hope this helps!

Yeah, I could, but that's a stupid kludge. I can't see any reason why Pine
wouldn't let me use ö in the file name... :-/

Is there any way to apply a filter to strip parts of a subject line?  I
want to take off the numbering sequence in mailing list to allow for
proper threading.  

Is there any way to to this out side of pine?  Maybe via procmail?

The string I wish to strip off is: "[List:23432]".  Can this be done?

That is not fully true. The system hangs also when connecting to (trying
to connect to) an nntp server.

If you're looking for a particular person, you might want to use finger or
refer to the following two addresses on the internet:

www.whowhere.com
www.switchboard.com

You should find the address of your university there. Otherwise, check a
major search engine like:

www.infoseek.com
www.metacrawler.com

where you'll at least find the address of your university.

Good example, there's some more filtering software available, but procmail
is pretty neat. Check Nancy McGoughs Filtering FAQ at:

Sure.

i am using pine in a unix environment with /usr/mail being
the post office. i have a user named duffy and his INBOX is
/usr/mail/duffy.

these files keep appearing in the /usr/mail directory:

    duffy.lock.853685224.13115.columbia
    duffy.lock.853797344.18536.columbia

do these come from your software? if so, under what circumstances?
mail to this user is frequently returned with a message indicating
trouble with a lock. upon removal of these files, the mail gets
through.

That would be through one of the e-mail to usenet gateways. It wouldn't be
"direct" (in my opinion) either.

Yesterday, someone suggested using a printer that is attached to your CPU. I
really don't know Macs that well, but I don't think that's an option.

Depends on the type of connection you're trying to make. If it is to be slip
- yes, though you don't necessarily need Winsuck (has it invaded the Mac
world, too?)

  >If so where do I get it? 
  
Try www.yahoo.com, internet section - there's a whole area for winsuck.

Ok, what you need is a connection to your email-account at your university.
Talk to the sysadmin or his aides, they'll tell you what to do and most
probably provide you with tailor-made software (dial-in scripts etc.).

  >How do you forward all of your incoming pine email to another address?

Reading can be fun... for example the "forward" man page can be very
revealing:

     After aliasing has been done, local and valid recipients who have a
     ''.forward'' file in their home directory have messages forwarded
     to the list of users defined in that file.

So you need a file ~/.forward which contains the address you want the mail
forwarded to. You seem to be running sendmail, so there shouldn't be any
problems. You might want to use a simple procmail recipe, though, to make
sure that nothing "gets lost". But this is not the right place to discuss
this.

Make *sure* your .forward file meets these restrictions:
ls -l ~/.forward   Check the permission: it should say -rw-r--r--

Check the "filtering-faq", too, there's a lot more about this problem in
there: http://www.jazzie.com/ii/faqs/archive/mail/filtering-faq/.

Part 1.2     Name: dumpling

Part 1.2 is in blue.  When I select Part 1.2 an icon comes up "unknown

Pine refuses to "install itself"?  Since when does Pine do that?
Or do you mean "start up"?

> and here's what it says:  [Error saving configuration in file

Well, the disk is full.  Remove data!
Or pat your admin to install a new disk for you.
Whatever.

> Also, it pops up messages such as:[No room for file: Disc quota exceeded].

Same error as before.  Same hints.  ;-)

It?  Who won't let you delete data?  Pine?  The computer?  Admin?

Can't you just use "rm file" to delete some data?
You can do this before you start Pine, you know..

When sending mail from a HPUX system, the pine program appears to hang up.
This is most noticeable with large message being sent to a large
distribution list. However, from time to time, this hang up occurs when
sending a simple two paragraph message to a local user on the HPUX system.
Has anyone encountered this behavior and is there a way to correct it?

To whom it may concern,


I have received several messages from people that are in Octet/Stream
(voice messages) as well as people who have tried to e-mail me photos.
Pine says it cannot decode these. How can I go about getting these
messages decoded.


Thanks for your help

Hi all,

Please help!  I am using Pine 3.95 under Unix Os--Solaris from school.
Is there a way or command in pine to show all mailing in newsgroup for the
current date?   For example, today is Jan. 28, 97 and I only want to 
see newsgroup mails for Jan 28 and not the other previous days..Jan 27 and
older.   I tried using the "sort" commmand but it did not give me what I
want.    I appreciate anyone help.

Thanks
--Tim

The file is MIME encoded, probably by a Mac. You need a MIME-aware tool to
decode the file. V(iew) the attachment, S(ave) it to disk and work on it
with that tool. You'll find those at:

mime@docserver.cac.washington.edu

That is VERY serious. It requires immediate medical treatment. Try fdisk on
any HDD that does not contain u*ix.
  
  >When I select Part 1.2 an icon comes up "unknown file type".

Even worse. MUCH worse, actually... Your computer is suffering from a severe
case of GUIitis. Only large doses of CLI will help you get rid of that.

  >Any suggestions on what to do to read "dumpling?"

Why read it? If I were you, I'd rather eat it. Tastes great with pork chops
and gravy.

Before you start pine, do "touch /usr/mail/nmpurcel" - and pine should find it.

Well, if she cannot read her email - why should we send her email?

A mail transport agent tells you to not do it - so don't do it!  ;-)
This is like the signs that say that you should not cross that
bridge with a truck heavier than some weight.  Don't do it!

Hey Folks--
     
     I got this message from a friend this morning.  I'm not sure who the 
     author is, but the message is very clear!!
     
     Natalie
     
     Hello everyone,
     
     Over the Martin Luther King Jr.  weekend, I had the pleasure and
     opportunity to participate in the "The Road that Led to Freedom"
     trip, sponsored by V-103, 106 Jamz, Seaway National Bank, Southwest 
     Airlines, Ameritech and other sponsors. During this trip, we visited
     Birmingham,Selma, Tuskeegee, Montgomery and Atlanta.  I cannot begin to explain
     what an enlightening experience this was!  We went through various
     cities becoming even more familiar with Dr. King's (as well as other
     civil rights leaders) mission and vision.  We also were privileged to
     gain an abundance of information regarding the "foot soldiers" who
     assisted our leaders during the movement. There was, in particular,an issue which was brought up that will 
     effect EVERYONE so, please read on.  As everyone should be aware, in
     1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voters Rights Act.  This
     was created to allow Blacks the right to vote for an  additional twenty-five years.  You guessed
     it... 
     
     In 2007 (ten years from now), Congress will decide whether or not 
     Blacks should retain the right to vote.  In order for this this to be
     passed, thirty-eight states will have to approve an extension.  
     For me, as well as many others, this was the first time that we had 
     heard this -- thus, bringing concern to all of us!  What many Blacks 
     before us fought and 1982, President Ronald Reagan signed an
     amendment to extend this even died for as well as the milestones that
     we, as Blacks have achieved, this can be taken away from us...AGAIN!
     
         If this issue has taken you by surprise as well, I encourage
     YOU to contact your Congressperson, alderperson, senator -- anyone in
     government, that you put your vote behind and ask them what are 	
     they doing to -- firstly, to get the extension and furthermore, make 
     our right to vote a LAW.  This has to become a law in order for our 
     right to vote to no longer be up for discussion, review and/or 
     evaluation. (Remember: Blacks are the only group of people who require 
     permission under the United States Constitution to vote!)
     
           Secondly, ask your representative how can we as Black 
     individuals make our voice a louder one and become a foot soldier of 
     the present!  Bonnie DeShong, co-host of V-103's "The Monds Squad",
     who was also surprised to hear of this, will be recapping this
     weekend's events on the afternoon show.  John Davis of V-103 and CBS will also 
     have excerpts of this trip aired on Channel 2 during Black History 
     Month (dates to be determined).
     
     As Black people, we cannot "drop the ball" on this one!  We
have come too far to be  forced to take such a large step back.  So,
please let's push on and forward to continue to build the momentum towards
gaining equality.
     
           Please pass this on to others, as I am sure that many more
           individuals are not aware of this.
     
           Thanks

To you Politicians what can you say to this, to all the rest I just
thought you like to know the climate of the U.S. today and everyday.

G.H.

If I have "cruise mode" on in my configuration, I get the "next" mail when I
am at the end of a mail and press the button for "next page" (i.e. "+").

Now if I have my mails sorted in some "reverse" order, e.g. newest on top, I
would rather like to start reading the "oldest of the newest" first, and then
it would be fine to enable a "cruise mode upwards": If I go beyond the top of
the actually read mail, I would like to get the next in "upward" direction, in
my case the one that followed next in time. Actually I just get the message
"Already at start of message" ...

What do you (including the "pine makers") think about that?

Cheers,
Diti

This is not a problem with Pine, but with your computer.

In the error message Pine is telling you exactly what is wrong...  when it
tries to save a file called "\pine\pinerc" onto your "N:" disk drive it
can't because there is "No space left on device". 

This means that the disk is full up and you cannot store any more
information on it.  You need to make some free space by deleting some
files/directories from it that you no longer need (or copying them to
another disk and then deleting them from the N: drive).

Either that or you have some filter installed that does it. Try
which procmail | which mailagent | which filter
and check .procmailrc or the like for a recipe that bounces mail > 100k. You
might also want to ask your sysadmin to give you more diskspace for your
inbox. ALTHOUGH files this size ought to be handled via ftp...

Naaah - brute force never really works. If you have a nice line, send him
the X-sources. They're free and fun to read, especially when you have them 4
or 5 or ... times in your inbox.

Woah, #3 in just 2 days... Read the mail I wrote yesterday for further
explanation or read the "forward" man page.
In short, you need a file .forward in your home dir which only needs to
contain the new address:

joe/vi/vim/emacs/pico (whatever editor you're using) .forward
foo@bar.barz

That's it your MHA will do the rest.

Actually, no.  It's a solid resource, provided by the
author free of charge.  Two of our helpdesk pages here
have links to this service on Joe's web page, and it
gets a fair bit of usage, because the scripts Joseph
has written save people a lot of time and energy.  Not
to mention nerve endings.

I have just installed sprc linux ( Redhat distribution ) on a SS2 and i m
trying to install
pine-3.95.
I launch the install with the command
./build lnx
I got the following answers

cc -c  -g -Dlnx -DPOSIX -DJOB_CONTROL -DMOUSE osdep.c
cc: Internal compiler error: program cc1 got fatal signal 11

Does someone knows if it s possible to compile pine on a sparc linux box?

A friend of mine is having a curious problem. He has recently been
upgraded to pine 3.95 in VMS and it seems to work fine, except when trying
to post to a newsgroup. It will compose the msg and all just fine, but
when we attempt to post it it gives the error message: 
"441 article is empty"
Could anyone give us a clue as to what the problem is. Do we need to set
some value somewhere or what?? Any help would be appreciated.

In Pine 3.95, what needs to be set in order for messages saved to
"sent-mail" to show the recipient instead of the sender in an index
listing of the sent-mail folder?

hi!

this may be a well-known problem (or perhaps not a problem with pine
at all), but i have been unable to find any information in the faq, in
the pine web pages, or in previous posts.

i am using pine version 3.95 on a sun machine. i have discovered that
if msgs arrive (as signaled by xbiff) while pine is expunging deleted
msgs, i never receive those msgs. as loss of mail from unknown sources
is a potentially serious problem, i would appreciate any helpful
information.

thx.
pedrito (pedmayn@cs.stanford.edu)

I've been trying to get Pine 3.95 for a week now and the ftp server at
UW is down/notworking/whatever. Anyone know what's up? When it will be
up? Where I can get source for v3.95 that I can trust? Thanks.

    Not at your end, no.  Once you have put the Return-Receipt-To:
<your_address> header in your outgoing email, you have done about all
you can do.  Whether or not you will actually get a delivery receipt
from any particular recipient's site is totally dependent on how that
site is configured, and you have no control over that.  Therefore,
putting in the return-receipt header is no guarantee whatever that you
will in fact get a receipt even if the mail is delivered correctly. 

    And in any event, a receipt tells you nothing about what the
recipient actually does with the mail: for all you know, s/he may
discard it unread.  Some people may be accustomed to private mail
systems which actually do tell the sender that the mail has been read,
but there simply is no Internet-wide way to enforce this at present.

Everytime my mail server receives a message for me via sendmail, pine
marks my INBOX as READONLY.  So I have to quit and restart pine.  Is there
some way to avoid this?  

I'm running the imap 4.1-BETA server on a SunOS 4.1.4 machine, and a pine
3.95q client on a NetBSD 1.2 PC.

That is something like what I want to do, but I can't get it set  up
correctly. I want to have lynx -dump set up as the external viewer (for
View Attachments), but when I tried it, my system went berzerk.

I have already tried contacting my local support staff, and could not get
any help.

Is there any way possible to get a manual on just HOW to use Pine?

Most of us here using Pine are not used to this type of mailing system,
and reading the release notes and updates is like reading Greek!!!  We've
basically been learning by trial and error.  It's nice when you discover
something useful, but if you happen to do something wrong, you can create
your own personal nightmare!!!

I would really appreciate ANY kind of response.  Especially because they
are planning on eliminating our old mailing system, and I would really
like to learn how to use Pine before it's gone.


Thanks for listening to me complain!!!

I can't get into my msgs and the problem started Ja. 28 when I tried to
understand something at the end of a new msg. When I tried to go to the
next new msg I was unable to get it. I quit and tried to go into the
system fresh and that's when I got this Folder:(CLOSED) notice. Also. the
following comes on the screen: (unable to find newline at 18934 in
64bytes, text:<html><head></head><BODYby). Please advise. 

      Thanks. Carol Lindholm;cpl02@gnofn.org

I haven't heard of any service interruptions, and a quick scan of the
logs doesn't turn up any gaps.  What errors do you get when you try to
connect?

Yes, procmail is a good filter to do these things.
Use "formail" in a procmail recipe for this.

Proper threading is done with the info given in the References line -
not the Subject (although this may help, too).

> The string I wish to strip off is: "[List:23432]".  Can this be done?

Yes, - should be.  :-)

Using Vi notation I assume it looks like this:

	:0: fhw
	* ^Subject: \(.*\)\[List:[0-9]*\]\(.*\)
	| formail -I Subject: \1\2

Note:  Untested!  Please verify by reading "man procmailrc"!

alright, i know this sounds nefarious, but it's not... i need messages
sent by user@myhost to have as the From: address "longusername@myhost".
my linux doesn't seem to work well with usernames of more than 8
characters, and i would really like to map the login name this way.  i
know there's a sendmail remedy for this, but it requires hacking with
sendmail.cf in a way i really don't want to try.  do any of you know a
workaround?  a new option to recompile with, perhaps?

thanks

Ah, voice mails!  Print out and read them to your recorder aloud.

The InterGuru http://www.interguru.com has a site that will convert e-mail
address books between many different formats. It does so by uploading your
file, converting it, and returning a file to you.

The second poster was then worried that the site might be doing this as a
way to get addresses to send mail to.

The Interguru DOES NOT store the addresses he converts. The reason the
addresses get uploaded is because it is a [perl?] script (I think) running
on a server, rather than a Mac or Windows application.

I don't know how I could help with your needs for pico, but for pine it's
pretty simple. You create pine.conf.fixed. In it, you include the settings
you don't want your users to be able to change. The settings in
pine.conf.fixed take precedence over any others, so be sure to set only
those items you want to remain fixed.

Quoted right out of the config.html file which came with the pine 3.95
distribution:
   
   You may get a sample/fresh copy of the system configuration file by
   running pine -conf. The result will be printed on the standard output
   with short comments describing each variable. (The online help in the
   Setup/Config screen provides longer comments.) If you need to fix some
   of the configuration variables, you would use the same template for the
   fixed configuration file as for the regular system-wide configuration
   file. (If it isn't clear, the purpose of the fixed configuration file
   is to allow system administrators to restrict the configurability of
   Pine. It is by no means a bullet-proof method.) Pine will automatically
   create the personal configuration file the first time it is run, so
   there is no need to generate a sample. Pine reads and writes the
   personal configuration file occasionally during normal operation.

Hope that helps.

BTW, if you're worried about the security of /etc/passwd, just install a
shadow password system. There's one for Linux systems at sunsite.unc.edu
in /pub/Linux/system/Admin. Certainly there are similar utilities for
other versions of Unix.

Kevin, this is some further information about the topic that I recently
received.

Marla


Subject: Re: Blacks' Right To Vote..... (fwd)

Thank you for this message.  Just by way of correction, I wanted
everyone to know that a repeal of the Voting Rights Act will not result
in the loss of a right to vote for blacks.  This right was created under
the Fifteenth Amendment.  The Voting Rights Act was created to combat vote
dilution, or illegal racial gerrymandering, poll taxes, voting
requirements, Grandfather clauses, and other forms of Jim Crow politics.
At the present time, as you know, there is a backlash that we have felt in
recent Supreme Court cases.  These cases have deemed many majority-black
(maj-min) districts unconstitutional because emphasis on race is used in
their creation.  How this effects claims of vote dilution (putting blacks
in one district so as to compress our voting power) is unknown.  So rest
assured, our voting rights cannot be taken away so easily, only the
protection of our nile representational power.  ONE PERSON - ONE VOTE

What you are talking about are often called "hierarchical folders" ,I
believe, by the Pine Team.  Pine does not support these yet.  (I can't
recall if they're slated for inclusion in Pine 4.0 or not.)

An alternative that you may like to investigate for the moment is to set
up some "Folder Collections" instead.  These are additional directories
containing folders.  In the Folder List screen ("L" command) these show up
as named collections which you can quickly move between, and then "expand"
(by pressing Return) to see the folders within it.  Alternatively there is
a configuration option so that they are always expanded by default.

After setting up some collections you can move between them whenever you
are asked to give a folder name (eg, "G" command, "S" command, etc).  In
particular ^N and ^P move you between collections, and any folder name you
enter is assumed to be in the selected collection.

To set up some collections:


1.  Before going into Pine, make a directory for each collection you want
    to set up.  You can make these in your home directory if you want.

    Personally I use the sneaky trick of making them subdirectories within
    my normal mail folder (called "Mail" in my home directory on our
    setup) AND giving them names beginning with a ".".  This UNIX trick
    hides the directory from Pine's normal scan for folders within my
    Mail directory.


2.  Start Pine and go to the Setup Configuration screen.  Once there have
    a look at the built-in help for the "folder-collections" variable.


Cheers,

Nothing; That is the default, but can be changed by setting the
index-format option.

However, it does not depend on folder, but on whether the sender is
yourself or not. (I think this is different from the behavior in some
previous versions. At least everyone who changes to a modern version
keeps asking why their name does not show up in their newsgroup messages.)

What may have happened is that your exact email address has changed
(possibly simultaneously with the change to 3.95) so that pine
no longer recognizes your old messages - check the From: address
of your messages. In that case what you need to do is to go to
Setup/Config/alt-addresses and insert your old address in that field.

As a third option which I seem to remember someone mentioning, try to 
delete and then undelete your messages and see if that helps.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

Subject: annoying messages on entry

Message-ID: <5clo1t$5rg@news.fsu.edu>


With the new year initially I had a record-dec-1996 mail folder. I 
deleted all the messages in it leaving only the "record" making copies
of the outgoing. Now, when I sign on I keep getting the annoying
message
"move current "record" to "record-dec-1996"

How can I get rid of this nonesense? The first message in the record
folder is now mid January and there is no longer any record-dec-1996.

Possible, but not very likely to happen. Read the online help in the S(etup)
C(onfig) Screen or have a look at the .pinerc. Everything is explained there
briefly. For Thorough information, turn to the above address. Get the faq,
make sure to read it thouroughly and there shouldn't be any problems.  
  
Cheers,
Robin

I had this problem too.  Make sure you FTP the file in binary mode.  My
web browser grabbed it in ascii mode.  When I ran patch on it, I got this
exact message you got on four different systems.  After I got the patchfile
again with an FTP client set to binary mode, the patch program had no problem
with it.

Hello,

After posting in a french news group, I got a message telling me that I
should avoid using "QUOTED-PRINTABLE" because many news readers do not
handle it properly and that the accepted stantdard is "8bit".

In Pine is it possible to select 8bit only for the news ?

I keep getting this error message whenever I try to send or open
folders with large files (around 8Mb+).

Problem detected: "Out of free storage".
Pine Exiting.
IOT trap

There is tons of hard disk space on my system, and it has 48Mb of RAM plus
swap space, and this happens even when there's vitually no one on the
system.  What could cause this problem.

Thanks for reply.
.... but I was a bit impatient
and used GNU's patch and it worked 
just as it was described in pine-patch's documentation.


Thank you.

Using Ctrl-Z puts Pine in the 'background' -- still running, but 
basically on 'hold' until you put it back into the 'foreground' with the 
"fg" command.  Using Ctrl-Z let's you suspend Pine to do something else 
in Unix; typing "fg" puts you back to Pine again.  This can be used for 
anything you do in Unix, not just with Pine.

I've been pounding my head trying to get Pine to recognize an MH style
mailbox.  How the hell is this supposed to work?

I've used "inc" to create ~/Mail/inbox from my mailbox.  I've tried
*many* different things trying to get Pine to recognize the messages
in this folder without any success whatsoever.  What do I need to
put in my inbox specification to get to the contents of this folder???

I've tried:

    #mh/home/scoile/Mail/inbox
    #mh/~/Mail/inbox
    #mh/Mail/inbox
    #mh/Mail/inbox/
    #mh/Mail/inbox/.
    #mh/Mail

(The physical folder is /home/scoile/Mail/inbox.)

Pine doesn't complain that the folder doesn't exist, it just claims
that the folder is empty.

Please, *someone*, HELP!

Is MH style mailbox support something that has to be specifically enabled
at compile-time?

BTW, I'm using Pine 3.95 from the Red Hat Linux 4.0 distribution.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.3.91.970130175437.24649A-100000@adams.patriot.net>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Figured it out.  I used "strings /usr/bin/pine | grep -i mh" to look
through the pine executable for clues.  Saw a mention of ".mh_profile",
so I looked at my ".mh_profile" and saw that it had a single line in it:

Path: Mail

Thinking that Pine might use this information, I tried using the folder
specification:

    #mh/inbox

and Pine found it (~/Mail/inbox) just fine!  Yes!

Sorry to have bothered everyone.

Wonderful Pine tip! Thanks. 

Is there something at the post-office level (e.g. typically sendmail on
Unix systems) that needs to be configured/enabled/etc. to allow for this
confirmation to be functional?

An even better way to do this is as follows:

a) move to the sent-mail folder (or whereever the previously written
message is now stored). 

b) Save the message to the postponed folder (default name is
postponed-msgs on unix and POSTPOND for PC-pine)

c) obey the command Compose, and the message will reappear as if it had
just been postponed.

In the above it is immaterial whether the target message was incoming
or outgoing.

Well, the start/stop characters are defined by the terminal you use.
You can change these characters with "stty" - but I don't recommend it.
You will be in to some confusion.  ;-)

In Pine version 3.9 I have a folder in my mail which is locked.  When 
performing a countdown, the seconds remaining gets very low and then 
simply stops going down and the folder never unlocks.  At the same time 
a folder with the same except followed by ".lock" has arisen but contains 
none of the messages in the original folder.  How would I go about 
unlocking this original folder or saving the information in it.  Any help 
would be appreciated.

marco@chinook.physics.utoronto.ca (Marco De la Cruz):
> It it possible to spell-check a single word?

Well, yes - depending on the available commands.

The editor VIM allows to lookup words from dictionaries (word files).
You set the variable "dict" to a list of such files, and in insert mode
Just type ^X^K (control-x control-k) after typing a word and VIM will check
all dictionaries (as defined by variable "dictionary") for possible matches.
VIM will then show you how many matches it found:

	"There are 123 matching words"

Then you can cycle through the matches using ^N or ^P
to get the next or previous match, respectively.

Example setting for the variable dictionary:
set dictionary=/usr/dict/words,/local/lib/german.words

With VIM you can select a rectangle area, copy (or delete) it
and also paste it in as a rectangle area, too.

Example:

                s one of the main reason
                alternate editor (and th
                t handle rectangle comma

I don't use this often - but I sure use it.  :-)

Hi Everyone.

I try to use the send-filter to get my outgoing mail
signed via pgp.
Whenever pine calls the outgoing filter I get the following
message:

-----------------------
Enter pass phrase: cannot open tty, using stdin
 
Unable to get terminal characteristics: ioctl: Operation not supported
on socket
 
Pipe command returned error.  Hit return to continue.
------------------------

Is this a common problem?
Is there anything I can do?

Thanx,

Oliver.

Hi -

You don't mention which version of Pine or which platform it is on (UNIX
or PC).  In this case the latter is probably irrelevant, but as long as
you are using Pine 3.95 you should try taking a look in the Setup
Configuration screen (S then C at the Main Menu) for the variable:

=09enable-8bit-nntp-posting

If you put your cursor on this and ask Pine for the builtin-help about it
(type a "?") I think you may find it useful to you.  :-)

Cheers,

--=20

I had the same trouble. Pine couldn't read from the named pipe.           
So currently I'm doing this via a cron job. If you figure this out
let me know.

	From the main, go into setup, and select configuration.  Once in
the config area, scroll down until you see the option, enable-full-header.
Put an X in the box to the left.  Now exit out of config, and Compose a
message.  at the "To:" prompt, hit Crtl-R (control R), you will now see an
expanded view of your headers.  One of the addidtional options is Bcc:

Can you specify the kind of information you need?
One good source of info are the archives of newspapers.

Can MH-style folders be used as incoming folders?  I have tried
identifiying MH-style folders with the "incoming-folders" paramter,
but when I press the Tab key from my INBOX, Pine doesn't move to the
MH-style folders that contain new messages.  Is this possible?

	I was curious if attached-to-ansi (or
attached-to-ansii-no-formfeed) is capable of working under windows95?  I
am currently using Pine 3.95 on UNIX, through a hyper Terminal connection.
I have tried both, but to no avail.  Does anybody have any suggestions??

Subject: Blind Carbon Copy Question
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Hello,

I've setup a large distribution list.  When I compose e-mail I put my own
address in the To: field and the distribution list in the BCC: field.

Now, my question is, when one of the recipients in the distribution list is
prompted to reply to all recipients?  Does this mean that his/her reply
goes to everyone in the Distribution list or does it go to everyone in the
To: field.

Thank you.
Gerald Rosario

Take a look at fetchmail:

    http://www.ccil.org/~esr/esr-freeware.html#fetchmail

The latest version is 3.1.  I haven't used it for a while, but
earlier versions worked quite well.

Subject: mbxcvt questions
Date: 31 Jan 1997 13:17:30 -0500
Message-ID: <ii.854734321@shellx>

The only documentation I have for mbxcvt is this:

 usage: mbxcvt source_mailbox newtype destination_mailbox

And I know that `newtype' can be `mtx'.  Where can I find
more documentation on this?  Things I'm interested in are:

* What else can be used for `newtype', e.g., what is used for
  Berkeley mbox format?  What about mh format?

* How does mbxcvt know the format of the source_mailbox?

* Can I use mbxcvt to help me salvage a corrupted VMS-type folder?
  E.g., can I tell it to just convert messages up to the first 
  corrupted message?

Thanks for any help,
Nancy

Depending on the version of PINE you're using, you might not even need to
put anything down on the TO: field.  But that doesn't answer your
question.  When people reply to that Email, it will only go out to people
on the TO: and/or the CC: fields.

I'm sure, that was my problem.  The first time I got the patch and the
source with Netscape from www.washington.edu I had the problem on all
systems. 

When I received the first advice I got the patch from sunsite.auc.dk and I
thought it was the unset TMPDIR - variable, because it was the only
difference.

	So now it was already working, but thanks for your hint, Maletin.

HI there,
	I truly need someone's help out there.  Here is the problem.
I am using and have been using pine for a few years now.  I recently 
bought a new computer and my text and background are reversed in color.
When I sign into "general" to get to the pine menu everything is fine.
But when I type in menu or pine to get into the email my screen is black 
and my text is white.  This is disturbing to my eyes and I have no idea 
how to fix it.  It is so weird because when I firt dial in, all text is 
black and the background is white the way it should be.

Please help me.  

Sincerely
    Tracey

Dear Robert and List Members:

I too had a similar problem with Hyperterminal.  I tried
it as a last desperate attempt to solve my first dilemma
which I posted to TEKNOIDS as outlined below:

I had Procomm Plus for Windows ver 2.11 running just
dandy under WFW 3.11 with the printer port set on
LPT1.DOS under printers in Control Panel when using
my unix shell pine mail on my ISP's system.  The
printing of e-mail to my attached HP Deskjet 520
worked more consistently and reliably than on
just the LPT1 setting.  My present setup for
printer on pine is listed after the end of this
email.

So then...I put Windows 95 on the computer.  Now
my e-mail won't print...a message says it is but
the printer does not even respond.

In my pine mail setup (below) I had always had
the "Attached-to-Ansi" option selected.  Now I'm
wondering if I can use the other options here
to help my computer out since most of DOS have
been removed from Windows 95.  

Can the "personally selected print command" be
configured or the "standard unix print command"
be configured in such a way so someone using
dial-up access can use pine mail on the isp's
server and print to their attached printer
under Windows 95?  If this is not possible,
is it possible to put something in the
autoexec.bat or config.sys to help my
attached printer not to be so confused?

Thanks for any assistance.

Kathleen

TEXT OF MY PINE PRINTER SETUP:

You may "Select" a print command as your default printer.

You may also add custom print commands to the list in 
 the "Personally" selected print command" section below.

Default printer currently set to "attached-to-ansi".

Printer attached to IBM PC or compatible, Macintosh
  This may not work with all attached printers, and will 
  depend on the terminal emulation/communications software 
  in use. It is known to work with Kermit and the latest 
  UW version of NCSA telnet on Macs and PCs,
  Versaterm Pro on Macs, and WRQ Reflections on PCs.
  Printer:   attached-to-ansi
             attached-to-ansi-no-formfeed

 Standard UNIX print command
   Using this option may require setting your "PRINTER" 
   or "LPDEST" environment variable using the standard 
   UNIX utilities.
 
       Printer List: ""        lpr

 Personally selected print command
    The text to be printed will be piped into the command given 
    here.  The command is in the 2nd column, the printer name is in 
    the first column. Some examples are: "prt", "lpr", "lp", or
    "enscript".  The command may be given with options, for example 
    "enscript -2 -r" or "lpr -Plpacc170". The commands and options 
    on your system may be different from these examples.

	How can I change my font to latin2 on the IBM AIX system?  I was 
able to change it to latin2 on netscape and it worked when I sent 
mail.  Thanks.

	OK Kath, I think I may have an answer to my (and your) question.
First, you need to install a "Generic/Text Only" Print driver.  Do this
through, start, settings, printers, Add new Printer, Generic, Generic/Text
Only.  After it's installed right-click on the icon, and select
properties.  Under the details tab, click on spool settings, and select
"print directly to printer".  click OK.  Next, click on "Port settings",
and select "spool MS-DOS print jobs, and deselect check port before
printing.  Click OK.  Click on the Device Options tab, and (at the
bottom), click on the Add New Model button.  Select Generic Model.  Click
OK.  Click apply, and then OK again to exit properties.  Now, load
your Hyper Terminal session, and click File, page setup.  Click on the
printer button, and select Generic/Text Only to be your print driver.
Click OK twice (to exit page setup), and connect to your remote Host.
Now, go into Pine, and select attached-to-ascii as your default printer.

P.S.  Just for the Hell of it, I made the Generic/Text Only Printer the
default printer.  I doubt if this step was significant, but....  what harm
does it do.  I changed it back afterwards, and nothing was affected.

	All of the above changes is what I did in order to get pine 3.95
to print on my Windows95 machine through Hyper Terminal.  I'm not saying
that all of these setting are correct, or if they are significant.  It
just happens to work.  After I successfully printed, I tried using the
process of elimination to decipher what option caused this breakthrough.
But Win95 got this printing kick stuck in its stupid kernal, and wasn't
appearing to react accordingly to my changes... so who knows..... for now.


	Hope this helps :)




							Rob

It also supports some simple anti-spam measures, provided you 
have sendmail set up to refuse messages you do not want.

I want to send a post to several "comp" newsgroups.  How do I do that.
Can I use wildcards?  If I wanted to post to all newsgroups that start
with "comp" how would I do it without typing in each one.  I tried using
*.comp.* and it didn't work.  Any help GREATLY appreciated.  Thanks,

Allen

I'm looking for a binary for HP-UX 9.0x that is compiled to run with
Wyse 50 terminals? 

Does anyone have any ideas?

Thanks
