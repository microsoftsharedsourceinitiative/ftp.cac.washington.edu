X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


This message is being sent to this mailing list weekly in order to
aid readers in finding information about Pine.  Before sending questions 
to the mailing list -- which is mirrored in the newsgroup comp.mail.pine --
please consult these resources:

The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
help.  Additional information, including a User's Guide, Technical Notes, 
Questions & Answers, where to obtain the Pine software, what tools are 
available to perform tasks that Pine itself does not, and more, can be 
accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.

     - The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
       also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection
       (from Pine's MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to
       folder-collections and choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/docs/[]
    

The messages from this mailing list/newsgroup are archived.  These archives
can be accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:

       (includes a searchable index of all archived messages, and information
        on how to subscribe to this mailing list)

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the

If you have a question about Pine, chances are it has been asked before
and you can find the answer either through the searchable index of past
messages, or among the "Questions & Answers" at the URL: 

http://www.washington.edu/pine/QandA/ 
  or
ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs/QandA.txt

If you need personal assistance with using or configuring Pine, contact
the technical support staff or computer help desk of your Internet Service
Provider, school, university, employer, ... -- whichever organization
provided you with the email account on which you are using, or planning on
using, Pine.  Because system functions and configuration can vary from
site to site, they are best qualified to assist you.  (Due to the large
number of Pine installations worldwide, the University of Washington
cannot provide individual support services to Pine users at other
organizations.)

Subject: Which version of PC Pine
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


Hello,

I have been using Pine on various UNIX systems for many years, and I have
only recently heard of being able to use it on my IBM.  I have DOS 6.x,
and windows 3.11.  I would prefer a dos version, but would like to get
both, to try them both out.

Could someone tell me which version of PC Pine I should get?  I don't know
if it matters, but I have a 386DX40, mono VGA screen.

Thanks,

Joseph

Well, this sending filter just won't do (what's ~pgp supposed to do, anyway?
Or is it a typo?). Get e.g. pgp-pine by Roland Rosenfeld or papp by Aldo
Valente off the net.

Subject: problem with pine and ELM attachments
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

I already asked once about this problem, but could not get a workable
solution. I have now some more elements so perhaps somebody can help me.

 - I read my mail with pine 3.95

 - I receive mail from a colleague who is sending mail via ELM. He is not
   aware of doing anything special. He just sends "normal" mail consisting
   of plain text (no attachments)

 - however my pine sees his mails as consisting of a "text" MIME attachment.
   Of course pine shows me the text correctly without need to invoke any
   special viewer. So I can READ his mails.

 - however I wish to be able to reply to him as I usually do to everybody
   else, including his TEXT. prefixed by > signs, so that I can comment
   on his statements, editing etc.

   unfortunately when I do reply either I do not get his message included
   at all (under my default configuration), or get his message included
   as an attachment (if I tic the "include-attachment-in-reply" feature)

I have found a workaround, which is however not elegant. That is :

 - I save the mail from inbox into another folder

 - I edit the folder and remove a set of header lines

 _ I close the editor (if I don't do that pine will see the folder locked
   and hangs)

 - I reopen the folder in pine, and I am now able to treat his mails as
   normal mails without attachments.

The header lines I eliminate are the following (they occur after the "Date"
keyword and before of the "Status: RO" line) 

X-Hpvue$Revision: 1.8 $
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: Message/rfc822
X-Vue-Mime-Level: 4
X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.4 PL21]
Content-Type: text

I suppose the problem is due to the presence of a couple of Content-Type
lines. Can I just suppress one of those ? and which ?

Or EVEN BETTER what shall I tell my colleague to inhibit the creation of the
faulty lines (assumed is a fault with ELM and not with Pine) ?

This is a FAQ.  There are several well known ways of incorporating Pine
and PGP.  Check this URL for the methods that I have been using:

	http://www.pharm.med.uc.edu/~yuan/pine_pgp.html

It is quite simple, provided you are not using a stripped down Unix
(like some Linux flavors) system that lacks some tty functionalities.

Cheers!

If you're using "a stripped down Unix", try:
	(http://www.rhein.de/~roland/)
	(http://www.rhein.de/~aldo/pine.html)

They're not quite as "simple", but they work like a charm.

The error you are getting means that message #18 is not there when Pine
thinks it should have been. This is most often caused by people using
their mail from two different places: they can be both from Pine, or one
from VMS MAIL or PMDF MAIL.  In any case, if you deleted some messages
from one place, but pine had it when it opened the folder, then it will
have this problem. 

Or, it could be a bug.  What version of PMDF are you running?  That is,
what is the output of

$ pmdf version

?  It may be that you need a new PINE.EXE image from our anonymous FTP
area, ftp.innosoft.com

"Unexpected locking failure. No message of desired type"

This cryptic message has been appearing on PINE whenever I send or save a
message. The message appears & the screen locks temporarily, but then it
unfreezes after a few seconds and performs whatever the operation I was
trying to get it to perform. Any suggetstions as to what may be causing
this?

dear robot!

hi!  Help!  I am a real techie-dweeb and cannot figure the changes out
very well.  I accidently found out about typing in "pine" to get back into
my mail.  But I have found that my address list is gone... this poses a
big problem because, I now have no record of my friends and family's
e-mail addresses.  Are they hidden somewhere else that I could possibly
locate?

Please help!  Cheers, Evelyn (erich@uniserve.com)

Subject: who do i change my address?
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

How do i change my address on pine?
I recently logged into an on-line service and got me a new address. My
former address is still valid but i don't want pine to state it on the
e-mails i send. i wish that he would let me choose what address i have and
not force it automaticly. I use pine 3.95 from a Unix platform.

my new address is minder@who.net
my former address is s3864767@t2.technion.ac.il

so you can guess why i want to change it.

 I tried to change my domain name and it changed my address to
s3864767@who.net
which very inventive of it, but it's wrong. what can i do? How can i use
alt-address instead of my real one?
thanks in advance.

minder@who.net

Actually it is rather easy to get going with procmail. The NOTES
-section at the end of 'man procmail' contains all information needed
for setup, and includes some simple examples on redirecting mail etc.
More examples are found in 'man procmailex'.

Actually, I think that 3.96 has only been out a few months now. Is there 
something wrong with it? My Linux computer still has 3.95, which I've 
not bothered to upgrade yet due to the fact that I've personally had no 
problem with it, and my ISP only recently upgraded their Sun version to 
3.96

Hi!
I have a ASCII file that contains several thousand e-mail addresses (each 
address per line). I want to make this file as a distribution list of pine. 
It seems impossible to do this whithin pine.  Is there anyone who has some
suggestion ? Your help will be greatly appreciated.

We are currently using Pine, version 3.91 on a UNIX platform. We cannot 
get the bounce command to work. It remails the message back to the 
"bouncer" and not to the intended receiver. 

I would be grateful for suggestions on how to get bounce to work. Thanks!

VI-editor, EMACS ?  Format the "file" to mimic that of the addressbook and
then import the file into your addressbook.

Yes, that's right.

Several people, my humble self among them. You could have checked the pine
archive, but among the solutions offered were:

	perl
	sed
	awk
	XEmacs
	10 iyfegh typists

It's not that hard to do. How much are paying for a good script? Hehehe >;->
  
  >Your help will be greatly appreciated.

Hmmm, yes, I sincerely hope that others will feel the same. "several
thousand" sounds menacing --- you are not by any chance embarking on a major
spamming campaing, are you?

Cheers,
Robin

I saw in my Pine help section, I could report a bug to you guys.  I'm not
sure a bug is what I'm getting but I'll describe what's happening and see
if you have an idea.  I access the internet through my former college, VCU
in Richmond, Va.  I dial in from home using a Mac II via Kermit.  I have
had a subscription to a bulletin board called uscf-district42@cycling.org.
However, in the past three weeks, I haven't been getting any messages!  I
called the person who is the creator, and he said I am still subscribed.
Still I don't receive anything.  I have been getting individual e-mail
letters from people, just nothing from this bulletin board.  
Any ideas?  Thanks, Emily

Mail the text file to yourself by using CTRL-R to read it into the message
body.  When you have the message in Pine, read it, then switch to (T)ake
addresses mode.  Once in Take, switch to (L)ist mode, select (A)ll and
(T)ake the addresses, giving Pine a nickname to use for the list.  I don't
know if there's a limit on the number of names Pine can handle in a list.

Several thousand seems like an awful lot; I hope you're using this for

Hi:

I'm experiencing very poor performance with pine (tried both 3.93 and
3.95) when reading newsgroups with about 100 articles or more. It takes
several minutes to scroll through each screenful of about 25 article
headers (on a SPARCserver 1000 and an IBM RS/6000 J40)

The last time I looked at the source (a while ago), it was not clear
where the nntp commands were (if at all). Can someone point me to
technical documentation on how pine reads newsgroups using a news server
(i.e. not using local collections)?

I have not had any problems with Netscape Navigator/Communicator or tin.
I strongly suspect "misbehaviour" on pine's interaction with our NNTP
server (running INND 1.5.1).

Thanks,
Vinod Kutty.

    No.  You have to use some other software which hooks into the mail
delivery process, which Pine does not do.  Specifics would depend on
more information than you provided (and would no longer be a Pine
question).

There's a mailing list for VMS-Pine users.  (I'm not one; I just happened
to notice it.)  To subscribe to the list, send e-mail to

   VMS-Pine-Request@merrimack.edu

with the message body containing the word "subscribe" only.

(Or send e-mail to listserv@merrimack.edu with "subscribe VMS-Pine" in the
message body.)  The list owner is rand@merrimack.edu

Quick work-around: Have the employee forward the mail to himself (or
herself).  Before sending the message, he should go to the offending line
and hit CTRL-J to reformat the paragraph.

Disadvantage: The printed message will be from the employee to himself,
though the message text (if the forwarded headers are left intact) will
contain the original sender info.

Long work-around: Save the offending message to a separate folder called,
for example, print.  Suspend or exit Pine and use pico to edit the file
mail/print, reformatting the long line with CTRL-J.  Go back into Pine, go
to the print folder and print the message.  This time you'll get the "real"
message with the "real" headers.

Did this not work? What happened? Did the message get *anywhere*?

Mail forwarding is not really a function of Pine. It's a function of your Mail
Transport Agent. Pine's just a mail reading progam. You need to verify the
configuration of your MTA. For example, on my LInux box, I use sendmail as the
MTA, and in the configuration file, (/etc/sendmail.cf), there is this line:

# Forward file search path
O ForwardPath=$z/.forward.$w:$z/.forward

You might want to consider upgrading to a newer version. A few features have
been added that some users here find useful.

Hi ,
	Thanx for the message but I want to lock my mailbox everytime I
try to login. I mean whenever I login to my account and want to read my
messages, it should prompt me for a password to enter. If the password is
correct it allows me to access teh pine or else it should go back to
prompt or to the menu.
	I hope this is possible with the pine now.

Thanking you

Hmmm.... This _may_ not be a problem with Pine per se...

When compiling the INN 1.5.1 software there is a configuration option in
its config/config.data file called "LIKE_PULLERS".  As distributed this is
set to "DONT".  If INN is compiled with this setting it lets you read 100
articles within a given NNTP session.  It then continues to let you read,
but introduces a one second delay between articles.  This is so that
Systems Administrators can reduce the impact of reading sessions from
software packages which try to "suck" a newsfeed from their server.

Note that the delay is introduced after reading 100 articles within an
NNTP *session* (ie, not within any one newsgroup).  So after a session has
been used to read 100 articles things slow down dramatically.

You would not notice this effect with Navigator if, for example, it
started off a separate NNTP session (hence with its own fresh 100 article
limit) more often than Pine does.  (For example Navigator might be idiotic 
enough to start a new session for each article it reads, or for
each newsgroup you open, rather than re-using your existing NNTP
connection ... I really don't know.)

You may like to ask your News Administrator if they compiled INN with the
LIKE_PULLERS option set to DONT.  If they did then you might be able to
persuade them to change this to DO and recompile it, or else to edit the
source code and increase the 100 article limit 10, say, 1000.

Cheers,

Your problem is almost certainly caused by the defective sendmail front-
end emulation of the MMDF mail router package used by your SCO system
(it's vital to know what flavor of UNIX you're using with problems like
these. the message ID suggests you're running SCO UNIX).

You may not have noticed yet, but another problem is that the addresses
specified in blind-carbon-copy field (bcc:) will become quite visible to
each recipient (oops!). 

SCO's SMTP gateway does a much better job in handling both options. 
Simply change the "smtp-server" option in the setup configuration screen
into "localhost" (it ought to be set to "<No Value Set>" now). This does
require that your system has TCP/IP configured.

Good luck!

Kind regards,

- Richard Gering.

P.S.  Why not upgrade to Pine 3.96 in the process?

    Possibly no one answered because your inquiry is not really
relevant to comp.mail.pine.  This is about technical aspects of 
installing and using the Pine program, not a dating service.

  I'm afraid I must claim responsibility for porting PINE to VMS (well, to be
  fair, Yehavi Bourvine did the original dirty work and I finished it off).

  At present the port is for 3.91. See:
     http://alder.cc.kcl.ac.uk/fileserv/pine-vms/

  I think there's also a link somewhere in the washington home page for pine:
     http://www.washington.edu/pine/
  under 'unsupported ports'

Has anyone looked into using pine as a default unix shell? How secure is
it straight out of the box? What needs to be done to sew it up so that a
user has access to pine and only pine?

Actually, I am the co-administrator of our news server, and my colleague
already tried this, hence my post to the group.

I think I should double check the installation to make sure everything is
where it should be.

Thanks,

I have tried to install Pine on AIX 4.1.5 but with no luck.  I am able to
install it on AIX 3.2.5 with no problem.  Do anyone have Pine running on
AIX 4.1.5?

Hm? You should have a login prompt for your system, that's enough for the
rest of the u*ix world afaik ;-) Are you trying to prevent others from
reading your mail? Then you should look up a thread about umasking pine
temporary files in the archives (skip the last 90% of the thread, because it
turned into a full-blown flamewar).

There are, of course means to achieve what you want, but I'm not sure your
administrator would like those. CFS would be one that pops to my deseased
mind (Crypto File System). Maybe you could tell us what exactly you need
this kind of protection for. Besides, what do you want to "lock" the file
for? Or are you not talking of "locking" in the u*ix sense?

  >	I hope this is possible with the pine now.

Has it ever been?

Robin

*argl* You made me do *it*. I got myself the source, exploded the tarball,
said ./build lnx and this is what I got:

Making Pico and Pilot

I'm kinda tired and stuff... Anyone got a q&d solution for S.u.S.E. linux,
please?

Hmmm, Freudian slip? A secret message to everyone's subconscience? A pun?
Anyway, sorry to disappoint you, but I'm not *that* close to my keyboard.

Err... Is that a quote or something?

Subject: faster folder list seeks
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

I have large mailing lists that get archived into folders via procmail,
and it usually takes a long time for pine to parse through one of them
and display all the subject lines. How about having it seek near the end of the file,
and only attempt to grab the last 25 or so that will fit on an average screen?
Once those are displayed, it could continue working to bring in the rest.

What, I look disappointed?  Try looking at me crosseyed and see
if the view changes...
No, that wasn't a Freudian slip = it was a play on your
smart-alecky cybersex stuff from earlier.  Never mind :-)

Hello,

What I am trying to do is to install PC Pine so that I can download my 
maiol, and real it offline, to avoid being on the phone.  This was my 
understanding of what PC Pine is capable of doing.  But, I am having 
trouble choosing the right version of PC Pine from your web sight, and 
also getting it running.

I have a 386, with 4 megs, and a mono VGA card/monitor.  I downloaded the 
16 bit version, and the PCPWAT version.  They don't seem to work, as they 
are both missing something.

Also, is there a way to put more documentation into the program, for the 
installation procedures??  There is a skimpy amount, and since I have no 
where else to turn, I am writing to you for help.

Thanks

Joseph Hogan

Just what it says. You've toyed around with the setup and now it's broken.
Say:

	M(ain)
	S(etup)
	C(onfig)

and clear the field for "initial keystroke". If you can't do that, edit the
file .pinerc, e.g. by saying:

	joe ~/.pinerc

and clear the respective line.

Subject: PINE and FIND command (IMAP)
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


Hi, I've looked in the archives but couldn't spot an answer to this problem.

I'm using PINE 3.96 to connect to an IMAP4 server and am having difficulty
with listing mailboxes.  PINE is using the FIND command which is marked as
obsolete in RFC 1730, and our server doesn't support it.  Is there a way to
persuade PINE to use the LIST command instead?

Cheers,
Andrew

When I dial in to our unix mail server and start pine, it does something
which reverses the video colors (changes the black on white to white on
black).  It doesn't get reset after I leave Pine.

Is there a simple way I can get Pine to leave the video mode to black text
on a white background.  Our system admin suggested to use setterm=vt100,
but that didn't change anything.  I am not a unix nor a pine guru.  If
you can help me, thanks!

Everyone's more than welcome to ask question here, that's what the list is
for :-)

  >Is there any way to know if a message has been read by the receiver?

No. It is not even possible to tell if the mail has been received. Compare
the situation to a regular postal system: You post a letter, but unless
you've taken certain steps, you cannot be sure that it has reached its
addressee.

And to answer the next question... :-) Yes, there are certain steps you can
take to make sure your mail has reached its addressee. However, those
involve certain software on behalf of both parties. Here on my system, I'm
running procmail. There are a few people that depend on their mails reaching
me, so I've set up an auto-acknowledging system for them. This system can be
turned on and off via email, either by myself or by them if they feel this
step unnecessary. But, as I said, the other party has to take similar steps,
too. From my experience, it's enough to be notified that a mail could *not*
be delivered (you normally get a message from your ISP after 5 hours and
then again after some days).

Hope that helps.

Robin

Alas, no... not until Pine 4.00 --which we hope isn't *too* far off.

I am seeing it right now (with 3.96). All I am doing it loading up a
newsgroup with some 10,000 articles unread, and just pushing the space bar
to go the next page (my page length is abour 45 lines or so). First page
display is fast, and just after (probably) second page, things slow down a 
lot. All I am trying it to lookup the header, and then probably read a few
of the articles.
 
I use TIN more frequently than pine to read news ((for multiple reasons).
And I have *never* seen any such delays. So I will rule our the server 
immediately. Now that leaves the client. So I will try to look at the code.
(Or probably some developer would have noticed ?)

Who gets to kill him first?  Granted, it would be much more fun if we
didn't have to take turns...

It is nice to notice, however, that the AOL stereotype shows no sign
of becoming obsolete any time in the near future.

As an alternative to this approach, I have a way of incorporating
PGP with Pine.  See my web page at this URL:

We could draw straws!  But I'm with you, I'd rather not have to wait in 
line.  Anyone else got a better suggestion?

Subject: PC-Pine for windows form-feed between agregate messages
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Hi - after spending a couple hours on trying to solve a problem which
I'm certain other people have, I'm still at a loss.

I'm trying to print messages from PC-Pine for windows to a local
printer with formfeeds between messages.  When I do this, no formfeeds
are printed but rather some funny looking control characters.  This
has happened with both an epson L1000 printer and a laserjet 2p
printer.  

I have the following switches set in config:

            [X]  print-offers-custom-cmd-prompt  
                     (seems only applicable to unix version)

            [X]  print-includes-from-line
            [X]  print-formfeed-between-messages
	        
Alas, doesn't seem to work.  Anyone have any advice?  It seems that
whatever control code PC-Pine is using as a formfeed isn't recoginized
by the windows print driver.  I might try going to the generic text
only printer driver in windows but if I do this I lose the true-type
fonts I believe....

Any help would be greatly appreciated. 

Sincerely, Steve Zelazny

Simple, you need to either
   1) convince pine to use curses
or 2) install libtermcap.

for (2) it'll be at your favorite sunsite or gnu archive called
termcap-1.3.tar.gz (or later) and you'll need to make sure you've
got an /etc/termcap file.

(Ultra Q&D is a link from libncurses* to libtermcap* in /usr/lib, but
 it only sometimes works...)

Today I tried using the Pine "suspend" command (Control Z).  It worked,
kinda ... I couldn't figure out hwo to "un-suspend" the process and get
back into Pine.  I when I tried "exit" I got a message that there were no
suspended jobs; when I tried getting back into Pine I was told that it was
already running.

Could someone please let me know by direct mail (as I don't read the
newsgroup) how to correct whatever I did.

thanks.

Well whenever we suspend  our (Silicon Graphics) copy of Pine it actually
*tells* you how to get back into it:

	Pine suspended. Give the "fg" command to come back.
	Warning: Your IMAP connection will be closed if Pine
	is suspended for more than 30 minutes

	Suspended (signal)

Didn't yours?

The "suspend" feature is not unique to Pine, but is commonly implemented
in many UNIX programs.  The feature is usually called "job control", and
is documented in the on-line manual page for the shell.

Perhaps it might be worth starting to read it?  Or at least have the
courtesy to check it for a few days looking for the answer to your query?
(After all it is a (two-way) discussion forum, not really an information
service.  :-)

    Conversion may not be needed.  In all the time between versions
3.91 and 3.96, I do not recall anything like this happening to me. 
However, in 3.96 you can control the layout of the index listing.  Go
into your configuration and read the online help for the field
index-format.  Since this is merely a configuration option for how the
display looks, you could play around with it a little to see if that
makes any difference.  If it doesn't work, just put it back the way it
was before you started and you have not lost anything.  Good luck.

Hi!

First of all I want to say that I LOVE PINE and sing it's praises to
everyone.  You have really come up with a wonderful email system that's
easy to use.  I wish everyone used it.

QUESTION:  How do I get my "saved-messages" folder and "sent-mail" folders
to show up at the beginning of the folder list along with the INBOX?  I
have looked through the configuration (Pine 3.95) and can't figure out
how to fix this.  I have a long 4-column list and saved-messages and 
sent-mail are way down in the s's.  Please help.  Thanks.

If you neither want to study any webpages nor install any additional

display-filters=

Wrong newsgroup, Madam... Apart from that, there are some tools that can
help you to "get" (I presume you mean "decode") base64'ed messages. Check

	<a href="http:www.yahoo.com>ME TOO!!!</a>

for further information. There's a search engine that will help you to find
what you need.

I am not sure what is going on with our system, but my friends who use
american online can send me mail, but the letter is not attached.  For
example, their address and subject can be read, but nothing else.  Their
letter seems blank is there something wrong with our system.

Lately whenever I look at my mail in Pine, no messages at all from any
previous time that I had opened Pine remain in my INBOX, MAIL, or NEWMAIL
folders.  That is to say, I can look at my mail (even just the lists or
indexes of messages), quit without deleting anything or even 
transfer read mail to the MAIL folder, then go back in to Pine and not a
single message from the previous pass remains.

I also have two NEWMAIL (second in lower case) folders that bring in all
new messages in duplicate into two separate but identical/parallel folders
which used to fill up my mailbox (doubling the amount of used up disk
quota space) at an alarming rate.  Often now my INBOX and MAIL folders are
empty when I open or re-open Pine.  At such times, the folder list shows
NO NEWMAIL folders at all.  Is it possible that this old troublesome bug
is causing my new, even more bothersome bug?

Please help.  Looking at all the help screens didn't do anything.  Thank
you!

Subject: incoming folders & replying
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

All,

	I'm trying to set pine with different incoming folders, as
procmail distributes the messages to diffente folders.

	To do so, I've created a folder named inbox where procmail puts
everything, and then I edited .pinerc and put the following:

incoming-folders=sf-lit     inbox/sf-lit,
                 culture    inbox/culture,
                 cnet       inbox/cnet,
                 inbox-read inbox/inbox-read,
                 nt-sec     inbox/nt-sec,
                 pine       inbox/pine-info,
 
	This works fine, however when I'm the last message of one of the
folders and I tell pine to go to the next folder he says "no more incoming
folders" and stays in INBOX.

	Does anyone know how to make this work? Also, If there's a way to
make all the folders in a directory show up without having to specify them
individually, I'd be glad to know it!

	The other thing I'm trying to set up is that when replying to a
message with different "from", "reply-to", "reply", pine showed a menu and
I had to choose which one of the addresses I want to reply to. I've seen
this work, but I don't know what setting I have to change.

	Thanks for your help!

Subject: pine patch with nice PGP hooks?
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

the tin newsreader has an excellent built in ability to sign or encrypt messages before sending them off, by
hitting a single key.. it then invokes unix pgp which prompts you for your password. Has anyone created a
patch for this, where can I get it now and will it be included in the next pine release?

Subject: Mouse support in Pine 3.95 in an Xterm 
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-To: pine-info@cac.washington.edu
X-No-Archive: Yes
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

I am using Pine 3.95 on Solaris 2.5 in an Xterm window.
I am using 'vim' editor as my alternate editor all the time.

Problem:
 Whenever I first launch up Pine with all the mouse features enabled, it works
fine and recognizes my mouse clicks and takes the appropriate action. 

	Now when I compose a new mail or a reply, an action which fires up my
alternate editor, this editor is also mouse-aware. It interprets my mouse
clicks and does with it whatever it is designed to do. 

	When I exit the editor and send the reply/mail and go back to the main
Index window, or any other Pine screen, my mouse clicks are totally ignored.
Pine seems to have lost control of the mouse!

	When I now exit Pine and launch it again, the whole scenario is
repeated. i.e. it initially is mouse-aware, but as soon as I launch a editor
that is also mouse-aware, Pine loses the battle!

	I use the 'slrn' newsreader with 'vim' , both of which are mouse-aware
programs and I dont have this problem there! Looks like something peculiar to
Pine 3.95.

	Please look into it and let me know what can be done.

Thanks,
--Vikas

Return-Receipt-To: _your_email_address_

Whether or not you get a receipt back has nothing to do with Pine.  It
depends on whether the receiving (other) system honors the request or
not.  Some do, many do not.  There is nothing, really, that you can do
about it, as there is no way to force it.  And a return receipt only
means that the mail was delivered.  It says nothing about whether the
intended recipient has actually read the mail -- or even discarded it
unread, for that matter.

Pine does not get mail one user at all, it only sends mail.

All others users it works fine.

It wont even get undeliver mail back to that user , and

mail, but Pine does not find that it only show INBOX 0 messages?

Can anyone help me with this problem?

What is the format for the header line requesting return recipt?

Does pine send a return recipt when this header is in the header?

Hello ppl...

I have a question... Will the next version of PINE have better support for POP3?

Right now to check my mail I have to boot windows and use Eudora...

I don't like X so I can't use Netscape's mail...

One last thing.. When will the next version be out?

Thx..

Geez, I haven't been around in a while. I don't think I understand what you're
asking, Robin? Do you mean as in export a message, then when it asks for the
file name, type 'strg+v'? I just tried it in 3.95, and it seems to work ok.

Have a look in the (S)etup, (C)onfig menu for the initial keystrokes list. If
you don't expect it to contain anything, then make sure it is empty. If you
*do* expect it to contain items, make sure you add them using the (A)dd item
selection. Check the context sensitive help, (?), for information on how it
should be formatted.

If this isn't the problem, then possibly "pine" at your command prompt has
been aliased incorrectly? Type 'which pine' to find out. The response will
tell you if it's been aliased, and to what.

my school's server does not support pine, but i've been using 3.96 from 
my own account.  recently UMR did some kind of HP upgrade which 
apparently disabled pine's inbox.  they recommended we change it to 10.2 
architecture, but it won't go above 8.0.  in a fit of helplessness, our 
sysadmins had no other recommendations.  i'd appreciate any suggestions 
you guys have.  thanks.

I've just started using Procmail with Pine and have run into an annoying
problem.  After I receive new mail and start up pine, I go into one of
the mailing list folders where there may be 40 or so messages and the
last one at the bottom is always the one selected to be read.  How can I
get it to start at the 1st message in the folder?

Thanks for any info.
Jason

It sounds more like your inbox may live in a different directory now...

OR

Have your sysadmins pick up the binary or source and re-install it for
you.

Pretty lame on their part...

Change the mail sort order from the Main - Setup - Config menu???  I think
this will fix it.

Hi

I am using Pine 3.91 for Unix via Kermit 3.11. Is there anyway I can 
block out notorious spammers like cyberpromo? If not, is there some 
software which will work?

I use Pine with a pop3 account just fine. In the .pinerc file simply put
a /pop3 after the name of the server in the 'inbox' field. For instance,
if your inbox line says:

{mail.server.net}inbox

change it to:

{mail.server.net/pop3}inbox

Hope that this helps...

X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


This message is being sent to this mailing list weekly in order to
aid readers in finding information about Pine.  Before sending questions 
to the mailing list -- which is mirrored in the newsgroup comp.mail.pine --
please consult these resources:

The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
help.  Additional information, including a User's Guide, Technical Notes, 
Questions & Answers, where to obtain the Pine software, what tools are 
available to perform tasks that Pine itself does not, and more, can be 
accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.

     - The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
       also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection
       (from Pine's MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to
       folder-collections and choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/docs/[]
    

The messages from this mailing list/newsgroup are archived.  These archives
can be accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/
       (includes a searchable index of all archived messages, and information
        on how to subscribe to this mailing list)

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/pine-info/.

     - From within Pine by defining a folder collection (from Pine's MAIN
       MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to folder-collections and 
       choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/pine-info/[]

If you have a question about Pine, chances are it has been asked before
and you can find the answer either through the searchable index of past
messages, or among the "Questions & Answers" at the URL: 

http://www.washington.edu/pine/QandA/ 
  or
ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs/QandA.txt

If you need personal assistance with using or configuring Pine, contact
the technical support staff or computer help desk of your Internet Service
Provider, school, university, employer, ... -- whichever organization
provided you with the email account on which you are using, or planning on
using, Pine.  Because system functions and configuration can vary from
site to site, they are best qualified to assist you.  (Due to the large
number of Pine installations worldwide, the University of Washington
cannot provide individual support services to Pine users at other
organizations.)

I got the impression the 3.96 version of PC pine was going to support
POP3 mailservers. Anyone know if this is in fact the case?

    In general, no.  Sorry.  Some proprietary mail systems can provide
a receipt indicating that a mail message has been opened, but such
systems are just that -- proprietary and private.  There is no standard
on the Internet as a whole providing for what you want.  Mail systems
on the Internet are so diverse that I expect it would be technically
difficult to implement such a standard.  In Pine (and other mailers),
you can create a Return-receipt-to: header requesting a delivery
receipt, but there is no way to force the receiving system to honor it. 
Some do, but many do not.  And even if you get such a receipt back, it
only indicates that the mail has been delivered, not that it has been
read.

Does anyone know how to restrict the number of indices in a news
group retrieved in Pine? For example, is it possible to tell Pine only to
retrieve most recently posted 50 iterms in a news group?

Thanks for your help in advance!

Sorry, no.  And even though 4.00 will have the POP driver included, it
still will not offer *offline* support.  That is, it requires that you
remain connected while you process mail --just as unix Pine with the POP
driver enabled does.

Simple question ...

Can pine compose a message containing a correct message/external-body 
component ?

I can add a broken section using the mime.types file but I can't see
any way to convince pine to do it right ... I'm using pine 3.95q on
Linux.

If you find this not only annoying but also a very illegal use of the 
Internet, forward a copy to postmaster@erols.com and any other addresses, 
like sysop@erols.com and ask them to put a stop to it.  I already have.  
So far it hasn't bounced back, so I hope the address is valid.

I have been telnetting into my account at school from home over the
summer.  My friends and I all write from our accounts at school so you
would think that there would not be a problem getting eamil through the
system, howeve, lately I have not been receiving email from people that
they have sent to me.  I have even tried writing a message to myself and
sending it and I didn't receive it.  They have also not been receiving
some of my email.  The thing that is really confusing me is that out of
every 4 letter I usually get one and for every three or four that I write,
one or two go through.  Do you have any suggestions.  Of course I don't
even know if you will get this message or if I will receive your reaponse.
Please try though, I really won't be able to live without my email.  Thank
you.

Simple. Create a file in your home directory, called .forward, which contains
the address where you want your mail forwarded.

Subject: Q: PINE and USENET News Overview database
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Is it possible that pine would use 
overview database to access newsgroup
articles? This is much faster open one file
.overview than several files (sometimes
thousands of them), especially localy.
In the remote access this could be also better.

Best regards,

Amy, the problem most likely isn't in pine itself, but in the mailer
configuration on the system you're using.  You should talk to the
administrators of the system (probably root@wam.umd.edu) to see if they
can track down specific messages to see where they went.  It would
probably help them if you could give exact details about which messages
you havn't received (i.e. From who and when)...

Hope this helps,
	Rick

Ok guys and gals, what's the secret to printing out a file?  I can either
print out my entire "inbox" of messages or I can "print-screen."  What the
magic? This is the 21st Century.

I just installed pine on a new AIX box where it's sole purpose will be for
dumb terminal email and no shell access. Is it possible (without
re-compiling) to take out the <SETUP> --> <N-ewPassword> feature so my
users cannot chanage their password? Should I just install an older
version that does not have this capability? 

Thanks!

Suggestion for future upgrades:

When I reply to a message from someone whose e-mail ID is in my addresslist,
it would be nice if the Fcc were automatically changed to the one in my
addressfile rather than the default.  Is there a way to accomplish this now? 
As it is, I have to change it by hand or replace the To line with the one in
my addressbook.

Hi,
  I am using Pine 3.94. Is there a way to tell Pine to mark old messages
with an O like elm does it instead of a N?

Thanks in advance 
Schreini

I've got a client running 3.89 Pine on a Solaris 2.4 system.  The
'Mailbox is READONLY' problem just occurred system-wide.  It was
solved with a reboot but what mystifies the client - and what I
hoped someone on the list could explain to me - is why that
problem would happen to everyone on site?  Is there something
unique to Solaris that causes Pine to think *everyone* has a
duplicate session running?

for every one individual that gets pissed off just because he or she thinks
someone has invaded their sorry ass little private space with bulk e-mail,
theres hundreds who like to get new info over their computers. its very
little trouble to delete an unwanted e-mail anyway, so i don't understand
what the big deal is!! whats next, not allowing direct mail through postage
just because you don't want to walk over to the trash can to throw it away!!
making telemarketing legal because you don't have the balls to tell the
person on the other end your not interested!!! this is american free
enterprise and there are many businesses and people who rely on this type of
advertising to make a living! i'm not one of them, but i don't mind deleting
an unwanted e-mail every now and then. who knows, one of them might interest
me someday. this is the 90's. if you  don't like free enterprise then build a
log cabin in the woods and fish for food.

This problem is well known :-) Only plain ascii is allowed in the
header of emails, but what you get is iso-8859-1, because you're
friend is using Spanish. There is a workaround with procmail, but
generally, it'd be better if your friend stuck to the conventions,
i.e. he didn't use diacritics in the headers of his emails.

If you like, you can put the following into your .procmailrc:

     -------------8<--------- snip here -----8<------------------
:0 fh
* =\?ISO-8859-[0-9]+\?Q\?
|perl -pe 's#=\?ISO-8859-\d+\?Q\?(.*?)\?=#$s=$1;
$s=~s/\s+(\r?\n)/$1/g;'\
-e '$s=~s/=\r?\n//g; $s=~s/=([\da-fA-F]{2})/pack("C", hex($1))/ge;'\
-e '$s#ge;'

This is the second time that I have had an account that utilized pine. The
first time was when I attended the Univ. of Washington. Initially, my
newsgroup postings worked like everyone else's. By this I mean that my
name appeared in the name collumn identifying me as the sender of the
message on the newsgroups list of messages. Just before I left the U, my
postings began to show either a) the name of the newsgoup ex: To:
alt.politics.britain or b) the name of the party to whom I was responding
ex: To: Jim Smith, in this collumn. This varies with whether I choose to
respond to the original party via email or just post to the group. The
situation is now repeating itself with my current account. Does this sound
familiar to anyone? Is their a way I can fix it?

				Thanks,
					Kevin McCabe

Yep. Quite Easy: stop posting to alt.politics.britain and responding
to Jim Smith. I mean, isn't a.p.b. something like alt.italian.heroes?

Otherwise, keep reading this newsgroup, because the same question will 
come up at least twice a week and maybe someday you'll understand that 
(as the faq says) this is the wanted behaviour. Ever considered using
Gnus? Hehehe >:->

Hey, complaint@aol.com, these pricks are GETTING ON MY NERVES! This is 
the umptheenth time I've posted a complaint to you. So here's the
deal: I got this nice 100 Mbit line at my disposal. How about me
mailbombing a couple of your "customers"? Either respond with a sound
explanation of why you let them use university resources for this
bullshit or get ready for some serious complaints. K?

"Think"? Now where did MrPayback get that word from?

MrPayback> someone has invaded their sorry ass little private space
MrPayback> with bulk e-mail, theres hundreds who like to get new info
MrPayback> over their computers.

Info? What info? On which "my computer"? You're sucking up university
resources, you little twit.

MrPayback> its very little trouble to delete an unwanted e-mail
MrPayback> anyway, so i don't understand what the big deal is!!

Am I getting something wrong or did he just ask for some kernel
sources in handy chunks? Say, like 1k or something?

MrPayback> whats next, not allowing direct mail through postage just
MrPayback> because you don't want to walk over to the trash can to
MrPayback> throw it away!!  

*argl* How stupid can one get? Unsollicited commercial mail is as
illegal as UC faxes... and email is considered to be the same. What
MrPayback is doing is illegal.

MrPayback> making telemarketing legal because you don't have the balls
MrPayback> to tell the person on the other end your not interested!!!

Man, are you wrong... I'd beat the living crap out of you if you had
the guts to show up here... But you don't.


MrPayback> this is american free enterprise and there are many
MrPayback> businesses and people who rely on this type of advertising
MrPayback> to make a living! 

Duhhh... What the heck do I care about some lackwit doing "american
free enterprise"? You we do "German slavery" here...

MrPayback> i'm not one of them, but i don't mind deleting an unwanted
MrPayback> e-mail every now and then. who knows, one of them might
MrPayback> interest me someday. 

Ok, see if you like X-sources... Reading them can be quite refreshing...

MrPayback> this is the 90's. 

Attention all readers, here comes the philosophical part...

MrPayback> if you don't like free enterprise then build a log cabin in
MrPayback> the woods and fish for food.

Yep, that's just what I was planning on doing...

Anyone ever got a reply from abuse@aol.com? Not me --- wonder why?

Later,

Hi All -

  I'm running Red Hat Linux on my system at home in a network with
half a dozen other machines.  All of the machines on my net have
hostnames and share the same bogus domain name and have host numbers
from the reserved 192.168.* block of addresses.  The machine that
I use for email has it's hostname on my internal network, but all
mail goes thru an interface with a name assigned by my ISP.

  I've been using this setup with MH-E for years.  Although my
hostname is patently bogus, I use mtstailor to configure the public
name of my system (kukla.tiac.net).

  What has this to do with Pine?  I have a novice user who is starting
to use my system and rather than drag him through the rigors of MH or
MH-E, we've set up Pine.  I can configure Pine to rewrite the hostname
in the From: header, but there is telltale cruft in the Message-ID and
Pine adds a bogus X-Sender: header.  I have a legitimate reason for
not disclosing the hostname I use for my machine on my private net.

  I've been all over the docs for how to fix this by way of the
standard configuration variables and have had no luck.  Am I missing
something?

  If there is no way to deal with this straight up, has anyone
published patches for the Pine 3.95 sources to give me a "total
cloaking" option?

Thanks,
chasb

I am working away from my UNIX box for a time and would like to forward
all my mail to another address.  I thought this was possible with a
.forward file that I thought I used in college (several years ago) but
now I can't figure out how I did it.

Thanks,

Hilary Whitehead

Hello,
 Is it possible for Pine to generate emails in text/enriched MIME format? I
know that Pine can 'read' such a mail provided it has the Content-type:
text/enriched.

For example, I typed something like.. This is a <bold> BOLD </bold> word
and mailed it to myself, but Pine just displayed the text as is.

How about it?

Thanks,
Vikas

Hello!

I am trying to correspond with a friend in the US using Swedish
characters. I use IE 3.02 and my friend is using Pine (PC?) in version
x.xx (clue, friend at berkeley).
My Swedish characters o-with dots and so on come across as 
K and so on.
What should I send to get proper Swedish characters in the other end.
Is there a font missing and could i write an installation program that
installs it?
Anybody who knows the answer to this one.

Jonas

: Can anybody suggest what I might have done wrong? Incidently, I don't want to use Pico for my message editing anyhow. I'm much happier with vi. I've yet to find a version of vi (or vim, really) for OS/2, though, except for one which only seems to work in full-screen mode.


The Pine-OS2 archive should contain the following .dll's:

c-client.dll
emx.dll
emxlibcs.dll
picolib.dll

I forget off of the top of my head how, exactly, the install program works,
but if you make sure that those .dll's are in a directory that is listed in
the 'LIBPATH=' statement in OS/2's config.sys, or make sure that those files
are in the same directory that you run Pine from, you'll be good to go.

If you don't have those files, you can get another copy of Pine-OS2 that
does contain them at:

Simply put the .forward file in your home directory with the entry
for your "new" e-mail address in the file... Easy, eh?

Hiya
Is there a way to move from the index screen to the folders screen with
out going all the way to the main menu. I've already read the help
resourses I can find and couldn't find the answer.

		Be well and happy

See

It should apply against 3.95 vanilla as well.

Just got through with a heated argument with a coworker (who's
normally fairly reasonable) regarding HTML in email. He thinks it's
just so wonderful; that HTML is an added capability, and if you don't
like it, don't use it. The following arguments failed to sway him:

1) I don't have a choice when some nit uses HTML on a mailing list
2) Exactly how much HTML are we going to support? The 3.2 standard?
Whose?
3) Who the HELL wants frames and midi in their email?
4) ASCII has been fine for over 35 years. Why the sudden interest in
colored text?
5) ALL business correspondence remains black print on a white
background. What do we know that the most powerful men in the country
don't?
6) If you can't say it in ASCII, why do I care that your mail has
wallpaper?

Thoughts?

Hi

Even though I keep deleting this message I keep getting it when I use

<MAILER-DAEMON@woi-gw.attitude.com> Subject: DON'T DELETE THIS MESSAGE --
FOLDER INTERNAL DATA

This text is part of the internal format of your mail folder, and is not
a real message.  It is created automatically by the mail system software.
If deleted, important folder data will be lost, and it will be re-created
with the data reset to initial values. ----------- However, when I am on
my Win95 Workstation and request for my email using Internet Mail and
News it does not get downloaded.

Does anyone know how to stop getting this message?

Complete nonsense. Period. Either you want so send emails, then you
can use ascii. Or you want to send something KeWL. Then you'd be
better off using Netrape or Internet Exploder. BTW, this is a faq.

Thank you very much. However this explains how to goto a specific folder.
I need to get to the list. Is that possible.

No. By default, pine is set to us-ascii, which is a Good Thing [TM],
because it's the lowest common denominator. Now, I'm not sure what
exactly Internet Exploder does, but I know what the other MS programs
do, and from what I've seen, I'm pretty sure you're not producing
high-ascii (iso-latin-?) but something entirely different, probably
rtf.

Now, you could either drop those diacritics ("we" say ae instead of d
[which you're probably not seeing right now, either]) or use TeX code, 
i.e. \"a which certain u*ix newsreaders can translate. <*hint*> This
would be a nice feature for pine, too... </*hint*>.

Otherwise, you'll have to attach a file format your friend can read
(html would be one that can be read with pine for u*ix, though it
requires an external viewer).

In short: If you're not using English, you're doomed >;->

Robin

Subject: Pine and D410-DG emulation
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Hi! I've just compiled Pine 3.96 (on a DG/UX) and could only make it run on
a VT terminal emulation.   The major application that's running on this
unix machine runs on
a D410-DG emulation, so I was hoping that there's a way for me to run Pine
with the same D410 emulation.
 
Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

That's:

Of course, you don't have to say o first, it works like that alright.

X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


Hi,

I am running pine 3.95q on a Sparc 2 running Solaris.

I recently starting having problems accessing my mail via pine.
When first starting pine, I would get the error that the mail
file is in the wrong format.  When I specify the inbox path,
I can open one very large message read-only that contains all of
the mail messages.

I have no problems looking at the file in unix mail, elm, or
an X mail tool that came with CDE.

Has anyone experienced problems like this before?  I'm really frustrated
because nothing has changed in the system.

Another variable to mention, I use a perl script called 'unixpop' to
move mail from a remote machine to my local machine.  It was working fine
before with pine, so although it is suspicious, it doesn't make sense.

Thanks in advance for any help,
Anna Winkler

Ok, ok, I herewith humbly withdraw anything bad I ever said about aol
users. It was a blatant understatement.

You don't "dial into Pine". If anything, you connect to your ISP and
login to the remote system. You don't download messages, either. What
you're looking for is probably mail-retrieval and forwarding utility;
one that fetches mail from remote mailservers and  forwards  it  to
your  local  (client)  machine's delivery system. One with which you
can then handle the retrieved  mail  using  normal  mail  user
agents  such  as pine. Well, I guess you're shpxrq big time because
these things only exist in the grown-ups' world...

The best thing for you to do is go to your local toystore and get the
latest release of Netcrap. Call the 1-900 support hotline and ask them
which icon you have to do the clicky-clicky thing with to get the mail
from the remote host. Don't bother putting your real name, your
organization or a signature in the preferences thing, because they're
really not necessary.

*yawn*

I am wondering if anyone can tell me if it is possible to read sent-mail in
PC Pine.
Specifically, I save portions of large files from my unix account sent-mail,
I save the entire sent-mail file from /usr/mail/sent-mail to my local PC as
plain text.
What I want is to be able to use PC pine strictly to open those saved
sent-mail files
and utilise the pine indexing feature since I periodically re-post messages
in those files.
I tried that and no matter what I did, pine kept telling me there was an
error, staring with opening the program I get; No inbox! Folder to open as
inbox:

No matter what I selected, or renamed that sent-mail file as, (sent,
sentmail, inbox
etc)
Id then get a message; "preserve folder as "inbox-path" in PINERC?" yes or
no made no difference, I would still get; "mail folder closed due to access
error"
Selecting the folder name from the list shows; "Folder SENT-MAIL opened with
0 messages"

ALL I want to do is read the files as sent mail and use the index as I do in
unix on line, then copy/paste that text into my on-line pine for posting.
Any ideas?
I am using the windows version of PC pine 3.96, the two sent-mail files I
tried are
300k and 500k in size downloaded ftp from my mail file.

X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


After probing further, I realized that
the confusion and subsequent freeze of pine
was due to the fact that I had a shell wrap
around (for purpose of usage tracking since 
we were testing it) and that shell somehow 
owned by uid 1 and that was confusing things ....

So, never mind ...

If he's got a responsible mailer, it'll send an sugar-coated HTMLised

through lynx, anyways.

HTML 2.0, I think, doesn't support frames? _GOOD_

A thought is if you're using netscape mail, use netscape's html
extensions, and so-forth.

Not me, but It'd be fun to fiddle with, though I'm more interested in
pictures and forms.

Nothin, they've got work to do, but I've got a little time to stuff
around, so, if it looks nicer, why can't I do it? *shrug*

>6) If you can't say it in ASCII, why do I care that your mail has

Then again, if it is a serious email, it's too much bother to do anything
fancy, but sending a birthday e-mail would be the perfect time to add a
little color and noise.

I just Bcc the mail to myself, that works. I suppose you could fake
something like that, but you'd need to have root access to the mail host
to add records of the mail passing through too.

Hi,

	I'm trying to set the /etc/mailcap so when I have an HTML
attachment, pine launches lynx.

	The only thing I've managed to get is to lauch lynx in the
background, without actually seeing anything and having to kill the
process.

	Can anyone help me? Thanks in advance.

	FYI: Linux 2.0.30, Pine 3.96

Subject: Pine 3.95: Generating text/enriched ?
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Hello,
 Is it possible for Pine to generate emails in text/enriched MIME format? I
know that Pine can 'read' such a mail provided it has the Content-type:
text/enriched.

For example, I typed something like.. This is a <bold> BOLD </bold> word
and mailed it to myself, but Pine just displayed the text as is.

How about it?

Thanks,
Vikas

I guess with my current setup with a customized From line that pine
that the FROMTO field will never be able to figure out that I send
the message and that it should show the To: field.  I have set
the From field to gehinjc@ornl.gov whereas my real address on the 
machine which I run pine is gnv@nasrp2.cped.ornl.gov.

Perhaps I should just leave the From line alone and only set

First, you'll have to post what the message is, exactly. Only then can someone
try and help.

In this case, it's important for us to know from where you use Pine, and on
which platform. For example, are you trying to print from Pine, while you're
at school, on a school printer, (your school's help desk should be able to
help here), or are you phoning in to the school system, (which terminal
program, settings, etc?), and starting Pine remotely, or are you using Pine
from home, (once again, which platform, etc)?

I wonder is Gerard and his off-topic ilk are Y2k compliant.  I would
gladly endure 2.5 more years of this crap if it meant that S/N would
skyrocket on 1/1/2000.

    In your personal configuration, you may set the domain name (after
the '@') that will go out on your mail and news postings.  However, as
Pine comes out of the box, you may NOT change your userid (before the
'@').  This is deliberate.  However, Pine may be recompiled with a
switch set in one of the header files to allow changing all of the
From: header.  Many installations do not allow this, as they consider
it a security liability.  Talk to your help desk or system
administrator.  Without modification, "vanilla" Pine is purposely
designed to forbid what you want to do.

In Pine 3.95, I noticed that after saving a message to a folder and then
sending a reply, the "answered" flag isn't set. Is this normal behavior?

Start pine and choose setup->config. Enable "enable-full-header-cmd"
and press 'h' to toggle on/off the display of full headers-

Subject: NT Pine and reading Unix mail spool files. [Semi-Repost]
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Howdy again,

I have obtained the version of Pine for Windows NT - yet that version of
Pine requires IMAP (And/or POP? Doesn't matter.). As we don't currently
have an IMAP server (nor a POP server for that matter.) and we are not
planning to use IMAP in the forseeable future (We'll be moving to One
Time password cards soon, so that would make POP nearly useless (Having
to type the keycode every 5 minutes isn't very useful.), and we don't want
to run an IMAP server until all the security implications are resolved.).

We have thought about cross mounting the Unix mail directory over a Samba
share and having pine read M:\[username] (Or whatever, you ofcourse get my
point.) as a unix mailfile.

However, I have yet to discover the option to let Pine for NT accept
'M:\[username]' as an INBOX, as it requires an IMAP folder as that
parameter.

I have a hard time to believe that whoever developed Pine and ported it
to NT disabled the rather useful future that is used heavily in Unix
machines.

So in short - this is my question : Is there a way to scratch IMAP support
and use simple files as folders? Don't tell me that's impossible, it
simply doesn't make sense.

I have reviewed the FAQ's and found no evidence for an answer, if it is
written in one somewhere, I'd appreciate a pointer to it.

Thanks in Advance,
Nir
CS Institute, HUJI

What do you mean? A list of examples of what you've tried, and what turns up
might be in order here. Create a default pine.conf.fixed, using the command
pine -conf >/local/etc/pine.conf.fixed, (use whatever path is appropriate for
your system, of course), and put the values into that.

     I'm one of the world wide users of Pine at Chulalongkorn University
in Bangkok, Thailand.I don't understand why everytime I open Pine and
there's a massage at the bottom of the page said `the return add. maybe
incorrect'or something like that.I also wondering why there is so much that I
don't know about Pine, such as I don't know what to do more than read and
compose massages and use address book while I think there is a lot more
than these simple things, like something more advance.  Could you give me
any suggestion whare I can get some information that I can use to learn to
`get the most out of Pine' 'cause those massage in the ?HELP is quite
difficult.  Thank you.

Pine provides two systemwide configuration files:

	pine.conf
	pine.conf.fixed

Whenever any one starts Pine it configures itself by reading these, the
user's own .pinerc file, and any command line options.

Entries in the pine.conf file are merely defaults; a user can change or
override them in their own settings file or on the command line.

Entries in the pine.conf.fixed file cannot be changed in this way however.
If you want to remove the ability to alter a variable's value (such as
those associated with printing) set them in the pine.conf.fixed file (we
usually set them in pine.conf, and then merely copy the relevant lines
acrosds to pine.conf.fixed for any we want to "fix").

You can remove access to the Setup command by including the following
feature-list item in the relevant systemwide configuration file:

	disable-config-cmd

There are some other commands like this you might find useful too:

	disable-default-in-bug-report
	disable-keyboard-lock-cmd
	disable-password-cmd
	disable-update-cmd
	disable-signature-edit-cmd

Cheers,

    Once again, Pine has nothing to do with return receipts in any way,
size, shape, or form other than allowing you to request one on what you
send out.  Your questions have to do with mail delivery, but PINE has
nothing to do with mail delivery.  If someone else sends you email with
a return receipt requested, whether that sender will in fact get a
return receipt depends on how the mail delivery agent is configured on
your system -- and Pine is NOT that mail delivery agent.  (Pine is a
mail USER agent.)

    And in any case, almost no mail systems hooked into the Internet
provide receipts that actually tell the sender that the mail has been
opened and read.  About all a return receipt says is that the mail has
been delivered to the addressee -- not what the addressee might have
done with it.  Pine is only one part of the total email process, and a
relatively passive part at that.

Subject: rlogin access to mail server
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


Hello,

is it possible to have an rlogin access to a mail server instead of
using telnet? I have different user names on the two systems and
always have to insert LOGIN and PASSWORD which is pretty annoying :-/

I think, I've had that problem once and succeeded in solving it doing
some minor tricks within the .rhost tables ... but I don't know
anymore. Also, this time I've different user names on both systems
which is the main problem up to my knowledge.

Any clues? Many thanks for all suggestions!

{}s, Norbert

The "undisclosed.recipients" problem is a bug in Pine 3.93.  The current
version is 3.96.  If possible, try upgrading.  I've also heard a few
horror stories about run-away processes and coredumps using cmail so that
could be the problem too.  Good luck!

Does anyone have an idea on how to have Pine automatically attach a
specific file everytime a composition is done?

I've looked around all the options and such and don't see anything likely.
So any help in this area would be, well, helpful ;)

Subject: don't want to save attachments
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Hello,

I have switched from Elm to Pine some two weeks ago and I am quite
satisfied. There is, however, something that seems quite logical to have,
but seems not to exist.

  When I include attachments to a message, it is often the case that I do
  not want to keep the attachments in the File Carbon Copy (Fcc) folder. Just 
  to save the main body of the message and _references_ to the files attached
  seems more logical, as the files attached are already available elsewhere
  in the file system.

  It is neither possible to enter the folder of the FCC and delete the
  attachments without deleting the main body.

The only possibility that I know of, is to use good old "mailx" which
allows me to edit individual messages in a folder (with my favorite editor
"vi") and save the edited message back into the folder.

Is there a solution to my problem within Pine? Please react by email by
preference and I will summarize to the newsgroup if there is any interest.

I don't quite get what you mean by viewer, but if you're referring to
lines being wrapped because they're too long, try kicking these people 
because the haven't set their line-widths correctly. There's no "text
viewer" that could do that. However, you could start using a mailer
that supports proportional fonts. Like MS Internet Exploder.
Just kidding.

    If the message has already been saved in a folder (or is in an
incoming mail folder other than the INBOX), in Un*x Pine the folders
are simply flat files stored in a directory.  You can get out of Pine
and cd to that directory.  Then you may edit the file-which-is-a-folder
to your heart's content.  But just don't goof, because if you mess up
you can damage the integrity of the folder.  This methods works, but I
do not recommend it for inexperienced users.

    Depending on your circumstances and what you are trying to
accomplish (i.e., it will not serve in every case), just view the
message you have already received and forward it.  Once you are in the
edit screen, you will be able to edit that message and/or add news
text, as much as you want.

I am connecting to Pine via Telnet from my home computer.  I give this
information because I do not know if that makes a difference.  To continue,
I have a Canon BJC 610 and when I execute the print command nothing
happens. 

In config/setup I have entered the 610 as my computer with "prt" as my
command yet, nothing prints.  What am I doing wrong?

Thank You,

please consult these resources:

The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
help.  Additional information, including a User's Guide, Technical Notes, 
Questions & Answers, where to obtain the Pine software, what tools are 
available to perform tasks that Pine itself does not, and more, can be 
accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.

     - The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
       also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection
       (from Pine's MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to
       folder-collections and choose Add Value) as:

I am having essentially the same problem, except that I don't get any
process launched.  Pine tells me"VIEWER command launched" and just
sits.  My mailcap file is

text/html ; /usr/local/bin/lynx %s

I am using Solaris 2.5.1 and Pine3.96.

I recently started using procmail to filter my mailing list mail into
folders. When I view these folder from the L command in pine it sure would
be nice to see if the folders had new mail or a last modified date so
that I didn't have to open each one to find out. Any ideas?
Thanks Guy.

Subject: searching multiple folders simultaneously

hi folx,

i'm wondering if there is a way to search through several folders
with Pine (especially while using aggregate operations).  i've been
using Pine3.95 for a while, and i've looked at the config file options
in Pine3.96; but i'm coming to the conclusion that this is not a possibly
within Pine, per se.

therefore, i have come up with the follow kludge:

0. touch /var/mail/user.lock
1. cp /var/mail/user /tmp/user
2. cat ~user/mail/* > /tmp/user.all
3. cat /tmp/user.all >> /var/mail/user

after the search is done

4. rm /var/mail/user
5. cp /tmp/user /var/mail/user
6. rm /var/mail/user.lock
7. rm /tmp/user.all
8. rm /tmp/user


if anyone has a more clever solution, i look forward to seeing it.

Len

    I have something which might help, although I'm not sure if it's
exactly what you're looking for.  It does not work within Pine as such 
-- it consists of a shell script and a perl script which drives it --
although you can suspend Pine and run the shell script.  It shows how
many (or zero, if that) items are in each folder.  Browse my WWW home
page, and you can get information and the scripts for free.

I am just curious if anyone knows if there are future plans for an X-based
pine interface like the PC-Pine has.  I like the mouse functionality and
the "NOT-GUI" which it has.  

Thanks,
Chris.

  I strongly sympatize with your view.
  If I want to send a MAIL, I send a (usually short) PLAIN TEXT message.
  Sometimes I even take a longer document (e.g. Word) and convert it to
  PLAIN formatted text to send it via e-mail.

  If I want somebody to share something else I use OTHER means than e-mail :

    - if I want somebody to print a document I've produced, I prepare a
      postscript file and send him a pointer where to ftp it from.

    - the same if I want to share some data

    - if I want somebody to edit a Word document, I will do the same, put
      it (may be in RTF or Macbinary, depends on which OS we are using at
      both ends) in some area to ftp it from.

    - if I prepare an HTML document (I've done some fairly long manuals),
      I put it on my WWW server, and just send around the URL !

  In none of the above cases I use attachments. There is no guarantee that
  a generic correspondent at the other hand may have a MIME-capable mailer
  or the right viewer or anyhow a way to dispose of it. 
  I may agree use of attachments on a person to person basis, if I am sure
  we are compatible. I will never use them for a posting to a wider list.

  The idea is that one wants the guy at the other hand to be able to read
  what you send without ANY action on his side (this includes not having
  to install any s/w, nor to run anything ... for instance I hate those 
  who send conference announcements in Latex  ... just send it plain text,
  or send an URL !)

  When I receive a mail from some list with an attachment which requires
  special actions, I *DISCARD* it.
 
Post-scriptum (off topic)
About HTML. As a convinced X-Mosaic user, I am quite in disagreement with the
disordered development of many variants of HTML, while its power was in its
simplicity.  But when you pass something from (CERN and NCSA) physicists to
commercial people, that's what you get !

I managed to fix it up a bit, once I looked at the index-format info, as
suggested above. However, I think this is a (small) bug in Pine. If it
looked at the sender line, rather than the from line, then all would be
well...

What I did was to set: 

index-format = STATUS MSGNO DATE FROM(20%) TO(20%) SIZE SUBJECT(60%) 

Which produces a slighty squashed format. Here's one of my outgoing messages:

    Go into your configuration and turn on
enable-alternate-editor-implicitly (and check the online help).

    I have never heard of this being done, unless someone else knows
better than I.  I think Pine is deliberately designed to insert the
.signature into the edit space, if you have a sig file defined at all. 
I presume you would have to hack the Pine code to achieve something
else.  (This issue, by the way, has come up in other forums, without
resolution.  I guess you would have to squawk to the Pine Development
Team to allow an option.)

    You don't want the blank line after the header line?  It seems to
fairly common practice.  In the editor/composer you can always delete
it "by hand," I guess.  Personally, I like the blank line there.

Good day,
	
	I'm not sure if this is an appropriate place to ask, but does
anyone have (or know where to find) binaries for pine and pico that will
run on dg/ux?
	If you need anymore specifics about the os version etc let me know
and I can provide it.

	Thx for the time,

What security implications do you have in mind?

(I'm aware of a CERT advisory that implied there were problems with the
protocol, but this is incorrect, the flaws were in some server
implementations...  and UW's code was fixed before we notified CERT.)

An alternative would be to name your .sig something short (for quick 
typing) like '.sig' or 'sig', then, at the bottom of your message, insert 
it manually with Ctrl-R.

Well - for starters - we're moving into a one time password scheme, and if
I'm not mistaken, authentication is required every time one reads mail.
This would make it a hassle for the users to read mail. It seems plausible
to have a solution to read and write unix mail spool files (Berkeley mail
files as you call them, I believe) in NT if it's quite a default feature
in Unix pine.

Please Cc: to me, I'm not registered to this mailing list, I think. :)

Regards,
Nir.

Greetings!

I have a few users who have shell access, and they want to use PINE to 
read their mail when away from home (where they use POP3/Eudora...)

For some reason, (and I know it's a 'permissions' problem), each user 
when they are logged on get the following when opening pine...

   "Can't open mailbox lock, access is readonly"

and at the top of the screen it says:

   "Folder: INBOX(READONLY)"

I'm running BSDI 2.x with PINE 3.91...

Does anybody know which file, or directory that I need to change the 
permissions on?  I just don't know where to look :)

Eric

Would someone please give me a quick thumbnail list of the setup
procedures to get Pine going on our lan?  The lan is a token ring with a
mixture of WIN95 and WFW311 machines.  The mail server is linux.  The
server will eventually act as a proxy server to handle internet mail to
the outside world. The server has all the user names added, and has
actually passed email using Eudora.  I have gotten Pine installed on a
WIN95 machine and have attempted to compose a piece of email, but get an
error calling for a "remote folder."  What else do I need to add to the
server, and where?  Do I need to install 32bit Pine on the WIN95 and
16bit on the WFW311 machines?  Any other tips and thoughts would be
muchly appreciated.  In the mean time, I'll continue to rtfm.

Thank you.

Before you can use PC-Pine to send an e-mail it must have at least one
folder open on your mail server.  This is so that PC-Pine can include
information about the user (such as who the message _really_ came from:
the username used to authenticate to the mail server).

This implies that you must have the appropriate server software installed
on your mail server machine, and have PC-Pine configured to connect to it.
(You will need to do this if you want to read any messages stored in
folders on your server anyway!)

The mail protocol used by PC-Pine for reading messages from mail folders
on the server is called IMAP.  This means that you will need to set up and
configure IMAP server software on your mail server machine.  An IMAP
server is available for various platforms (along with the source code
should you need it) from the University of Washington on the same ftp
server as you (presumably!) got PC-Pine from:

	ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/

Look in the "imap" directory.

Cheers,

--

I do agree that it is a security risk for pine to remember passwords, but
it is very VERY annoying to have to keep typing in the same password
over and over again for the same mail session.  Couldn't pine be given
at least a short term memory?

I have 3 users on VT220s hanging off a SunOS box.  I want them to get 
e-mail using Pine.

Until recently, all users were pulling mail from another SunOS 
server, but I have since moved all mail services to an NT server, 
running POP3 and SMTP.

How can I get mail from that NT server to each of the 3 users running 
VT220s?

If anyone has detailed information on how to do this, I would greatly 
appreciate it.  Looks like all I need is something like Fetchmail to 
get mail to the vt220s, but how do i configure it?  Is there another 
POP client for terminals, which might more easily be configured and 
used?

The long-term plan is to replace these terminals with PCs, so I don't 
want to spend a lot of time on a band-aid solution.

I noticed in the pine-info mailing list there has been some discussion 
about running pine on AIX 4.2, particularly with "hanging up".   I build 
pine a41 on AIX 4.2 and I am having the same problem.  It just hangs and I 
need to kill the process.  I have confirmed that my sendmail is working 
as I can send mail via the common desktop program.  If anyone has any 
helpful advise, it would be greatly appreciated.  I do not subscribe to 
the pine-info mailing list.  Please respond to lynnb@emma.troy.ny.us

Thank you!

Hi!

	This is off topic, but ...

	Does anybody have a standard 'somebody is using your net for
spamming' letter to send to a postmaster?

On the same subject, but more on topic: the value of the
last-time-prune-questioned feature in .pinerc is stored as YY.MM. Is
this Y2K compliant?

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

I really screwed up the other day and deleated a 50-odd address list from
my address book. Fortunately I had mail from each of the folk on the list
so I was able to reconstruct it into a file which I had planned to edit to
fit the .addressbook format and concatenate the two. WHen I went into the
addressbook to see what the formate was, though I found that all the
addresses I'd ever endered were there but with a "DELETED,"ect before. By
removing that peice of the line, I was able to "undelete" the list.

Assuming not only twits like myself make this mistake, I offer it to y'all
so you can do it yourself when you do. Perhaps the powers-that-be could
add this to the help files.

		Be well and happy

Hi,
How do you put a Compuserve address into your pine address book when that
address includes a comma? The comma keeps separate the addresses into to
separate addresses. 

Many thanks,

	Is it possible to save e-mail messages to a diskette in the A
drive using Pine 3.96?  Could someone please explain how in un-technical
language? I honestly have tried to find this info in Pine FAQs, and by
asking at my school, and so far I haven't had any luck.
	Thank you.

All you need to do to both mail a Compuserve user and add his or her 
address to an addressbook in Pine is replace the comma with a period.  I 
have done this and know it works.

Yes, Pine is Y2K compliant.  You just need to know that in three years it
will be year 100.  We did that in anticipation of the year 10,000 problem.

    I use Pine 3.96 under SunOS 4.1.4.  The folling .mailcap entry
works just fine for me:

# Handle text files in HTML format:
text/html; lynx -force_html %s; needsterminal

(lynx is in my $PATH, so I don't need to specify a path in the entry.)

I recently discovered the same feature...

Interestingly my reaction was the opposite: I was disgruntled to learn
that all the entries I'd have had and deleted were still there, taking up
disk space.

I don't know of any indication of this behaviour in the on-line help or,
more usefully, how to "Expunge" the Address Book and get rid of these
"deleted" entries.

Does any one know if it is possible to do this _within Pine_?  If not,
perhaps it should be added?

Cheers,

    Replace the comma with a period.  That's the standard for turning
Compu$erve addresses into Internet-standard addresses.

and hope you can help me from your experience. I have an HP 600C which has
worked great until I used Windelete to clean up my hard drive. Now the print
driver doesn't work. I tried to reinstall the driver but as it tries to read
disk 1 I get and message that a windows file hpfwin02.dll is missing or can
not be loaded. I downloaded a new HP 600 driver from their web sight and it
won't install either(though it just says error and wont do anything). I've
reinstalled Windows 95 twice (once just updating corrupt or missing file and
another full install). Same, same and both accounts.

Should work fine if you are using ANSI terminals, native DG-mode terminals
will require _heavy_ mods to the code.

Thank you to Lee and Roger for the answer.  The APAR IX59378 for AIX4.2 
corrected the "hang" problem that pine was having.   Thank you!

    Put your distribution list in the Bcc: field, and be sure to put
_something_, such as your own address, in the To: field.  Then each
recipient will see only his/her own address.  If your version is recent
enough, you can use the Lcc: field, which you can read about in the
online help.

Hey all, 
 I'm trying to compile pine 3.96 for AIX 4.1 
 When I build pine, the compile goes fine, but the link step fails
with the following errors of undefined symbols:

---------------

there are numerous other undefined symbols which it complains about...

any ideas?

X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Is there a way to have PC Pine setup for many people to use? I know that 
anyone can send mail,but the problem comes with reading of mail. If 
several people have sent mail on one copy of PCPine, the INBOX and 
SENTMAIL folders are not private. Anyone can read each other's mail that 
they have sent. Anyone have an idea around this problem?

thanks, Briton

Dear Sir/Madame,

	I am writing to ask for the lossing mails that I am suffering back
in HK. 

	I have no idea why my messages in the new pine version suddenly
disappeared. I am sure that I did not delete the messages myself. I did
use the email system on Monday but on Thursday, when I tried to log on the
pine, all my inboxing mails have gone (icluding the new and old mails). I
find this situation is very serious. 

	Last time when there was a changes in my mail system, I received a
message from somewhere I don't know telling me that my old mails were
stored in another path - the old mail path. But this time, there is
no warning at all but I just realised that my mails have all gone
(including the address). 

	I don't know what is going on and can you help me to find out the
cause? 


	Thanks for your kind attention.

	Best Regards

Sauw Yim

Subject: Pine hangs when sending mail
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


Hi all,

I am using linux with pine (a recent version) and I have an annoying problem.
When I send mail, the pine program stalls and waits until the mail is actually
sent to the receipient.  This can take 5min.  In others versions of pine that I 
have it just copies it to fcc or whatever and sends in the background, leaving
me to work on pine some more.

Can anyone tell me how to fix this?

Thanks!
Anthony

It isn't possible to do anything with those lines from within pine. We
added it to aid our help desk people when somebody called who had deleted
an important distribution list. Whenever you make a change to your address
book all of the DELETED entries older than 100 days are really deleted. To
reduce the time from 100 days you could change ABOOK_DELETED_EXPIRE_TIME
in adrbklib.h to some smaller number, like 0, and recompile. To get rid of
them by hand you just edit out those lines.

I got some extremely useful help from the pine team on this one (Thanks!). 

If you set the variable alt-addresses to be the mail alias that you used in
 the From line, then pine correctly recognizes you as the sender.

In response to leslie blaine's question:

Yes, a good way to check if your imapd is alive is to
use the test suggested by Edward M Greshko:
        telnet hostname 143   

More likely than not, your Linux box is using a default configuration
which isn't booting the imapd correctly.  Fortunately the solution is 
very easy:

In /etc/inetd.conf make sure the following line exists:

        imapd   stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/sbin/imapd

And in your /etc/services file make sure the following line exists:

        imap2   143/tcp imapd   #Interim Mail Access Proto v2

On the client side, simply use the VLM TCPIP/IPX packet drivers 
from Novell, and PC-Pine for Novel LWP.

Martin Turon

    If your version of Pine is recent enough, there will be a couple of
options in your configuration starting "enable-8bit-..."  Try reading
the online help files for those.

Actually I find this irritating as well, at least when reading news. There
may be hundreds of posts in a newsgroup and I'm not interesting in reading
my own, only responses to me or on the same subject.

Did you mean to say that any FROM-changed to-TO:"newsgroup" will always be
from me? I seem to recall seeing ones not from me on rare occasions but I
may be misremembering.

On a related note: Is there anyway to get Pine News to thread messages? It
would sure save a lot of time.

Subject: Help on "No Options Screen Yet"
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


I'm using pine on a DEC UNIX server and would like to set the 
configurations on this system similar to the configs I have on other 
servers in our campus system. When I attempt to set the configuration 
options (from the Main Menu: Setup: Options), I get a message that 
states: "No Options Screen Yet." I called this to the attention of our 
sys admin, but he is not aware of why this message comes up.

I have searched the Pine FAQs, but didn't find any help. Can some one 
direct us to some information about this problem. I'm suspecting that 
there must be a .conf file missing at the system level (rather than on 
the user level), but this is only an uneducated guess.

Many thanks!

Jim

Pine does not filter mail.  This is in the FAQ.  You need to get hold
of a separate filtering program to do this.  Mailagent is what I
use...  and I like it quite a lot.  It filters your mail before pine
ever sees it.

Hello,

I have a very annooying problem with Unix Pine.

If I have messages and I access my mail account using POP3 they disappear
from my PINE, even when I quit and restart PINE, they are still not there
but, when Telneting to port 110, I can see the messages.

CAN SOMEONE HELP :-(

PS: Once I had a message (automatic message) that was regenerate itself
something with IMAP / POP3 (I think) but now it's gone. Maybe this is
related somehow?

Please help me, and thanks in advance,

Oded.

	Procmail, will do the job for you. Check does ypur system has it

try either of the following in .pinerc:

# Sets domain part of From: and local addresses in outgoing mail.
user-domain=
# If "user-domain" not set, strips hostname in FROM address. (Unix only)
use-only-domain-name=

These can also be set globally in pine.conf or pine.conf.fixed.

I'm not entirely sure this will do what you want since the userid in your
Reply-To: address, (S.Kwong) is different than the userid in your From:
address, (simon).

What you would wind up with, assuming you send a message from bidsrv1.crm,
and that you've set user-domain=cdnair.ca, is
From: Simon Kwong <simon@cdnair.ca>

That might be acceptable if your mail host knows that simon = S.Kwong.

Subject: forwarding problems..

I am in the process of setting up a secure pine server, where there is a
global profile in /etc/profile used instead of the normal .profile in each
user's path. I just modified the pine.conf and here are the adjusted
values..

feature-list=disable-password-cmd,
             disable-keyboard-lock-cmd,
             disable-config-cmd,
             disable-update-cmd

As soon as I started to use these configuration changes, it seems that my
.forward file was not working (or forwarding my mail to planet sendmail
somewhere). Do these config changes (in the pine.conf)
or the use of a 'global' profile file disable the .forward in someway?

Hi, 

  I have problem with sent-mail folder:  (UNIX)

  I use the customized-hdrs to change the "From:" line in Pine, and save
outgoing messages to sent-mail Folder. But when I view the sent-mail
folder, It displays the messages list using my "From:" line instead of the 
"To:" line



sent-mail folder 
 

before adding customized-hdrs  From:

unless I assign a Nickname to a address in my address book then if I 
select them through the list option it will show a "," for the address 
and gives an error when the email is sent. Thanx cya

Hallo,

I've some problems with Pine-3.96 using MMDF-style mailboxes.
If -- while sening -- the first action of Pine is saving a FCC, it does not
recognize a MMDF-style mailbox ans writes the mailbox in unix-style.

Because we are using only MMDF-style mailboxes, I would ask if there
is a way to Pine only to know about this type?

Thanks for help.

Regards
    Andi

Trying to figure out how to encode & decode mime files.  I see that you
suggest mpack & unmpack from ftp.andrew.cmu.edu.  I found those but when I
download it asks for an application to use and I also would like to know if
these can be used for both mac and pc.  Thank you for your help.  I''ve been
trying for a long time to figure out how to do this.

Hello:

One thing you may wish to look at is the value for your smtp-server in
Pine's setup.  Usually this is set globally for you, but there is a chance
your administrator may not have set it up.  Check with your administrator
and ask if you should insert a value there.

You can change this value from Pine's main menu.  Just select S)etup.
C)onfig from the menu and change the value for SMTP server.  Hope this
helps!

Hi. I am having a problem everytime I sign into pine. I have to try for
about 20-50 minutes before I can sign on, and read the main menu. I am
using an IBM 386 DOS version because the windows version never seems to
work. I get the sign "error detected in default", why?
When I use DOS, the last attempt before having to sign off and finally get
into pine I get the uploading, byte, box. But I still have to sign off
and then back on. Is there anything that I can do here? I checked with the
local umuc computer staff, but they could not figure it out, and suggested
I try writing this office. It gets pretty annoying.

This will also happen if there's no From: header on someone else's message.

Maybe an obvious one but how can I tell pine to send ISO-8859-1
messages in 8bit instead of QP ?

Moin,
is there a checkalias or something equivalent available for PINE?
I've written some small scripts depending on checkalias and thus the ELM
adressbook. It would be nicer to have only one (PINE) adressbook, instead 
of updating the ELM adressbook also.

Ciao,
Christian.

Anyone have an idea why pine would crap out with

  Pine Exiting.
  Arithmetic Exception(coredump)

I'm using a precompiled binary, under SunOS 5.5 (tried compiling the
source distribution, but it seemed to need a lot of work.  Give me 
NetBSD any day ...)

There might be an easier way, but here's how I do it:

Go into the setup. Scroll down to "customized-hdrs" and add in your
Reply-To line (Reply-To: address@domain). This will then insert it in any
and all email.

Subject: FREE Cash GRANTS
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN




We Have Over 150 Private Foundations In Our Program
All Over the United States...

WE ARE A FINANCIAL FINDER & MATCHING SERVICE
..."INTEREST - FREE CASH GRANTS!! - NEVER PAY BACK!!!"...


FOUNDATIONS CAN BE A BETTER SOURCE FOR FINANCE, THAN BANKS!
___________________________________________________________
Foundations give away billions of dollars every year to individuals. 
Most are non-profit organizations dedicated to the betterment of
society.  A foundation is excempt  from income tax because its
non-profit status.  Private foundations have been giving out
cash-grants to people for over 100 years.  You can check with your
attorney or local chamber of commerce.

ARE YOU BEING REJECTED FOR THE MONEY YOU NEED SO BADLY?
_________________________________________________________
Then Why Not Try A Private Foundation? Interest Free Cash Grants From
$500.00 & Up to $50,000.00. No Collateral.  No Cosigners, No Security
Deposit, No Mortgages. No Credit Check.  No Pay Back.

ANYONE CAN GET AN INTEREST FREE CASH GRANT!
____________________________________________
As long as they have a genuine reason for needing money, & as long as
the foundation guidelines are met.

Dear Applicant,

This letter tells you HOW YOU CAN GET AN INTEREST-FREE CASH GRANT. 
Take a few minutes to read it. Youll be suprised  to see how easy it
is to get a Cash-Grant, by mail. From time to time, everyone needs to
borrow.  The problem is that for most people making a loan is a big
hassle. Going to banks or finance companies in person takes a lot of
time.  In most cases, thereis endless paperwork.  And Unfortunately,
in many cases all that you end up with is a rejection notice.


ABSOLUTELY NO CREDIT CHECK
________________________
People are getting CASH GRANTS BY MAIL, that are Interest -Free & do
not have to be paid back, in any way.  Getting a Grant by mail is
probably a lot easier than you think.  In your area, there are usually
only a small number of places that will provide you with the money,
that you need.  On the other hand, there are literally hundreds of
private foundations who are anxious to donate money by mail, to people
who have genuine reasons for needing the money.  While it is not
possible for anyone to guarantee that you will receive a CASH GRANT BY
MAIL, the fact is that right now, someone just like you is getting
your grant.

Chances are that most banks in your area have very stringent loan
requirements.  On the other hand, most foundations who give GRANTS BY
MAIL are much more lenient.  Persons who have poor credit, no credit
or even those who have gone through bankruptcy  are able to get the
money that they need BY MAIL sent to them by check payable to them,
because foundations are NOT interested in CREDIT RATINGS.

GETTING A GRANT BY MAIL IS CONFIDENTIAL
____________________________________
There are no embarrassing interviews.  Neither collateral nor
cosigners are required.  The main requirement is that you have a
legitimate need for the money and are willing to use it for whatever
reason that the foundation agrees to.  Everything is handled by mail.

We are not associated with any of the foundations in our program,
therefore all money will go directly to you, payable to you.  As a
Financial Finder & Matching Service, we know where the money is and
which private foundations may be most likely to approver your grant. 
There are actually hundreds of foundations with money that they are
anxious to donate.  It is our job to put you in touch with them.

PLEASE REMEMBER: CASH-GRANTS are FREE of any interest, 
& they DO NOT NEED TO BE PAID BACK!
________________________________________________
Foundations give out money for a wide variety of needs as long as it
is something LEGAL & this means that you obtain the money to pay off
old bills, go on vacation, meet emergency needs or to buy anything
that you might need, as long as the foundation agrees to it. 
Everything is handled by mail.


YOU DECIDE HOW MUCH MONEY YOU WANT TO OBTAIN.  
________________________________________________
The amount can be as little as $500.00 and up to $50,000.00, possible.
 And remember, there is NO CREDIT CHECK.

Interest-Free Cash Grants are ideal for people who have bad credit or
bankruptcy.  If you had trouble in the past dealing with banks, then
these private foundations, are a better source for finances, because
they dont care about bad credit or bankruptcies.  (Foundations do not
do a  credit check on a client..)

As a Financial Finder & Matching Service, well review your service
application form and determine which foundations may be most likely to
provide you with the money that you need.  Keep in mind that we have
only reputable foundations in our program.  You are protected by the
fact that these foundations are regulated by the laws of the United
States.

No matter how much you want to obtain, no matter what you want to use
the money for-we feel confident that we can help you to get it!  With

now that i've wrestled with pine and forced it to work in a roundabout 
way, i'm having .sig problems.  it's getting the .sig alright, but now 
it's putting it above the quoted material, and i prefer it below.  i'm 
awfully confused, because it used to automatically put it below.  btw, 
i'm working with 3.91 now.  ??

Earlier today, I compiled the Pine 3.96 on a Hewlett-Packard Model 730
using HP-UX 9.x.  It came out to 6 Megs for the Pine binary.

Am I doing something wrong here?  Or is Pine going the way of Microsoft: 
The product doubles in size every 4 revisions.

For comparison, on a DECstation or RS6000 the stripped binary is
about 2MB.

    Why not just uuencode the files "by hand" using an external
uuencode utility and then read them into the body of the messages being
sent?  It may not be the so-called cleanest method, i.e., not fully
automated, but it should work.

Is there a way to direct PINE to filter your mail into a specific folder 
as soon as it comes into your mailbox?

Is there a way to get PINE to send out an automatic response when mail 
comes in? Like if a person is on vacation and has absolutely no chance 
of getting to their mail for quite awhile?

This message is being sent to this mailing list weekly in order to
aid readers in finding information about Pine.  Before sending questions 
to the mailing list -- which is mirrored in the newsgroup comp.mail.pine --
please consult these resources:

The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
help.  Additional information, including a User's Guide, Technical Notes, 
Questions & Answers, where to obtain the Pine software, what tools are 
available to perform tasks that Pine itself does not, and more, can be 
accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.

     - The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
       also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection
       (from Pine's MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to
       folder-collections and choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/docs/[]
    

The messages from this mailing list/newsgroup are archived.  These archives
can be accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/
       (includes a searchable index of all archived messages, and information
        on how to subscribe to this mailing list)

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/pine-info/.

     - From within Pine by defining a folder collection (from Pine's MAIN
       MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to folder-collections and 
       choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/pine-info/[]

If you have a question about Pine, chances are it has been asked before
and you can find the answer either through the searchable index of past
messages, or among the "Questions & Answers" at the URL: 

http://www.washington.edu/pine/QandA/ 
  or
ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs/QandA.txt

If you need personal assistance with using or configuring Pine, contact
the technical support staff or computer help desk of your Internet Service
Provider, school, university, employer, ... -- whichever organization
provided you with the email account on which you are using, or planning on
using, Pine.  Because system functions and configuration can vary from
site to site, they are best qualified to assist you.  (Due to the large
number of Pine installations worldwide, the University of Washington
cannot provide individual support services to Pine users at other
organizations.)

Definitly not by writing to a newsgroup that says
comp.mail.pine... Why don't you just do what we all do and ask good
ole metacrawler?
	http://www.metacrawler.com

There's stuff like this:
	bionet.neuroscience
whatever that may be >:->

Later,

I have not had a desire to change the default viewing in Pine, but in the
Configuration, you may want to check out the Sort Key and check _Subject_
or _Subject_Ordered_. Don't know if it will work, but if that is what you
want, it might be worth  a shot. If it doesn't work the way you want, you
can always set it back to the way it was.

	Hummmm.....I believe the original question was along the lines of
how to affect the "index" display and reorder the information on a line.
Like yourself, I've not tried this one....but I would check out the:

index-format=

	feature....after reading the "help" of course.  :-) :-)

I really don't know how it's supposed to be done. I just (E)xport it to a
local file and edit it with VI.
As for including it in another message, I just (^R)ead it into the
document I am writing.
I have been doing this ever since I started using Pine.

All of a sudden, Saturday and today, my Pine account no longer sends sent
messages to the "sent-mail" folder.

Question 1) How do I [re]set my program in order to have sent mail sent to
		"sent-mail"

Question 2) How do I verify that a message has been sent, with or without
		the message appearing in the "sent-mail" folder?

Thanks for your help.

Dear people from Pine,

Last week my Inbox had a message with subject like "Do not delete this
message!", but I delete it and... ALL my data is lost!

Can I retrieve this data? Is this a normal message or a mail bomb?

Please, help me!
Carlos

What means, "All my data is lost"?

Does it mean that all your email is gone?  Did it all vanish as the same
time you deleted that message?  Did it vanish some time later?
Be more specific.
 
> Can I retrieve this data? Is this a normal message or a mail bomb?

You will have to ask your service provider if your lost email (or
whatever) has been "backed up".

BTW, the message you deleted is a "somewhat normal" message.  It is a
marker message placed there by the IMAP server on the system.  Next
time, don't delete it.

If you *really* want help you'll be more descriptive.  What kind of
printer do you have?  How is it connected to your system?  What do you
have in the setup for the print command?

You have aske the equivalent of "Doctor, my head hurts.  What should I
do?".

Ken,
  Under Setup, Config,  check the box that says
"preserve-start-stop-characters"

This should take care of the problem.  I run Wyse-60 terminals at 38400
and pine works great.

hey,

I got a letter the other day with the attachtment "application/ms-tnef".
I understand that it requires some sort of plug-in that I don't have. 
Would you please tell me how to read the letter or send me what I need
to read it, or if all else fails please tell me where I can download the
software to read it.  I'm kind of desperate because the letter is of
mild importance to me.  Thank you very much.

Sincerely,

Luke Lambert

(Lambert5@Erols.com)

No, but if you use Pine, you probably have access to a Unix Shell. If that
is the case, then create a file named 
		.forward
in your home directory and use Pico or VI to place your Email address in
that file.
Or, you can simply type the following:
	echo user_name@forwarding.address > .forward
in your home directory.

    No.  In the opinion of some of us, lack of killfile capability is
one of the major shortcomings of Pine.  THere are ways you can kludge
around this defect to some extent, but they are non-Pine issues and
depend on your system and what is available on it.

ms-tnef is a MicroSoft propietary markup language, generated by
MS-Exchange if I'm not mistaken. You should be able to ask the sender to 
resend the message in "plain text"....or you could use MS-Exchange...but
that would be "wrong".  :-) :-)

I would find a centralized .newsrc file very interesting too.
Could it be implemented in slrn ?

This:

You may "Select" a print command as your default printer.
  You may also add custom print commands to the list in the "Personally"
  selected print command" section below.

    Default printer currently set to "attached-to-ansi".

 Printer attached to IBM PC or compatible, Macintosh *highlighted*
      This may not work with all attached printers, and will depend on the
      terminal emulation/communications software in use. It is known to
work
      with Kermit and the latest UW version of NCSA telnet on Macs and
PCs,
      Versaterm Pro on Macs, and WRQ Reflections on PCs.
        Printer: attached-to-ansi *highlighted*
                 attached-to-ansi-no-formfeed

 Standard UNIX print command
      Using this option may require setting your "PRINTER" or "LPDEST"
      environment variable using the standard UNIX utilities.
        Printer List: ""                      lpr                           

 Personally selected print command *highlighted*
      The text to be printed will be piped into the command given here.
The
      command is in the 2nd column, the printer name is in the first
column. Som
      examples are: "prt", "lpr", "lp", or "enscript". The command may be
given
      with options, for example "enscript -2 -r" or "lpr -Plpacc170". The
      commands and options on your system may be different from these
examples.
        Printer List:

NEED HELP,

Can somebody help with this printing problem on SUN machine.

1) I have roughly about 40 printers on this sun spark 5 connected
remotely.

when the machine is first booted up 40 child lpd deamons come up and
check the que and all of the clean itself up as there id nothing there
for printing.

2) when somebody prints off this machine an lpd child process starts and
does not send the job for printing to remote machine (as per setup in
the printcap file).

Interesting thing is that if you run trace on this child process,
everything is good and the print job comes out.

Therefore it seems like communication to the remote machine is good but
on this machine somehow gets triggered by trace command.

Any suggestion please respond to me at sgurnani@shl.com

Thanks in advance.

Sunil

I just download the pine v3.96 of SunOS-bin.  It works well except sending
email out.  

The problem is that when I send an email to an individual address, it exits
abnormally;  while sending to newsgroup, seems ok.  The error message pine
giving looks like

	Problem detected: "Received abort signal".
	Pine Exiting.
	Arithmetic Exception (core dumped)

Could  anyone give me some advive?  Thanx in advance.  -Ping

The problem:

I'm trying to see if I should switch from elm to pine.
One reason would be to get spell-checker implemented.
But: pine seems to make little distinction between
the speller and the editor. I want lets say vi as my
default editor, invoked automatically, and the option
of doing a spell check with ispell once the message is
edited. I see that I can get both functionalities, if
I invoke them each time explicitly, (with ^_ (BAD name for a 
command, hard to type) or ^t (why not ^s ?) for alternate
editor, speller resp.) but if I set vi (say) to be the
default editor, I can't get the cursor into the body
of the message without invoking the editor and I want the
speller.

If you understand this, please reply to me directly.

Thanks much!

You should talk to your "service" provider.  It seems they have a
pinerc.fixed file installed which will prevent you from changing some
variables.  They have probably done this for your protection.  :-)

Pine, 
Hi. I sent you a message about signing on to pine on Saturday, I
think. Well, I was wondering did someone repair something? Because this is
the firs time that I have not had to sign on more than once to get here?
Anyway, I just wanted to let you know. Or is it optimum frequency at work? 

Ciao,

Aaron Terry

Sorry for the slight off-topic. 
I am trying to get rid of unwanted SPAM, and I've set up procmail with a
"blacklist" of spammers. But of course I'm receiving mail from NEW spammers,
so I have to add their address manually to the blacklist.

I've noticed that most spams include an X-Uidl: field in their header.
What is the purpose of this field, and which s/w generates it ?
Can I be confident to get rid of all messages containing such field, i.e. are
they all spam and no "good" messages ?

Hi Folks,

I work on a variety of different computers (Unix, NT, Win95) in a variety
of locations (the office, home, on the road with a notebook) and I've
found Pine/IMAP to be an excellent solution for me.  Kudos to the dev
team!

But I'd like to beef up the NNTP support a tiny bit, if I could.  I'd like
a way to store the .newsrc file on the IMAP server instead of on the local
disk.  This would give me *one* .newsrc file that works on all of my
environments, which would definately be an improvement over what I've got
now.

I understand that IMAP wasn't designed to be a file system.  But it seems
to me hacking in support for a .newsrc in some folder would be a big
enough win that overall elegance would improve?

Comments?

Kelly

Kelly,
There won't be a complete solution to remote access to configuration and 
subscription data in pine 4, but:

The IMAP server that will be available with Pine 4.00 will have the
ability to act as an NNTP client; i.e. it can be an IMAP->news-server
proxy.  This mode of operation will maintain your .newsrc on the IMAP
server.

Hi,
How may I send the same message system wide to all users?  I guess I'm
asking, how do I create a list of all of the users in the system without
keying in their names one-by-one?  Any help would be appreciated.
Doug

Pine,
Hi. For the first time since using the WINDOWS version of Tycho, have I
ever been able to get into PINE. Could it be because I changed the
function settings in the debugging section to enable all three, Tycho,
Kermit, and Vt-100? I prefer to use the windows version because it is
easier to sign on. However, how can I make the program selections work
just with the mouse? Or, do I want to do that since I have the tycho
version also on DOS, and would this effect my being able to use it.
Before, when signing into PINE under windows, I kept gettig the message
application error close, or ignore. When I chose ignore the system would
only have close, and  when I clicked close the screen would freeze up.
Why? I would have to reset the computer. 

Thanks again,

Aaron

Hi,

I was trying to install pine 3.96 and downloaded the pre-compiled
binaries. I had the following results:

SunOS:	Works great! thanks!
OSF:	Segmentation fault	(3.95 works)
Ultrix:	Memory exception	(3.95 works)

Our ultrix system is 4.2 on a DECstation 5000

Ous OSF system is 3.2c on an Alpha 255

Is there something wrong? Did I do something wrong? Am I gonna have to
compile them myself?

Thanks in advance for any help.

One of PINE's greatest assets is that it can be used from any glass
terminal, not requiring any particular graphical display, user interface,
mouse, &etc.  Even in today's world of cheap computers and the Internet,
the reality is that sometimes - and sometimes often - it is necessary
(or, to me, desirable) to NOT be forced to use a graphical interface.

Please DON'T expend any effort on putting a graphical user interface
on PINE.  Instead, continue to make it one of the best mail tools
there is, integrating technologies like encryption, more generalized
filters, &etc.  Adding a graphical interface will draw vast amounts
of time away from the core of the program.

If she *really* sent the mail, then check the sendmail logs (if your
using SMTP) on the mail hub and/or on the client for any evidence
of the mail being sent.

Your postmaster may also be able to help if you know the approximate
time the message was sent.

Dear University of Washington Pine Help Line,

I was working on my email and  was about to send a message and pressed
control T by mistake. Now it won't let me read my messages. Error comes on
the screen for the three messages I was reading recently. What can I do?
The message I was on is blank on the screen except for the number. Please
help.

Thanks,  Ivette Vargas

In my experiance with pine, sometime it is best to compile them yourself
like you asked.  You'll want to download the source and probably try the
base build with the appropriate three letter OS code.  I believe the
ultrix is 'ult' and osf is just 'osf'.  You can find out using the 'build
help'.  If you still have problems after that I'm sure we can help more
with specific examples of when and what happens to receive the errors.

Subject: Refusing messages from specific addresses
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

I'm using pine and I often get silly mails. Now I'd like to know
if there's an option within pine that lets you refuse mails from
single persons so that I won't receive their mails anymore. If
there's no such option within pine perhaps there exists another
possibility to gain the wanted effect.

Please send me an Email if you've got a solution for my problem
because I haven't the chance to look up newsgroups very often.
My address is <jacobi@asrv01.stn-atlas.de>

Thanks a lot.

Dear pine-users,

Following procedures described in pine help, I setup the option 
news-collection = News /[], but it does not work. I can not find and 
subscribe the newsgroups.

I do have a file .newsrc in my home directory in the Unix system.

thank you

Dear Sir/Madam,
I am using pine mail at my internet service. It has displayed the sign
"you have bug in your  mail system check it with pine mail".

Could you kindly explain what does that mean.

Thanks.

Hi!My name is Sue Ford. Iam taking graduate courses this summer to work
towards my permanant certification in special ed. One of my assignments is
to find a special ed. teacher on the "net" and do a ten question
interview.Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to respond to
the 10 questions about the field of special ed. and send them back to me,
provided this message doesn't self-destruct because of my lack of computer
skills.I'm sure this is just what you always wanted to do on your
vacation (yeah;right1), but seriously, I'd be eternally
grateful.How's that for motivation?In advance, thank you for your time and
patience. .
Here they are  
1 What role do you have in the assessment of students suspected of having
a disability? 
2 Has the role changed over the years?
3 Is it important for you to be able to understand students' evaluation
reports?
4 Is it important to be able to understand test scores and what they
mean?
5 What type of informatiion is most valuable in determining 

         whether a student is disabled?
         the special education service a student needs?
6 How do you determine  students'learning progress?
7 In your opinion, who plays the dominant role in the pre-referral process
of students with special needs?
8 What is the pre-referral process in your district?
9 What ares could be changed to improve the effectiveness of the
assessment process?
10 Do you have input into what tests are given for assessment purposes?

Well, that completes the interview. Thank you to anyone who took the time
to reply.Have a great summer and good luck in September!And we're out of
here!

[Posted and mailed]

I'm in total agreement with Kelly (with whom I work).  Mail with pine
rocks.  I would love to use it for news as well, but there are just a
few missing features missing that force me to use another news reader
for now...  In addition to being able to access a remote .newsrc file
via IMAP, I would also like to see some "unseen" information on the
folders list (useful for both mail and news).  Those two features
right there would attach me to pine forever.  :)

This:

You may "Select" a print command as your default printer.
  You may also add custom print commands to the list in the "Personally"
  selected print command" section below.

    Default printer currently set to "attached-to-ansi".

 Printer attached to IBM PC or compatible, Macintosh *highlighted*
      This may not work with all attached printers, and will depend on the
      terminal emulation/communications software in use. It is known to
work
      with Kermit and the latest UW version of NCSA telnet on Macs and
PCs,
      Versaterm Pro on Macs, and WRQ Reflections on PCs.
        Printer: attached-to-ansi *highlighted*
                 attached-to-ansi-no-formfeed

 Standard UNIX print command
      Using this option may require setting your "PRINTER" or "LPDEST"
      environment variable using the standard UNIX utilities.
        Printer List: ""                      lpr                           

 Personally selected print command *highlighted*
      The text to be printed will be piped into the command given here.
The
      command is in the 2nd column, the printer name is in the first
column. Som

I recently tried to upgrade from Pine 3.95 to 3.96, but unfortunately I am
encountering the following problems when it starts compiling Pine.

*********************************************************************

/pine/3.96/imap/ANSI/c-client/tcp_unix.c:136: undefined reference to
'__inet_addr'

/pine/3.96/imap/ANSI/c-client/tcp_unix.c:546: undefined reference to
'__inet_ntoa'

**********************************************************************

pico and pilot were successfully installed however.

I will appreciate any help on this problem :)

Thanks

You can't... Pine is an e-mail program, not an IRC program.

If you're on a college system and many people are accessing it off of 
PINE, it means someone, somewhere, has it worked into their directory. 
Sometimes commands such as:

run [????.irc]irc

will work for you -- that is the code we use to run IRC thru PINE. But 
it would all depend on the name of the person, and whether or not your 
system supports it. Your best bet is to finger someone using IRC, and 
then mail them and ask how they got on.

    IRC and Pine are two completely separate functions that have
nothing to do with each other.

P] Problem:  UserID "clint" hates Content-Type "text/html" PINE attach-
   ments. These are often sent as 7bit, from Netscape or Internet Mail.

--------------------------How To Patch This---------------------------

1] Locate the system-wide "mailcap" file on your UNIX system.  For ex.,
   I found the file on my ISP's UNIX machine at: /etc/mailcap

2] Copy the file to your home directory, or wherever it's convenient.
   eg. You would type at a UNIX prompt: cp /etc/mailcap ~clint/.mailcap

3] Now open your "local copy" in your favorite editor, ie. EMACS. <grin>
   eg. You would type at the UNIX prompt: emacs ~clint/.mailcap

4] Add the following lines to your file, as they appear here exactly:

text/html; shownonascii iso-8859-1 %s; \
        copiousoutput
text/html; shownonascii iso-8859-8 %s; \
        copiousoutput
text/html; shownonascii iso-8859-7 %s; \
        copiousoutput

5] Now you have to tell PINE that your ~clint/.mailcap file supercedes the
   system wide /etc/mailcap file.  To do this, open PINE and type these:

	m		for Main Menu
	s		for Setup
	c		for Config
	w		for WhereIs? (as in, a question)
	mailcap		type that word to search for it.
	c		to Change the value of what's there.

6] Once you find the line, change whatever is there to the following:

mailcap-search-path      = /my/home/dir/path/clint/.mailcap:/etc/mailcap

7] You should be set now.  (It's been leaked to me that PINE 4.00 will have
   its own internal simple HTML viewer to "translate" into plain text!)

8] ATTENTION ADVANCED PINE USERS: I'm sure instead of "copiousoutput"
   someone could figure out how to pipe the raw output through "lynx?"

-----------------------------Patch Done!------------------------------

Actually, no it's not.  Lines that begin with "From " are escaped out as

you'll find the top of each header.  Nowhere else will have it.  To see

I say go ahead, make your own script.  You'll be able to put what you want
in there and have it do exactly what you want.  Besides, it'll be more
fun.

I was wondering how do I go about setting up a plan on my e-mail for when
people look up my account?

I am currently conducting research on HOME PAGE DESIGN.
My first step in this regard was to obtain expert opinion.
Two months ago, I have posted a survey consisting of four
general questions. Based on that input, I have designed the 
questionnaire listed below. I would be very grateful to you 
if you would respond to this  questionnaire. I will share the
final results of the collected information with all those who
responded to these questions.

Thanks a lot for your cooperation.

Hello to all,

I run linux pine at home, and up until recently have had virtually no 
problems.  Now, however, when I start pine it gives me the error message 
"[Can't open mailbox lock, access is readonly]" and won't allow me to 
delete messages from my INBOX.  I have checked the permissions on my 
INBOX file and my mail directory, so I don't understand why this is 
happening (there are no other instances of pine running.)  Can someone 
tell me how to correct the problem?   Thanks for your time.

				Sincerely,

					Glendon M. Gross

You mean tidy up a bit to make it presentable?

First thing you do is install a filtering system, then set up incoming 
folders like this:

# Collections, Folders, and Files
# List of incoming msg folders besides INBOX, e.g. ={host2}inbox,
# {host3}inbox Syntax: optnl-label {optnl-imap-host-name}folder-path
incoming-folders="Robin"        ~/Mail/IN/IN.robin,
        "Faxes"                  ~/Mail/IN/IN.fax
etc.

Then prune all your read mail once in a while. Set the following flag:
	enable-aggregate-command
and say something like 
	; a a d 
in a folder full of old mail.

Or did you mean something else? >;-> If you need to be fingered, say:

	<your_favourite_editor_here> ~/.plan

and then type in the information you want to give away. The
information has to be plain text, not Winword documents.

Later,
Robin

1.  Start your World-Wide Web browser.

2.  Use it to go the Web page whose URL is http://www.washington.edu/pine

Cheers,

    Version 3.94 is out of date.  The current version is 3.96.  (The
"official" source code is at the University of Washington in Seattle.)
I cannot say exactly where in the source code you have to change the
variable, because I have never done it myself.  Remember, Pine was
designed to forbid you to do what you want to do unless you start
mucking around with the code, at which point all bets are off.

Hi all, 

I haven't found an answer to this question in my RTFM efforts, so...

I was wondering if it's possible to get Unix pine to check usernames against
the NIS master password file instead of /etc/passwd.  I'd like pine to be able
to extract full name info from the password file, but with NIS running,
/etc/passwd doesn't contain information for normal users.

Please at least Cc replies to e-mail.

Thanks in advance for any help.

	-Ed

Ask your sysadmin.

This is often a "if you don't know how, you shouldn't be doing it"
question, and most sysadmins do not want these types of messages going to
all the users on the system, which puts a burden on the mail system.

If you are the sysadmin, then you should have easy access to an entire
userlist, but would still probably be better off using an /etc/motd file
rather than system wide email.

This usually means you (or someone) is running Pine with your account
somewhere else.. on another box maybe...

You cannot have 2 Pines running, or one of them will be read-only.

Whenever I add a new spam filter, I send the "spam" to a folder named 
Junk.  Once I'm statisfied that the new filter is only catching span, 
than I change the filter to send the stuff to /dev/null.

Well, Lynx won't accept "-" as a parameter meaning take the file for input.
But you could create a script like

[/usr/local/bin/lynxstdin]

#!/bin/sh

/bin/cat - > /tmp/..ls.$$
/usr/local/bin/lynx -force_html /tmp/..ls.$$
/bin/rm -f /tmp/..ls.$$

Or something along those lines at least :)

How about saving the message in your "postponed mail" folder.  Then do a
Compose and edit the message.  When done, ostpone it again, Then go to the
"Postponed" folder and save the message back to where you want it.  I
called my postpone folder DRAFT. 

Personally, I liked the suggestion of editing the mail folder from vi or
pico.  Just don't delete any lines that have ctrl-As (^A^A^A^A^A) in them.

I have a problem with time stamps from my SGI Irix PINE to a PC running
Win95, using Netscape's e-mail reader.  The PC end always gets a GMT time
stamp from me.  I can use the simple UNIX mail program from this machine,
or any other in our network, and the problem disappears.  The problem
seems to be only with PINE.  The time stamp is correct in the reverse
direction. 

As a test ... I am sending you this e-mail at 12:10 Friday 6-27-97.

Any and all suggestions would be appreciated.

I want to do a bulk advertising of a product idea and see if it will sell.
 Could you suggest the best possible way to do this without getting into
trouble or making people angry. It seems like there are a lot of services on
the net and I don't want to get ripped off either.  Suggestions would be
appreciated.  Thanks

Yes, send *all* your advertising to "/dev/null".

I can tell you how I did it, and maybe it's the way others would do it.

All I did was to go into the the folder where you want the 'folder' to be,
and then ftp to the place where the 'folder' actually is.  Then, 'get' the
file, and you have transferred the file.

I've had to do this when I changed accounts, and it works fine for me.

Yeah, me too... Yours for example was exquisitely silly...

-    When you join a list, monitor the messages for a few days to get a feel
     for what common questions are asked, and what topics are deemed
     off-limits. This is commonly referred to as lurking. When you feel
     comfortable with the group, then start posting.

-    See if there is a FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) for a group that you
     are interested in joining. Veteran members get annoyed when they see
     the same questions every few weeks, or at the start of each semester.

Sure -- you could, for example, shoot yourself. Otherwise, you could
RTFM (yes, you *do* want filtering...):

    _________________________________________________________________

  How can I filter messages into different incoming folders?

   Pine does not perform delivery filtering; that is the function of
   other programs, such as (on Unix hosts) "procmail" or "mailagent." For
   details on selection and configuration of such programs, see the
   Filtering Mail FAQ (by Nancy McGough) at one of the following
   locations:

   http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/mail/filtering-faq/
   faq.html
   http://www.smartpages.com/faqs/mail/filtering-faq/faq.html
   ftp://ftp.halcyon.com/pub/ii/internet/filtering_mail_faq.txt
   ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/mail/filtering-faq

   Once you have successfully set up your delivery filtering, you will
   have new mail arriving in several different folders, in addition to
   your INBOX. You can then access these folders just like any other mail
   folder. You can also define a collection of incoming message folders
   in Pine, through which you can then TAB to read new messages. For more
   information, see Pine's internal help on the enable-incoming-folders
   feature in Pine's SETUP CONFIGURATION menu.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

On our SCO 5 system we are using MMDF as the e-mail system.

Besides we have IMAPD, IPOP2D and IPOP3D from the Pine distribution
installed.

When one or more of the users INBOX (in /usr/spool/mail/usr-id) gets
over a certain size the SCO 5 system nearly dies if the user attacehs
his e-mail. The SCO 5 system gets extreme slow and works very heavily on
the disk. E.g. today my own INBOX got the size of 16957 KB. That was
enough to bring the SCO 5 to near death.

What can the reason be for that ? Is there anything I can do to solve
the problem ?

As it gets more and more usual that users sends documents of different
kinds to each others via e-mail the problem have become very critical
here.

Thanks in advance for any help.

In the main menu there is an option to write or edit you're signiture.
Once you have done this, Pine will add it automaticly. 

I have a secount question. How do I NOT include it or have a secount sig.
I know it can be done in UNIX mail. Is writinging a file and doing ^r my
only option?

Upgrade to the most recent UW imapd - there have been significant
improvements recently as far as memory is concerned.

Another imapd worth considering is Cyrus imapd. It supports
searching in folders using characters sets other than US-ASCII,
the main reason why I switched to Cyrus. Otherwise I feel
that UW imapd is more convenient.

Well, as far as I can tell, you must have invoked the spell checker by
accident. On my system(s), there is a menu at the bottom which tells you which
options are available from the spell checker, (X for exit). Your system may
differ, but you should be able to exit the spell checker somehow, and get back
to Pine. Sorry I can't help better than that...

The same as the "circular file"....sometimes called the "trash".

For sure this is not a pine topic...but I doubt you will find many people, if 
any, on this list who likes "bulk" (a.k.a. junk) mailings.

     -------------8<--------- snip here -----8<------------------
NAME
       null, zero - data sink
DESCRIPTION
       Data  written on a null or zero special file is discarded.
       Reads from the null special  file  always  return  end  of
       file, whereas reads from zero always return \0 characters.
       null and zero are typically created by:
              mknod -m 666 /dev/null c 1 3
              mknod -m 666 /dev/zero c 1 5
              chown root.mem /dev/null /dev/zero
FILES
       /dev/null
       /dev/zero
     -------------8<--------- snip here -----8<------------------

Yeah, right... But then again, what would I use my new-found toy
"junk.el" on? That's something pine could use: a function that fires
up a standard complaint to the usual guys: abuse@aol.com,
postmaster@aol.com, loser@aol.com etc.

And for the German readers: There's a nice article on UCE / Spam in
the new edition of c't.

Have a nice weekend,
Robin

Hi,

I have begun using netscape mail for certain types of mailing and I have
found that once a message appears in the Inbox it is wiped clean from
the Pine INBOX.  Obviously I'd prefer the messages to remain in my pine
Inbox too.

Can you help?

    My suggestion?  DON'T DO IT.  With bulk email you will probably
anger far, far, far, far, far, far more people than you will get real
leads, even if you are legitimate.  Pardon me for being sceptical, but
we are so inundated with trash email these days masquerading as
advertising that a lot of people cordially despise *anybody* who sends
out this stuff, legitimate or not (most of it is not).

Subject: does disable-kblock-cmd work?
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

We have a problem with users locking their keyboards and forgetting 
what they used for a password.  I saw where you could put in the 
pine.conf.fixed file a value for feature-list disable-kblock-cmd that
would remove that feature, but I can't seem to get it working.  We are
on Pine 3.95.  Alternatively, if there was a way to force double entry
of the password, that would cut down the probelms also. Is there a way
to get this working?

That means your system has a _very_ old version of Pine, before the
Setup/Config screen was implemented...

If your IMAP server is running the UW imapd, it should be possible to
get imapd to proxy the connection to your News server, in which case
the .newsrc file will be stored on the IMAP server.  To do this,
configure a news-collection something like

	{imapserver.domain}{newsserver.domain/nntp}[]

Good luck!

I would suggest that you don't use *any* service that sends out email to
people. Many spammers will claim that they have lists of people who
"want" email but instead just send it to their normal list of every
address they can get. I have heard stories of small business who got
suckered into this and totally lost any good name they had (not to mention
getting abuse, people ringing they 800 number etc etc etc)

I would suggest you set up a small homepage for your product (this should
cost less than $20/month for the space). Do a fairly simple design for
your page (just a single page possibly with background and descriptions 
(and maybe a small picture) and email address or phone number for more
information).

You then want to publicize it. The best way it to add it all the search
engines (see www.submit-it.com) and then possibly advertising on a few web
pages related to your product. You might want to put the URL of your page
in your .sig as well so people who read your posts might be interested.

Whatever you do:

1. DON'T email people ads
2. DON'T posts ads for your product/site to newsgroups unless the groups
   charter specificly allows it (and 99.9% don't)

Subject: WHERE TO FIND INFORMATION ABOUT PINE
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


This message is being sent to this mailing list weekly in order to
aid readers in finding information about Pine.  Before sending questions 
to the mailing list -- which is mirrored in the newsgroup comp.mail.pine --
please consult these resources:

The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
help.  Additional information, including a User's Guide, Technical Notes, 
Questions & Answers, where to obtain the Pine software, what tools are 
available to perform tasks that Pine itself does not, and more, can be 
accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.

     - The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
       also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection
       (from Pine's MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to
       folder-collections and choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/docs/[]
    

The messages from this mailing list/newsgroup are archived.  These archives
can be accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/
       (includes a searchable index of all archived messages, and information
        on how to subscribe to this mailing list)

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/pine-info/.

     - From within Pine by defining a folder collection (from Pine's MAIN
       MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to folder-collections and 
       choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/pine-info/[]

If you have a question about Pine, chances are it has been asked before
and you can find the answer either through the searchable index of past
messages, or among the "Questions & Answers" at the URL: 

http://www.washington.edu/pine/QandA/ 
  or
ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs/QandA.txt

If you need personal assistance with using or configuring Pine, contact
the technical support staff or computer help desk of your Internet Service
Provider, school, university, employer, ... -- whichever organization
provided you with the email account on which you are using, or planning on
using, Pine.  Because system functions and configuration can vary from
site to site, they are best qualified to assist you.  (Due to the large
number of Pine installations worldwide, the University of Washington
cannot provide individual support services to Pine users at other
organizations.)

I found it all, and cancelled my post, apparently too late :)

Who am I supposed to write to get this submitted into the FAQ?

I use in my ~/.mailcap file the line:

text/html; lynx -force_html -child %s; needsterminal; test=test "$DISPLAY$LYNX_VERSION" = ""

You could also use:

text/html; lynx -force_html -dump %s; copiousoutput; test=test "$DISPLAY$LYNX_VERSION" = ""

The first one lets lynx save or follow the links in the document, the second 
just gives you a references section at the end.

Subject: gooey email clients
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Does anybody know of any gui email clients for Xwindows?  I got
majordomo set up last night and have discovered I would like to be
able to exploit Xwindows for maintenance purposes (pine is functional,
but I want something running in X like the email client that comes
with Netscape but not so heavy handed).

If you mean it is taking things out of your pine inbox I have no clue
as to how to help.  If you mean it reads mail from your mail server
and then wipes the mail out so that you cannot pull it down with pine
then check your mail settings in Netscape and make sure you have the
'leave on server' selection turned on.  HTH

I untared pine3.94 from ftp.uni-stuttgart.de/pub/unix/comm/mail, but did not found a header file or
something like that with the above (or something sound-a-like) option.

Would you please take a look and tell me exactly where to find that?

Humpf? Pine is an email program, period. What you want is e.g. a
custom printer that utilizes, say, hylafax or some other fax
program. Apart from that, there are email2fax programs and even
websites available. Check your favourite search engine
(http://www.metacrawler.com) for further information.

But the easiest thing for you to do might be to pipe the exported
message into sendfax.

Later,
Robin

Here's something from the tech-notes (again) that came with your tarball:

   Most of Pine's behaviors are set in the file ./pine/osdep/os-xxx.h,
   which includes comments that explain each setting. Some of these can
   only be set when you compile. Others, however, can be overridden by
   command-line flags to Pine or settings in Pine's user or system
   configuration files. Some of the options which can be set when
   compiling:
   ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM
          Determines whether users are allowed to modify the From line on
          outgoing mail. Even with this turned on, users will have to
          include From in their default-composer-hdrs or customized-hdrs
          in order to be able to edit the From line. Default is to not
          allow any changing.

BTW, 3.94 is outdated, get the src-tarball for 3.96.

Later,
Robin

Everytime I compose to a newsgroup, the sender name (next to date) always
says To:alt.binaries.....(name of newsgroup).  How do I get my name to be

Subject: Processing newsgroups while in Pine?
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

I'm sorry if this has been asked before.  We have been noticing that
when people post a news article with Pine that in order to read that
news article, or any new article that is posted during that time, that 
they need to exit Pine, wait a couple minutes for the new articles to
be indexed, and then re-enter Pine. Then, their posting will appear
in the newsgroup after they re-enter Pine and go into the group.

Is there any configuration option in Pine to allow it to do background
processing of newsgroups so that any new news articles that are posted
in a particular group while a person is reading news in pine those new
articles will appear in their index?  Does Pine handle doing on-the-fly
indexing of newsgroups?

Any help would be most appreciative.

thanks

Joe Karam

Attach File Command

   The attach file command: Ctrl-J (with the cursor located in the header
   area of the message composition screen) is the primary means of
   attaching an external file as a MIME attachment. The attachment will
   be encoded to ensure safe delivery at the receiving end, which means
   that you can attach any type of file: spreadsheet, CAD drawing,
   desktop-published document, clipart graphic, and so on. However, the
   recipient of your message needs to have email software capable (more
   and more are) of handling MIME attachments.

   The file to be attached must be on the same system as Pine. If you use
   Pine on a Unix machine but have files on a PC or Macintosh, the files
   must be transferred to the Unix system running Pine before they can be
   attached to the message being composed. Please ask your local
   consultants about the correct way to transfer a file to your Pine
   system as the method will vary from site to site.

   You cannot use any wildcards in specifying the file to be included.
   You can type in the filename directly or use Pine's file browser to
   select one from the listing of files in your directory.

PN> b.  Is spelling chacker available ?

Spell Check Command

   (Note: there is no spell checker for the 32-bit version of PC-Pine as
   of 27 Sep. 1996. For the 16-bit version, see the section on
   spell-checking in Customization and Configuration in the Pine
   Questions and Answers.)

   Pressing Ctrl-T calls up the standard spell checker, or an alternate
   program you specified in the speller variable in your configuration.
   The standard Unix spell checker reads in all the new lines of text
   (those which do not begin with the ">") and passes them through the
   spell checker. The spell checker does not provide alternative
   spellings nor does it remember correct words from session to session.

   When you first use the standard Unix spell checker, it may appear that
   it is randomly jumping all around your message - actually, the spell
   checker processes your message one word at a time, in alphabetical
   order. Other spell checkers such as ispell for Unix operate
   differently and offer more features, such as creating a personal
   "dictionary" of words.     


In other words: RTFM, young man :-)

Later,
Robin

                         X Window System

Windows is called window_S_ because it needs a second window for its

Too dumb to set up procmail? If you can post in the news, you can read

Hi, I accidentally "erased" an incoming email letter before reading it.
Are these messages stored somewhere in the system and is there a way I can
retrieve it?
Thanks

Apparently the mail-server I'm using is POP2/POP3 as opposed to standard
POP, and I was wondering if this is why Pine is unable to talk to it, is
Pine in fact compatible with these standards(!?)?

You should, as you suggest, be able to disable the keyboard lock by
putting the right value in for the feature-list setting in the fixed
configuration file.  First make sure you just have the one entry for
feature-list in the file.  Next check its value is something like this:

	feature-list=disable-busy-alarm,
	        disable-keyboard-lock-cmd,
	        disable-update-cmd

Here I also disable the spinning "busy" alarm (needed because of problems
with Pine hanging on some of our IRIX systems), and also the Update
command.  You probably won't need to do these, but I include them so you
can see what it should look like if you _do_ need to set more than one
value for the feature-list.

Cheers,

Hi -

You will need to talk to the Help Desk at your computing services (or
whoever looks after the mail system you are using).  I'm afraid that the
collection of people you're asking, sprinkled around the world at random
sites, do not know the setup and backup procedures in force at your site
(in fact I suspect the vast majority of us have never even _heard_ of your
site:-)

Cheers,

Hi -

Pine is really designed to work with "IMAP" (Internet Message Access
Protocol) rather than "POP" (Post Office Protocol) as its underlying mail
access protocol.  IMAP is, in the view of many, a much more flexible and
useful protocol:

	http://www.imap.org/imap.vs.pop.brief.html

Obviously this means that your mail system must offer an IMAP service for
you to use Pine to access your mail.  If it only offers a POP service then
you may still be access your mail providing you are using the UNIX version
of Pine; The PC version of Pine, PC-Pine, does not include the ability to
access a POP service.

You can read about setting up the UNIX version of Pine to access a POP
server in the Pine Frequesntly Asked Questions guide:

	http://www.washington.edu/pine/QandA/index.html

Cheers,

Is it me, or does this discussion group get a lot of unwanted junk mail.
Maybe we should go to a semi-moderated discussion group instead of a one
which anybody and their brother can post to.  Just a suggestion I would
like to open for discussion.

Chris.

Why copy? Pine will check the personal mailcap file and if there is no
match, proceed to the global one. BTW, you should use 
"cp /etc/mailcap ~/.mailcap".

Well, I prefer "vi ~/.mailcap" at the prompt.

It appears from the headers that the majority of the spam messages are 
coming in through the newsgroup gateway.

No, I don't want to start a flame war with further comments.... And I'm 
not going to suggest the Pine group take on moderation.  Their time can 
best be spent elsewhere :-)

Hi,
	Does anybody know if Pine support POP mail service, which is to 
retrieve mail from other mail server ?
I have an email address at other server and i want to know if there is 
any possibility to retrive mails sent to that server to my Pine email 
account. Welcome any suggestion ! 
Is it practical to use mailing list software to do the above task ?

Can anyone tell me how to do this?

I tried setting the SPELL variable to "ispell" but that didn't seem to
work correctly. Is this possible without a recompile?

Generally, you suspend a UNIX program via the keystrokes '^z' 
(Control-z), but such is not the case with Pine unless you 
configure the program to do so.

Here's how:

1. After starting 'pine', if you are not already at the Main Menu,
enter "M" in order to access the Main Main.

2. Enter "S" for Setup.

3. At the bottom of the screen you will see the following highlighted
prompt:

   Choose a setup task from the menu below :

Enter "C" for "Config".

4. To quickly and efficiently get to the "enable-suspend" feature:

   A. Enter "W" for "WhereIs"

   B. At the highlighted "Word to find :" prompt, enter "suspend"

   C. Hit the "Return" key.

5. With the following in highlight:

    [ ]  enable-suspend                        

Enter "X" in order to activate the feature.

6. Enter "E" for "Exit Config".

7. At the following highlighted prompt:
 
   "Commit changes ("Yes" replaces settings, "No" abandons changes)? "

Enter "Y" or the "Return" key for "Yes"


Note: Keep in mind that you can resume work in Pine by typing 'fg'
(no quotes) at your World prompt.

  For example,

  world%  fg

(where "world%" is an example of a shell prompt)

'fg' simply returns the suspend process to the foreground.
                                               ^   ^
