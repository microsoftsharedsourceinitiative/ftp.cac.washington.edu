Ok, someone's gotta be the a**hole... 

I suggest filtering out any mail that violates the respective RFC
concerning fake from: or other lines from the list. The use of NoSpam
headers to "thwart UCE" is not to be justified by *any*thing. If the
respective user is too lazy/thoughtless/stupid to use effective
anti-spam tools [1], they simple don't deserve an answer to any kind
of question. In my view, this means that those messages don't need to
appear on the list.

Therefore (and unless I've been tricked by my own wittiness), it would
seem more than legitimate to enforce the standards pine sets on his
users unto the mailing list: ban NoSpam-users. Someone who forges his
from: line in a way that his mail cannot be answered (remember folks?
this is what the from line is designed for...) has nothing to do on a
mailing list, anyway.

I remember reading an explanation for why the from: line cannot be
changed in pine, but I cannot find it right now. However, the following
passage from the FAQ applies just as well, because technically, there's
no difference between a not FQDN and a NoSpam-from: line, is there?
     _________________________________________________________________

 Can I eliminate the @host.domain from local addresses?

   This is not a new idea. It's a very old idea, in fact, and just
   about everyone who has ever dealt with email has had it at one time
   or another. Regretably [2], it has come to be recognized as a bad
   idea.  Here's why:

   An email address without a host name is not syntactically valid
   according to RFC822. Now, it is true that RFC822 only specifies what
   must be done in messages which are transmitted over the network, and
   that strictly local messages are not under RFC822's dictates.

   This means that there are two formats of email, one that conforms to
   RFC822 and one that does not. Careful efforts must be made to ensure
   that the non-conforming mail format never escapes the local system
   onto the network. Twenty years' of experience has shown that it is
   impossible to guarantee that the non-conforming format does not escape
   into the network, even in the face of traps to catch such messages on
   their way out and convert them to RFC822 conforming format. Indeed,
   such traps have often contributed additional problems on their own.

   The non-conforming format is ambiguous as to what host is intended.
   Although the off-the-cuff solution (and the one that everyone
   implements) is ``use the local host'', numerous examples have
   occurred in which this leads to wrong behavior. For example, it may
   be the ``local mail center'' instead of the ``local machine which
   is a single-user workstation''. Or, if a one of the non-conforming
   messages escaped on to the network, it's some remote system and we
   have no idea at all what system that may be!  There's no way for
   the mail reader to tell; a human may infer from context but often
   does so by using information that is not available to the program.

   The Pine team has spent long (and at times heated) meetings reviewing
   this issue, before coming to the conclusion (as other email groups have
   independently done) that it's a no-win situation. The policy of the
   email development community for years (since the RFC733 discussions)
   has been to exterminate the non-conforming format by not implementing
   it in modern mail tools.

   It may be feasible to implement a feature in a future version of
   Pine that would suppress the display of the local host name in
   email addresses. That is, the host name would still be in the file
   on disk, but would not show up on the screen.

     _________________________________________________________________


And just in case some smartass would like to remark that my address
isn't valid, either: I chose not to use a reply-to field on
purpose. Both addresses (r.socha@... and uzs8kb@...) are perfectly
valid. 

Later,
Robin

The workaround for systems that intercept or otherwise fail to deliver
Control-C characters to Pine is actually:  ESC ESC c
(Same idea works for any control character, btw.)

Hi, my name is Paul Valentik and I need help.
I'm an average pine user, knowing just the basics and I don't know what
to do now.
When I try to start pine it writes: floating exception to me and I
cannot get into pine, the program is not executed. Could you possibly
tell me what should I do. Our local administrator is not here at the
moment. I was doing nothing, I was not changing the configuration of
pine or something, so I don't understand why it's not working. All
happend suddenly.

Thanks for advise, Paul.

The following message is a courtesy copy of an article
that has been posted to comp.mail.pine as well.

Well, the there's extensive help on pine, but as far as I can see,
there's only html or .txt (whoever made up that silly "extension").

So I spent a good 5 minutes searching the web for books on pine,
couldn't find any; then sent a note to the Pine Guys (you there
folks???) and upon receiving only hot vapour for at least half an
hour, decided to do the Wrong Thing [tm]: I took the User Guide, the
Release Notes and the Legal Notes (all .txt), XEmacs, a few bottles
of good German beer [1] and a couple of Bratwuerste (just kidding, I
hate this stuff) and, well, spawned a monster...

	http://franck.pc.uni-koeln.de/~robin/download/

"It" is available in .tex, .ps, and .dvi format. No - wait!!! Now,
there's a pdf-file, too, for all the Windog power users...

If you thought your LaTeX sucked, well, you haven't seen mine, yet. I
could tell you how I did it, but I'd have to kill you afterwards. BTW, 
if someone out there knows how to do a ^ and a ~ properly, pls let me
know. 

If the original authors are reading this: sue my ***, the lady asked
for it...

Flamers will be shot. Money is to be sent to the Pine Guys for
providing this wonderful little program. Gnus *is* better,
though. Duh... 

If someone else has written this stuff, too, *please* let me know and
I'll link to your files. Promised!

Happy weekend and stuff...

Robin over and out...

Footnotes: 
[1]  Having been to America, I now consider this expression a
redundancy - no, not "German" and "beer". Sorry, dudes, but *brr*!

Good Day!

I would like to know the answers to the following questions:

1. Is it possible to merge two mails and send it as one mail? How?
2. Is there a way of saving the "talk" text? How?

Thanks.

Joey

And here's one for all the "no spam" lusers out there:
SpamGuard. Here's what it does:


++---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---++
As an anti-spam measure, my mail software ignores any mail without the
word "Sara" in the Subject: line, unless the sender is already on my
"no-bounce" list.  If you want to be sure that your mail reaches me,
put the word "Sara" in the Subject: line.
++---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---++

And here's how to get there:

++---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---++
To add yourself to this mailing list, send a message with the subject
of "subscribe" to spamguard-request@spconnect.com.  To obtain
additional information regarding this list and its archives, send a
message with the subject of "help" to spamguard-request@spconnect.com.
++---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---++


I think this should settle the debate about forged from: lines.

Later,
Robin

X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


This message is being sent to this mailing list weekly in order to
aid readers in finding information about Pine.  Before sending questions 
to the mailing list -- which is mirrored in the newsgroup comp.mail.pine --
please consult these resources:

The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
help.  Additional information, including a User's Guide, Technical Notes, 
Questions & Answers, where to obtain the Pine software, what tools are 
available to perform tasks that Pine itself does not, and more, can be 
accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.

     - The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
       also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection
       (from Pine's MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to
       folder-collections and choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/docs/[]
    

The messages from this mailing list/newsgroup are archived.  These archives
can be accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/
       (includes a searchable index of all archived messages, and information
        on how to subscribe to this mailing list)

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/pine-info/.

     - From within Pine by defining a folder collection (from Pine's MAIN
       MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to folder-collections and 
       choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/pine-info/[]

If you have a question about Pine, chances are it has been asked before
and you can find the answer either through the searchable index of past
messages, or among the "Questions & Answers" at the URL: 

http://www.washington.edu/pine/QandA/ 
  or
ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs/QandA.txt

If you need personal assistance with using or configuring Pine, contact
the technical support staff or computer help desk of your Internet Service
Provider, school, university, employer, ... -- whichever organization
provided you with the email account on which you are using, or planning on
using, Pine.  Because system functions and configuration can vary from
site to site, they are best qualified to assist you.  (Due to the large
number of Pine installations worldwide, the University of Washington
cannot provide individual support services to Pine users at other
organizations.)

 As I don't know the address of my local staff, I sent a message to you.
My account is full of information, so I can't use this now.  So, would you
tell me how to use this.

*yawn* 

Ok, since noone answered, I also made a cute little dvi, ps, and of
course tex file of the QandA. Anyone know how to do a \ properly? Not
that I really care (stupid Windog paths...)...

The address is still:

	http://franck.pc.uni-koeln.de/~robin/pine.html

And, yes, the layout still sucks, and, no, the devvies still haven't
seen it, and, no, they're not responsible for it, either. So if you
start whining about this crap on the list, I'll have to kick you. Huh
huh, huh, huh... [1]

Later,

FCC is the variable you're looking to set.  Sepcify sent-mail or some such
name as you like.  Mostly read the FAQ or look under the menu setup
accessible via 'm'enu 's'etup 'c'onfig and look around in that for a hint.

Yes, although quite how depends on what you're actually asking...

If you are wanting to "reply to" two or more messages, including the text
of them all in your reply then do this...

0.  From Pine's Main Menu go to the Setup Configuration screen and make
sure that the "enable-aggregate-command-set" option is selected.  Exit
from this screen, saving any changes.  This enables the Select, Apply and
Zoom commands which work in the Folder Index screen.

1.  Go to the Index screen of the folder containing the messages you want
to reply to.

2.  Pick the messages you want to merge into one reply by giving the
Select (;) command.  Check the command menu at the bottom of the screen
for selection options; also read its context-sensitive help.  If you
already have some messages selected you can add to or narrow your
selection by giving further Select (;) commands.

3.  Once you have the relevant messages selected use the Apply (A) command
to apply a Reply (R) to the entire selection.  This will let you include
the text of tall the selected messages in your reply.

HOWEVER, if what you wanted to know was how to merge two or more message
texts stored in files into a message then do this:

1.  Start composing a message.

2.  Put the cursor in the Message Text area where you want to include the
contents of one of your files.

3.  Give the Read File (^R) command and select the file whose content you
want to include.

4.  Repeat 2-3 as necessary.

> 2. Is there a way of saving the "talk" text? How?

I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you're asking here.  What do you
mean by "talk" text?  (If you are referring to the UNIX "talk" facility
for intereactive chat then I'm confused: Pine is a mail program, not a
"talk" program.  It does not let you "talk" to others; at best it can be
configured to allow talk connection requests to breakthrough to your
screen so that you know someone is trying to talk to you.  You then quit
or suspend Pine and use a talk program to reply.)

Cheers,

I have had people send me an attached file and tell me in their message.
I went to the prompt where I usually down load and there was the file.
How can I do this using pine.
Also ctrl r is read a file.Then ask me for the location and file name.
Can you explain more about this to me.
Thank You

Hello my name is Rolf Gienger

I use Pine for Windows NT. When i create a new message, in subjectline and 
body all spaces are interpreted as a linefeed sign. Here an example for 
this feature:

After
all
words
there
is
a
LF

When i press the strg (ctrl) button at beginning pico is O.K.

Does anyone know a solution for this problem.

Thanks for all

Rolf

recently moved my work site but copied my .pinerc folder here so nothing
has changed in my configuration. However, when I bounce mail back to the
list [as moderator, this puts their header on the message], it now
includes all the heretofore invisible header information in the message.
The system at this site is different. It is a linux system. How do I
eliminate the internal header infomation from my messages to the
listserver by adjusting the config in pine?  Is there a fix for this. To
forward the mail back to the listserver only puts my address in the
listserver header which confuses my subscribers.

... and the next one. Since the developers all seem to be dead (or
maybe they've all killfiled me, hehehe), I've LaTeXed the Secrets.txt, 
too.

The book now has some 112 pages, so I seem to be getting somewhere.

You can get the files from the usual address. If someone out there
knows their TeX, please check the source and let me know what could be 
done better---or maybe: what could not be done any worse, and I'll
reverse engineer the thing.

hello, i'm in buenos aires, argentina. have the same problem barry has:
i'm quoting him:

"I've started receiving mail containing two parts.  The first part is
usually a few lines of ASCII text.  The second part is about 2.9KB
long and PINE 3.91 identifies it as application/MS-TNEF.  The only
thing I can do with the second part is save it to a file.  The headers
show that the sender is using Microsoft Mail.  I asked someone who
sent me such a message what he was doing.  He was a computer novice
and didn't know.  Several messages from him had the attachment and
several didn't.  He didn't indicate he had done anything different
when sending the mail without the attachment.

So, what is the MS-TNEF attachment?  Why is it called an application?
What causes it to be sent?  Is it necessary?  If not, how can it be
avoided?

Thanks,
Barry"

please tell what can i do. need to know how to read the
"application/ms-tnef". thanks a lot,
	pablo

Sir,

I have the e-mail facility since two months.  As I am a stranger to 
the e-mail and internet word, I find it little difficult to understand and 
use this. 

If you could guide me how to learn I would be greatful to you.

Thanking you,


Gopalakrishna M.N.

It's a virus. It's a message from Satan, too. You need to read it
backwards: FENT-SM. See? It's a message from Gill Bates, so you've got
to be very careful. Maybe your computer has been infected already.

p> Why is it called an application?

Because it applies dangerous stuff to your system, like fatal protection
errors, memory leaks, Winword and so on.

If we knew, we'd try to find a cure. Right now, we don't know,
but we're working on it.

No.

p> If not, how can it be avoided?

You need to clean your hard disk. Boot from a clean floppy and type:

	format c: /u /backup

If you're getting strange messages like "all your data will be lost",
your system has been infected already. Don't listen to that stuff. Go
ahead and reformat your hard disk. It's the only save way to prevent
the FENT-SM virus from spreading to other systems.

I'm not sure that helps, but...

Well, sometime truth is stranger than fiction, and then again fiction
can become an "Urban Legion".  I think Robin has the makings for a good
one.  :-)

Anyway, MS-TNEF is a Mirosoft creation.  It is a propietary Rich Text
format which MSMail understands/creates which allow you to send bold
text, color text, etc..  

Is it necessary?  Certainly not.

The sender can avoid sending it by looking over the options menu in their
MSMail setup.  Somewhere in there is a check-box which will diable sending
of the MS-TNEF piece.  It is unchecked by default.

Sorry I can't be more explicit as to where the box is to be found.   I
never intentionally use any Microsoft products.  I only use them out of
necessity.

I presume Ed actually means "Urban Legend"?

That said, it is interesting to note that "Urban Legion" is an anagram of
"urbane lingo"... 

    urbane: Having imperturbable good manners, suave, courteous
    lingo:  Language

A suitable description for the Robin Socha we all know and love?  I leave
you to decide!  (Hi, Robin! ;-)

Isn't it interesting how things turn out even funnier than you intended?

Thanks's Mike.  Now I can face my 17 hour flight back to Taipei with a

Is there anyone using the PC Pine client with PGP?  We at UNM use Pine and
would like to add encryption to the product.  Any help would be
appreciated.

Sure. First, try saying the following at your u*ix prompt:
	
	man pine

and read it.

Then go to pine's M(ain) screen and say ?. Also, there's plenty of
help available on each other screen of pine.

Then check this address here for further information on-line:

	http://www.washington.edu/pine

and if you need the stuff in a format that looks nice when printed,
check my infamous website, too:

Make sure to read the disclaimer!

I have pine 3.91 installed on a Solaris 2.5.1 server.  The pine client is
creating a userid@host X-sender header for all outgoing e-mail.  Can
anyone tell me how to prevent the creation of X-sender mail headers?

Hi,

When I go into PINE Setup for Printer and choose option 3 (Personally
selected print command), I enter PRINT/QUE=CS1$PRINT or
PRINT/QUE=REC$PRINT to print messages to a VMS print queue.  This
functions correctly until I exit PINE.

When I reinvoke PINE the Printer Setup in option 3 is changed to 
PRINT/QUE=CS1 or PRINT/QUE=REC.

It appears as though PINE sees the $ and cuts off the rest of the
command.

Is this a bug? Any solutions?

Thanks!

I believe the sender field is created by your mail server (sendmail).  If
you have root access to the machine, you can send mail as root, and it
should trust you.  Otherwise, it's there as a security feature - you can't
get rid of it - that is the point... :)

Subject: errors, linux + 3.96
Content-Type: text

X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Hi,
I am getting this error on a Linux machine: 2.0.30
This is Pine 3.96.

(from ~/.pine-debug1)

output_message(Sending mail     )
STATUS cmd:120, max:1, min0
call_mailer: via pipe
Opening pipe: "/usr/sbin/sendmail -bs -odb -oem" (WRNP)
PID: 26617, COMMAND: /usr/sbin/sendmail -bs -odb -oem
SIGCHLD raised
alarm_signal()
alarm_signal()

These are the last entries logged, I compiled with level 9 logging for debugging
 purposes.

/usr/sbin/sendmail exists and is of the proper permissions.  When running it fro
m the 
command line, it works fine.
Has anyone else seen this?  I have sendmail 8.8.7 running, and it is working in 
all other
aspects, no troubles at all.

Could this be something with the Linux system's flock/malloc calls?  Something b
roken with
that?  I had libc.so.5.3.12 installed, and was getting some odd errors concernin
g the
parsing and writing to the .pinerc file.  I installed libc.so.5.4.33, and that p
roblem went away.
However, the original problem (above) still exists.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance!

We currently use this format with mail folders since it works with file
based programs like mailtool/dtmail and elm but also with IMAP .

Programs like elm always have the SMTP sender in the From_ line at the
start of each mail item in local folders, but when an item is saved by
pine from a user's INBOX, the recipient is used in place of the SMTP
sender.

I have looked at the pine technical notes and can't find anything I can add
which "fixes" this behaviour. Have I missed something?

I realise that the SMTP sender information may not be available via
IMAP2bis but does pine have to do things this way? I'm asking because it
breaks some post processing some people do here (Yes we can probably fix
these programs but it's simpler if pine can do what elm does now).

Thank you.

Dear Sirs:
I would like to know how one can use the window clip board function in the
Pine mail system when the mail message is longer than a single screen. How
can one copy more than one page at one time?

I have a serious problem in using Pine when I dial up to my host. Very
often the key strokes are misinterpreted hence causing grave errors.
Partly the problem may be due line speed, sometimes I do get very slow
response hence every keystroke or single command will take many seconds to
get a response (I am investigating with the phone company on this) but the
misinterpretation of keystrokes may be a different problem. Can you
suggest any clues?
Thanks.
Ifay

After I upgraded to Pine 3.96 and ran the Linux Slackware setup script,
my locked INBOX problem disappeared.  Thanks to all who helped, and Bravo
to the programmers who developed the enhancements to this version.

I'd just like to say this program has literally saved my relationship with
my boyfriend.  As I met him when he was in Australia on exchange, he then
went home back to America just one short month ago.  We ring each other on
a regular basis, but are limited in how often and how long we talk as it
costs $1 per minute.  

The pine program has saved our relationship, as I mentioned before.
Without it we wouldn't be able to communicate as often as we do and in as
much detail.  I live on campus at my University and the program is offered
free of charge to the students.  I am forever grateful and thankful for
the easy use, the level of intelligence, the efficency and effectiveness
of this program, that my boyfriend and I rely so dependantly on.

                       Thankyou, Thankyou, Thankyou!

One way is to select all the messages in a folder
   ; (to select)  then A (to select ALL [in a folder]) then S for Save in
the usual manner.

Hopefully there is a better way

Subject: WHERE TO FIND INFORMATION ABOUT PINE
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


This message is being sent to this mailing list weekly in order to
aid readers in finding information about Pine.  Before sending questions 
to the mailing list -- which is mirrored in the newsgroup comp.mail.pine --
please consult these resources:

The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
help.  Additional information, including a User's Guide, Technical Notes, 
Questions & Answers, where to obtain the Pine software, what tools are 
available to perform tasks that Pine itself does not, and more, can be 
accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.

     - The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
       also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection
       (from Pine's MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to
       folder-collections and choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/docs/[]
    

The messages from this mailing list/newsgroup are archived.  These archives
can be accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/
       (includes a searchable index of all archived messages, and information
        on how to subscribe to this mailing list)

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/pine-info/.

     - From within Pine by defining a folder collection (from Pine's MAIN
       MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to folder-collections and 
       choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/pine-info/[]

If you have a question about Pine, chances are it has been asked before
and you can find the answer either through the searchable index of past
messages, or among the "Questions & Answers" at the URL: 

http://www.washington.edu/pine/QandA/ 
  or
ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs/QandA.txt

If you need personal assistance with using or configuring Pine, contact
the technical support staff or computer help desk of your Internet Service
Provider, school, university, employer, ... -- whichever organization
provided you with the email account on which you are using, or planning on
using, Pine.  Because system functions and configuration can vary from
site to site, they are best qualified to assist you.  (Due to the large
number of Pine installations worldwide, the University of Washington
cannot provide individual support services to Pine users at other
organizations.)

Hi guys!

Is there a version of PINE which will allows messages which are being
composed to be automatically saved at regular intervals?

We have had a number of users recently who have lost large messages for
one reason or another, and have been quite disgruntled to find that they
have to type the whole thing in again.

I've had a look through the help files in our version, and I can't see any
mention of such a feature. Can anyone help?

When composing a message, CTRL-C dosen't work.

Also, I get an "incomplete return mail address" error each time I start
pine. How is this fixed?

HOW DO WE RE-DOWNLOAD THE PINE VERSION THAT WORKS?

Hey Man,  we have been developing software for some 15 years.
NEVER have I seen such sloppiness in work.
CTRL_C Dosen't work.
Nobody checks these things?

Now, how do I get the old version of pine back? Or barring that, who will 
fix this mess?

Ahhhhh netscape is looking better and better....

CTRL-C works fine on our UNIX system running 3.96 Pine.
What version of Pine are you using and on what platform?

I am preparing to move a set of users to PINE but haven't got 
either the software or the documentation.

Please could I ask if someone could kindly send me an example of a
well-featured  properly constructed aliases definition file for 
PINE.  I believe that this would be plain text and thus
suitable for e-mailing, but I don't know much else about the format.

I would particularly like to be able to see a definition which shows
that the defined resolution addresses may be aliases upon which PINE 
may be expected to perform further lookup.

Please send any response to me directly (jw34@liverpool.ac.uk) rather
than distributing it to the list.

Oh yes, and I *promise* not to use any sent example for sending
mail back to any of the listed resolution addresses:)

You may have been developing software for "some" 15 years but you seem
unaware how to report problems with software.  If someone were to report
this as an error to SW you developed without giving full information as
to the platform and version being used....what would your answer be?

Oh, BTW, chances are very good that the control-c problem you are
experiencing is not the fault of pine but with your terminal emulation SW,
or shell, interpreting and acting upon the control-c and *not* passing it
to pine.

So, if you can calm down long enough to send folks a complete description
of your environment....someone may be able to enlighten you.

Have you had your perscription checked recently?  :-) :-)

		Hello,
	I've got problems with Pine. I'm using several different systems,
so I'll be specific.
	First, my computer is a 486 dx 100 mhz with 16 megs of ram,
running Dos 6.22 and Windows 3.1. I'm using a dosbased telecommunications
program, called {Commo} to get to where I need to go.
	Alright, first situation. I use {Commo} in conjunction with a
telnet app to go to my College, where they have a shell account, running
Pine. I try to compose to a news group, but whenever I press enter to
advance to the next line, it asks me for a file to attach, of course, I
don't want this, so I hit control c, but it keeps asking me this, and
won't let me do anything else, there version of Pine is 3.93.
	Second situation, I'm telneting to my ISP, to get on there pine.
There using version 3.95. I type in pine, but I get ppiinnee instead and
it says that it doesn't recognize my terminal.
	You may be wondering why I don't just get pc-pine and be done
with it. Well, I did, one for a dos packet driver, it was difficult to
find one. Whenever I use it, it says that it can't open my inbox, no such
folder. Then it says, when I change the inbox from {} to [] invalid
specification. It also says I can't send messages without an open remote
folder.
	I've included my pinerc file, my current wattcp.cfg file, and how
it was by default

# Updated by Pine(tm) 3.96, copyright 1989-1996 University of Washington.
#
# Pine configuration file -- customize as needed.
#
# This file sets the configuration options used by Pine and PC-Pine.  If
you
# are using Pine on a Unix system, there may be a system-wide
configuration
# file which sets the defaults for these variables.  There are comments
in
# this file to explain each variable, but if you have questions about
# specific settings see the section on configuration options in the Pine
# notes.  On Unix, run pine -conf to see how system defaults have been
set.
# For variables that accept multiple values, list elements are separated
# by commas.  A line beginning with a space or tab is considered to be a
# continuation of the previous line.  For a variable to be unset its
value
# must be blank.  To set a variable to the empty string its value should
# be "".  You can override system defaults by setting a variable to the
# empty string.  Switch variables are set to either "yes" or "no", and
# default to "no".
# Lines beginning with "#" are comments, and ignored by Pine.

Maybe you should get the prog and the docs first. If you're thinking
of Elm or *urgh* Eudora alias files, those can be converted to the
pine addressbook format. Install pine and take a look at the online
help and the dotfiles. That should help.

Distribution lists? All explained in the docs.

And, no, I'm not going to do the reading for you. Reading is fun.

Later,

Netscape. His answer would be Netscape, because "CTRL_C" works
beautifully in Netscape.

Does hitting over the head with a burning Dos95-box count as
"enlightenment", too?

EMG> Have you had your perscription checked recently?  :-)

Yeah, right. Here's some stuff from the documentation, too:

Pico:
  Editing commands are entered using controlkey combinations.  As a
  work-around for communications programs that swallow certain control
  characters, you can emulate a control key by pressing ESCAPE twice,
  followed by the desired control character, e.g. "ESC ESC c" would be
  equivalent to entering a ctrl-c.

Unlike regular u*ix programs, pine cannot be killed by hitting C-c,
either. Maybe this is what gets our young friend so confused. However, 
this is mentioned in the FAQ, too.

Robin

Subject: editing incoming messages in pine
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Hi,
   I have been trying to figure out how to edit incoming messages
in pine.  I have tried a number of things like pipe but it hasn't
worked.  When I pipe to vi I get: 
   PIPE MESSAGE Result: VIM: no controlling terminal
   when I pipe to pico I get a screen that is scrambled and I need
to Exit to get back to the message list.  I have also looked at the FAQs
and the source code.
   What I really want to do is someting like the v command in
shell based mail.  I want to be able to edit an incoming message to
perhaps get rid of some of the extraneous quoted material, or change
the subject line so it's more relevant when I save it.
   One way to accomplish what I want is to get out of pine, start
up mail, edit the messages, get out of mail, and restart pine.  That's
a mess.
   I should mention that I'm running pine 3.95 on linux.
   I am not a regular reader of the newsgroup/mailing list so if
people could respond directly to me I would appreciated it.  I will
summarize to the list.

   Thanks,
   Barry

If you check the archives, this "awesome" fellow has been trying to use
PC-pine with POP3.  He has been told numerous times that PC-pine does not
support POP3.  Terry Gray told him PC-pine does not support POP3.  

Maybe "awesome" doesn't mean what it should in his case?

Since I have had the same thing happen to me here and there I can
recommend what I usually do: postponing the message with ctrl-o and then
getting back into it with ctrl-c.  If anything happens thereafter, usually
your postponed copy will have the most recent draft of your letter,
obviously depending on when you last postponed it.

hope I helped,

hi anyone,

is there a kind person who can direct me (i'm not too literate in
unix commands) in my quest, which is to move my current pine folders from
one account to another, intact?

thanks for your input.

Depends on what OS is running on the other account. Basically,
something like:

	tar -czf ~/mail.old.tgz ~/mail (or Mail)
	mcopy ~/mail.old a:

should do the trick, along with a 
	
	tar -xzf mail.old.tgz

on the other account.

HTH,
Robin

And since the subject's been raised, may I take this opportunity
to thank the Pine development team for this feature?

It's elevated me to guru status with more than a few users who

This sounds as if your terminal emulator might be sending both a Carriage
Return (CR) and Line Feed (LF) character whenever you press the return
key.

Pine interprets CR as "start a new line", and LF (which is the same as
Ctrl/J) as either "Attach a file" (if your cursor is on a header line in
the Compose Message screen) or "Justify" (if your cursor is in the message
text area instead).

Try checking your terminal emulator to see if there is some option to
select between CR or CR+LF when the return key is pressed.

By the way, I think I have seen this referred to as "Berkeley 4.3 CR Mode"
in NCSA Telnet on the Macintosh (I have this turned _off_), so you may
find it hiding under some not terribly obvious name like this one.

By the way the current version of Pine (both UNIX and PC variants) is
3.96.  Try and get your 3.93 version upgraded.

This is because you have got "local echo" turned on in your terminal
emulator program.  "Local Echo" means that whenever you press a key your
terminal emulator displays the character on the screen as well as sending
it to the UNIX host.  In a normal configuration the UNIX host echoes
received characters back to the terminal, which then displays it again:
hence the double characters.

One solution would be to turn off this remote echoing.  However this is
not a standard way of working these days and may break other programs.

Instead you should stop your terminal emulator echoing the character
locally.  Look through its menu options/configuration file and turn off
the local echo option.

By the way...

Because you are seeing this problem at the UNIX command line prompt you
should have deduced that it is therefore nothing to do with Pine (which
isn't even running yet).  Instead it is affecting your whole UNIX session
and hence is obviusly either a problem with your computerhardware/software
setup, or that of your ISP.  In either case the Pine forum is not an
appropriate place to sort this one out; you should have contacted your ISP
for help (after you're paying them! :-)

> and it says that it doesn't recognize my terminal.

This might be caused by the "local echo" being turned on, causing the UNIX
host not to be able to figure out what sort of terminal you are using.

However usually the terminal type information is passed in a different way
to normal typed input, so I suspect this problem _won't_ be due to local
echo being turned on. 

Instead it is probably because the terminal type that your terminal
emulator specified/negotiated with your ISP account when you logged in
isn't one that Pine understands. 

Check this as follows... Straight after logging in try displaying the
terminal type that your UNIX command shell thinks you're using: 

	echo $TERM

If this is unset, or is set to something obscure then Pine (and perhaps
many other programs) won't know what escape sequences to send to control
the screen, and so complain about an unknown terminal type.

Usually this option is set by the local Telnet program on your computer.
For example the copy of NCSA Telnet on my Mac allows you to select either
VT100 or VT220 emulation; it then informs the UNIX system which one you
are using as you connect to it.

If you need further help on getting your Telnet program configured to use
a sensible terminal emulation please speak to your ISP's Help Desk.

There are two problems here:

1.  The correct syntax for the inbox-path variable is:

	inbox-path={pop.example.net/pop3}INBOX

Note the use of curlies (braces) rather than squares (brackets).

The "folder-collections" variable requires a "placeholder" instead of a
particular filder name.  This placeholder is the character sequence "[]",
thus:

	folder-collections={pop.example.net/pop3}[]

2.  The second problem is that the above won't work either!  This is
because no version of PC-Pine yet supports POP access.  It instead _must_
connect to an IMAP server to access your mail.

POP and IMAP are very different protocols; your ISP may offer one, the
other, or both.  You will need to check with them if they offer an IMAP
service.  If they do then you will need to find out from them the IP name
of the machine it is running on and replace the machine names in the above
examples with it (and delete the "/pop" qualifier too!).

If your ISP doesn't offer an IMAP service then PC-Pine is not currently an
option for you.

> It also says I can't send messages without an open remote folder. 

This is correct.  PC-Pine requires you to prove who you are by having you
first login to the IMAP server with a username and password.  This
authentication step proves that you are "you".  PC-Pine then includes this
authenticiation information (minus the password!) in any messages you
send.  This is a laudable effort to try and help reduce mail forging on
the Internet. 

Cheers,

Ummm...

The "alternate editor" configuration setting certainly allows you to use a
different editor for outgoing messages.  However Barry was asking about
editing _incoming_ ones.

As far as I recall tyhere is no option within Pine to allow you to edit an
incoming message in situ (within its folder) like, for example, Elm can. 
This greatly reduces the chances of a user accidentally corrupting their
mail folder.

If you want to save an edited copy "out of" Pine and edit there you can do
so by using the Export (E) command to get a copy of the message saved out
of Pine to a file in your home directory (or wherever).  You can then leave
or suspend Pine to edit it.  (Note that you probably can't get the edited
message back into a folder using Pine.  Or if you can then I wouldn't rely
on it always working forevermore!)

Cheers,

   I have tried this and that will take care of the subject and extraneous
quoting.  However, there is one other thing I want to accomplish and that
is to also edit the header so it shows who really sent the message.  I
get alot of mailing list email which has the list address in the From:
line.  I like to edit this to have the real author listed there.
   It seems like this should be doable.  Shell mail can do this with the
v command, and clearly, any X windows based mailtool can do this also.
However, I like other features of pine.  I have looked at the source code
to try to add an option but I couldn't figure out exactly how to do it.

   THanks,
   Barry

Dear someone,

Every time I go to compose an email message, my message text is filled
with a part of a previous letter that I have written.

I have to erase this text each and every time befor I can write a new
email message.

Can you please tell me how to get rid of this plague.

Thanks, AL at   azz@freenet.edmonton.ab.ca

Turn on rich header mode before exporting.

Hello, I'm trying to compile pine for dg/ux and I've had problems with
the mail.h file.... it shows an error on line 519 and 520 like this:

     cc -g -DNFSKLUDGE  -c mail.c
In file included from mail.c:39:
mail.h:519: syntax error before `char'
mail.h:520: syntax error before `char'
In file included from mail.c:43:

rfc822.h:104: parse error before `const'
mail.c:1080: syntax error before `char'
mail.c:1082: syntax error before `char'

The mail.h file in those lines looks like:

  517  /* Other symbols */
   518
   519   extern const char *days[];     /* day name strings */
   520   extern const char *months[];   /* month name strings */
   521
   522
   523  /* Jacket into external interfaces */
   524
   525  typedef long (*readfn_t) (void *stream,unsigned long size,char
*buffer);
   526  typedef char *(*mailgets_t) (readfn_t f,void *stream,unsigned
long size)
;

Do someone knows what's happening??? I was looking in the ancient files
but I didn't find an answer....

Thanks in advance....

Do  someone knows where can I find pine binaries for dg/ux 5.4.3.1???

hi developer people:

i am looking for a way to toggle back and forth between a message i am
writing, and a message i am responding to.  i do not want to include
the original message in my response, and i do not want to postpone the
message i am composing: postponing is too inefficient when you are
repeatedly going back and forth, and including the original message is
inefficent when the original message is really long.  i simple want to be
able to toggle back and forth, preferably with a control charachter.
is this possible?  the support staff at my institution says all i can do
is include or postpone.  please help!  thanks.  nancy evans

Nancy,

Ask your support staff if they have either "Screen" or "Facetterm".
This lets you open more than one "window" at a time and lets you run different
apps in different "windows". It's like having 2 terminals on your desk but you
only have one and you can toggle back and forth between the screens.

However, I don't think you can open up two pine sessions at once without
locking them up.

You would have to save (export) you orginal message as a file, and then refer
back to that file while you were replying to the message in pine.

Perhaps some other readers on this group have another work around.

I think that we are all looking over a real easy way. Just print 
out the message that you want to refer to and then recycle it once your 
done using it.

Is it possible to set up an automatic repsonse to messages received, that
can be used when a user is away for a period of time?

I already know that one should Unsubscribe to any mailing lists!

I believe this subject may have been raised on this forum sometime ago,
but cAn't find it in my saved messages or the help list.  Thank you.

This is not a function of pine itself.  You need to set this up from your
Unix account.  On many systems this is accomplished via the "vacation"
program.  Try typing "man vacation" for details on its use.

Not really.  One should use something like "procmail" and have the mailing
list traffic sorted into different folders so you can browse them at your
leasure.  This way you don't "miss" anything.

It was probably discussed during the time you were unsubscribed.  :-)

What happens if you press control-L ?  Does that put the screen right?

It's possible that this is a bug in the version of Pine you are using
(which is not the latest), or a problem in configuration of your termcap
or terminfo database or terminal emulator.  You might ask if others at
your site have the same problem, and if not, what's different about their
setup.

Please tell me how I can solve the problem regarding not being able to
receive incoming e-mail.

When selecting Pine, I receive the message "Return address in mail you
send may be incorrect."  

I have had a friend write to me with the both my correct address and that
which appears on my mail when I use Pine;  neither are received.

After using Pine to successfully send mail many times, today, for the
first time, the Bug Report appeared with your address as one of the
suggested options.

I look forward to your reply.

Sincerely,
Cynthia Landriz

Go to the Interguru mail conversion page at

The Interguru is Joseph Davidson in real life, and these scripts
are a wonderful tool.

I have quite a few files in my unix home directory.  Is it possible to mv
all my pine folders into a subdirectory <pine_folders> without losing any
information or causing problems?

I have about ten folders in my Pine config set-up.  I'd like to reorder
them. If I delete one and insert another would that cause difficulties, eg
loss of files?

Thank you - John de Boer

Subject: WHERE TO FIND INFORMATION ABOUT PINE
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


This message is being sent to this mailing list weekly in order to
aid readers in finding information about Pine.  Before sending questions 
to the mailing list -- which is mirrored in the newsgroup comp.mail.pine --
please consult these resources:

The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
help.  Additional information, including a User's Guide, Technical Notes, 
Questions & Answers, where to obtain the Pine software, what tools are 
available to perform tasks that Pine itself does not, and more, can be 
accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.

     - The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
       also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection
       (from Pine's MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to
       folder-collections and choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/docs/[]
    

The messages from this mailing list/newsgroup are archived.  These archives
can be accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/
       (includes a searchable index of all archived messages, and information
        on how to subscribe to this mailing list)

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/pine-info/.

     - From within Pine by defining a folder collection (from Pine's MAIN
       MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to folder-collections and 
       choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/pine-info/[]

If you have a question about Pine, chances are it has been asked before
and you can find the answer either through the searchable index of past
messages, or among the "Questions & Answers" at the URL: 

http://www.washington.edu/pine/QandA/ 
  or
ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs/QandA.txt

If you need personal assistance with using or configuring Pine, contact
the technical support staff or computer help desk of your Internet Service
Provider, school, university, employer, ... -- whichever organization
provided you with the email account on which you are using, or planning on
using, Pine.  Because system functions and configuration can vary from
site to site, they are best qualified to assist you.  (Due to the large
number of Pine installations worldwide, the University of Washington
cannot provide individual support services to Pine users at other
organizations.)

Err...

1. This is a list for the email program pine.
2. "login incorrect" means you're having the same spelling problems as 
   in your mail while logging in.
3. If you can access the files - what's wrong with that?

Finally: 
use the words "bug report" with caution

talk to your local help desk

get yourself a copy of the netiquette and make sure to read and
understand it before posting

HTH,
Robin

Rohn,

Have you upgraded to Pine 3.96?  If so, do you still see the hangs?

Thanks for the report!

Pretty easy: try saying

emacs -f gnus or xemacs -f gnus

and make sure to pay a visit to my website to grab the dotfiles >;->
In other words: Pine cannot do that. You can invoke another editor,
though, and do it manually. Vi seems the best choice for that. Ick.

Later,

is there in Pine a command that will print a foldername in full.

for eaxmple to save an email to a particular folder called, well, lets
say: Clinton's love affairs.

I've tapped down to that collection of folders called, say: FamousPeople.

then, either from memory or by invoking ^T i get to see the list of
folders in that collection, and then I need to either select "Clinton love
affairs" etc  OR select it.  

Well, it would be a lot easier if I needed merely to type C and then type,
say [tab]  as we do in UNIX for the name to be typed in full.

2---For that matter is there an esier way of selecting the collection of
folders than tapping 12 or more downarows before getting to the wanted
collection/

thank you

ps is there someone glued up on unix who might assist with finding or
confirming some basic Unix commands - for pvt discussion. Hey is there a
unix List?

Sweet honeybee.

Create files in your home account eg sig1, sig2, sig3 ....sig10 Each
one being a poem. In your Pine sig file have just, say, your name only. 
 After composing your email, then invoke ^R and select the particular SigN
(poem) you want for the occasion. Voila.

What OS locally? If u*ix, grab a pop client like popclient or
fetchmail or whatever. Mucho easy.

Otherwise type in your user ID (should be tombell) and the password
you received from your ISP.

Talk to your local help desk.

Later,
Robin

Honestly, I don't get your problem... Do you want to respond to the
person below, or do you want to take his address and write to him?

1. To respond, say "r" while in the message screen.
2. To take the address, say "t" as in TakeAdr.

Sa'idon,
Robin

Read the netiquette first (and probably stuff like this: Shapiro,
Norman, et al. "Towards an Ethics and Etiquette for Electronic Mail".,
Santa Monica, CA: Rand Corporation (publication R-3283-NSF/RC), 1985.

Then check deja news for a posting by me. You'll want to use a script
to create random sigs with a sending filter.

This sig in particular is _*TOO LONG*_, though.

Later,
Robin

We had the same problem here.  Win95's telnet doesn't pass certain printer
control characters so messages won't print when you press "y".

Find and download EWAN Telnet off the net.  It's a _little_ tricky to
setup, but you'll be printing messages again in no time!

	Help!  I've sent a fairly long message and then noticed that the
address was wrong.  While I am able to view the message, I haven't been
able to edit the error. Can this be done and if so how? 
	Also, every piece of mail I have sent or received has been stored
(automatically it seems).  I've tried to delete them but to no avail.  How
can I erase them?

If you've already sent it and it bounced back to you, view it again
and say "b" to bounce, then insert the correct address.

By d(eleting) and (e)x(punging) them. Check the help on "aggregate

check out pine's online help... 

Later,

Subject: Multiple Address Books
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Using PINE V3.95 on a UNIX system, I have found several references to the
use of multiple address books.  However, I have been unable to determine
exactly how to set one up, and how to transfer addresses from one address
book to another.  I have printed and read "General Information onf the
PINE Message System", "Secrets of Pine 3.9", "Release Notes for Pine
(3.95), and browsed the web site.  The online help for Address Book
Commands mentions the Pine Technical Notes document (included in the Pine
distribution), but I have been unable to locate this document.  

I would greatly appreciate your help before I somehow manage to loose many
of my addresses by trying to transfer them.

Thanks!

Address Books

   The address book file is named, by default, .addressbook in the user's
   Unix home directory, or in the case of PC-Pine, ADDRBOOK, in the save
   directory as the PINERC file. There may be more than one address book,
   and the default name can be over-ridden via an entry in any of the
   Pine configuration files. The two configuration variables address-book
   and global-address-book are used to specify the file names of the
   address books. Each of these variables is a list variable. The total
   set of address books for a user is the combination of all the address
   books specified in these two lists. Each entry in the list is an
   optional nickname followed by a file name. The nickname is everything
   up to the last space before the file name. The global-address-book
   list will typically be configured in the system-wide configuration
   file, though a user may over-ride it like most other variables.
   Address books which are listed in the global-address-book variable are
   forced read-only, and are typically shared among multiple users.

BP> and how to transfer addresses from one address book to another.

   Address books are simple text files with lines in the format:
   
     <nickname>TAB<fullname>TAB<address>TAB<fcc>TAB<comments>
     
   The last two fields are optional. A "line" may be made up of multiple
   actual lines in the file by using continuation lines, which are lines
   beginning with SPACE characters. The line breaks may be after TABS or
   in between addresses in a distribution list.
   
And so on ... It's pretty simple. Take your favourite editor (or two
xterms to cut and paste between) and hack away. To make sure you don't 
lose any addresses, do:

	mkdir ~/.Secure
	cp ~/.addressbook* ~/.Secure

provided your alternate addressbooks are all called .addressbook.foo.

BP> The online help for Address Book Commands mentions the Pine
BP> Technical Notes document (included in the Pine distribution), but
BP> I have been unable to locate this document.

It's in the source distribution.

Hello my name is Murali Tupuri.

When ever i send a mail using pine, receiver cant use directly reply 
command from their mailer tools directly coz of my e_mail (senders) 
e_mail address getting changed.

For example my e_mal id is murali@trinc.com but at the receiver side it 
is going as murali@ipx@trinc.com btw, ipx is my mail server machine name.

I would really appreciate if u solve the problem. Btw, all i have is pine 
binary for my Sun machine.

Dave,
   Sorry to be so long on this.  Yes, we are still seeing hangups on 3.96,
although the number of people using the software that is prone to this
(PC-KERMIT) is dwindling, so complaints have tailed off -- I think most of
the complaining users are still using Pine 3.93, which does not have the
problem.  I can also simulate the problem under Digital UNIX by using
7-bit vt300 mode on a dxterm (I am away from my office as I write this, so
it might be 8-bit mode --- I will verify when I get back to campus).


Thanks for your attention to this matter.

This may not be a bug, but my account does not recieve any messages from
anyone.  I can send messages to anyone but replies are not entered into
my folder.  I've already changed my password and have gotten a new
account just recently and ever since then the problen has begun.
  
I can't seem to find the problem so any help would be appreciated.
Thank you.

Hi!

I would like to know how to save e-mails into a different folder at the
end of  each
month?  Before (older verison of PIne) I used to be prompted after each
month and the e-mails would automatically be placed in their own monthly
folder.  Now, they all stay in the same folder.


Thanks


Trevor Demayo

Subject: Virus Alert

Someone at work posted a message about viruses transmitted via email.  I
thought I'd send this alert out to everyone I know.  It came from America
Online so some of you may have already heard about them.


WARNING !!!!! If your receive an email titled "JOIN THE CREW" DO NOT open
it!    It will erase EVERYTHING on your hard drive!  This is a relatively
new virus and not many people may know about it so pass the word on.

If anyone receives mail entitled: PENPAL GREETINGS! delete it at once
without reading it!!  This is a warning for all Internet users - there is a
dangerous virus propagating across the Internet through an email message
entitled "PENPAL GREETINGS".

DO NOT DOWNLOAD ANY MESSAGE ENTITLED "PENPAL GREETINGS!"
This message appears to be a friendly letter asking you if you are
interested in a penpal, but by the time you read this letter, it is too
late.  The trojan horse virus will have already infected the boot sector of
your hard drive, destroying all of the data present.  It is a
self-replicating virus, and once the message is read, it will AUTOMATICALLY
forward itself to anyone who's email address is present in YOUR mailbox.
This virus will destroy your hard drive, and holds the potential to destroy
the hard drive of anyone whose mail is in your in-box, and whose mail is in
their in-box and so on.  If this virus keeps getting passed, it has the
potential to do a great deal of damage to computer networks worldwide.

Please, delete the message entitled "PENPAL GREETINGS!" as soon as you see
it!  And pass this message along to all of your friends, relatives and
other readers of the newsgroups and mailing lists which you are on so that
they are not hurt by this dangerous virus!!!

DO NOT open or even look at any mail that you get that says: "Returned or
Unable to Deliver"  This virus will attach itself to your computer
components and render them useless.  Immediately delete any mail items that
say this.  AOL has said this is a very dangerous virus, and there is NO
remedy for it at this time.  Pleas Be Careful and forward to all your
on-line friends ASAP

Is there any way that you can make the default NOT delete anything at the
beginnings of months, for the next upgrade?

I routinely get emails containing large attachments which I don't need to
keep for long. I would still like to keep the original message, but
without the attachment. Is there any way I can delete the attachment
without getting rid of the text? Thanks for your help.

I am looking this issue currently. This is something we need but given the
weaknesses of the r* commands (as shipped by most Unix vendors), I
wondered if there is a good/best way do this?

Do I get a better rshd and use wrappers? 

The imapd machine is not directly accessible off site but I would like to
be as certain as it's possible of a users identity, without making
people `logon' with passwords flying around (Use of ssh is not possible
currently).

Has anyone tried ident with any success?

Thanks.

please consult these resources:

The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
help.  Additional information, including a User's Guide, Technical Notes, 
Questions & Answers, where to obtain the Pine software, what tools are 
available to perform tasks that Pine itself does not, and more, can be 
accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the

       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.

     - The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
       also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection
       (from Pine's MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to

the technical support staff or computer help desk of your Internet Service
Provider, school, university, employer, ... -- whichever organization
provided you with the email account on which you are using, or planning on
using, Pine.  Because system functions and configuration can vary from
site to site, they are best qualified to assist you.  (Due to the large
number of Pine installations worldwide, the University of Washington

At my uni we use pine to read e-mail from the unix server. At home I use
eudora to retrieve mail from the server. When i retrieve new e-mail that
has not been read by pine using eudora (with the leave mail on server
checked on eudora so as not to delete mail from server) then pine shows the
e-mail with a + next to it instead of an N...is there any way to change
this? What could i do to retrieve e-mail at home using eudora and still
retain the N (new) status when i read the e-mail at uni using pine? 

Your reply be e-mail would be greatly appreciated.

Sam

Hi

Can anybody tell me if there is a way to keep a record of outgoing mail,
apart from sending a copy of each message to myself.

Regards

Michael Morris

Pine keeps a copy of every message you send by default. These messages
are stored in the "sent-mail" folder. When in Pine, press the L key to go
to the folder list, then use the arrow keys to move to the "sent-mail"
folder, and press return to view that folder's index.

This was sent to me by one of our users this morning.  I cruised
comp.mail.pine and didn't see any reference to it.  Given the
nature of the 'bug', we have more than a few very concerned
users.  I've tried to recreate the problem without success, but
then again, I'm not running Pine on a Linux system... Anyone
have a clue?

Much appreciated.

OUCH! I just tried this on our system (we're running HP-UX 10.01) and it
"works" here too! I even changed a file to root ownership, read only, and it
did exactly as described above -- overwrote the file, changed the mode to
622 and the ownership to me.

Has a bug report been sent to the development team on this one?

Thanks for the warning!

Last I knew, this was standard unix proceedure. Pine just makes it a
little easier. If Pine is not running setuid root, there is no way that it
can allow a user to overwrite a file which they "should not" be able to
overwrite. Pine can only do what the user would be able to do under normal
conditions.

Since the user owns the directory enclosing the files, they can delete the
files within that dir, etc.

Just from what I've experienced- maybe I'm missing the point here?

Try just deleting the file with rm, that's all pine does (well it does an
unlink() ).

I noticed that all of my saved and sent mail have been lost as of
yesterday. But my inbox was intact. Is this a server issue or is this a
problem with pine?
Thanks,Tim

Hi,

Where can I get a list of NNTP server that Pine can work with ?

I usually get (the sever doesn't trust you etc.)

Thanks,

Yossi

Errors such as "You have No Permission to talk" mean just that. It takes a
good deal of time and money to operate an NNTP server, since new articles
alone may account for a gigabyte or more in daily traffic, to say nothing
of the number of people who read those articles, etc. 

You can find many lists of "Public NNTP Servers", and perhaps your easiest
place to start would be Yahoo, by searching for "free NNTP" or "free news
server". There is an established category for such lists.

Alternately, you could determine if your network provider offers a news
server for your use.

Delete messages from your sent-mail or saved-messages folder.

sent-mail can really pile up, especially if you have sent any large
attached files recently.

We're running Pine in a college environment and have around 3,000 users.
If any of you have experience with setting up disk quotas, what are some
reasonable limits to set?

Thanks for any advice!

Hi. I have encountered some trouble printing my e-mails from PINE. I have
a Cannon BJC-4300 and I count on PINE for printing important documents.
Any help will be greatly appreciated A.S.A.P. Thank you very much.

When using Pine's print-to-ansi feature, the weakest link is your terminal
emulation software. You must ensure that:

1. Your software supports the feature
2. Your software is configured to utilize the feature

Some software works all the time. Others work if properly configured. Some
do nothing when asked to print, some scroll the message across the screen,
some print half the message, some just give up and crash.

HyperTerm Personal Edition 3 appears to support this well. 
CRT 1.x and 2.x seem to support this as well.
BetterTelnet appears to support well, as do versions of NCSA Telnet.

The first two are for win95, the second two for MacOS.

Perhaps your best course of action would be to contact the support
personnel at your college. They would have the knowlege of the local
system which would be of great assistance is reaching a speedy resolution.

I am a student at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and this problem that
I have been having with PINE is reoccurring.  I'm not sure if it is the
school's hook up or if it is the PINE system.  But frequently when I am
using PINE, the system will bump me off, disconnect me, and sometimes the
message I am composing is saved and other times it can never be found
again.  Is there some place that I am not checking besides the "C" command
at the Main Menu to continue composed messages which is usually where the
other cut messages have been saved?  I am discouraged about using PINE if
getting cut off is a regular occurrance.  If it is a problem with the
school's system, what can be done about it?

Thank you for your assistance to a very frustrating problem.

					Aloha, Kelly

[...]

It is very unlikely that PIne is at fault where your connection woes are
concerned.

Pine saves your messages to a temporary file every few minutes. Sometimes
this file can be lost if: 1. You were not composing the message long
enough for it to be written out even once or 2. You were disconnected in
such a way that pine was forced to terminate during one of these times
where the message was being written out or... 3. you suffer a lack of
extremely good luck.

I have found Pine's past recovery of interrupted mail marginal at best...
There does seem to be an improvement with the latest versions, however.

Kelly, try contacting your school's support personnel
 regarding your disconnection problems.

This is really an issue for your local computer support personnel. It's
possible, however unlikely, that Pine was responsible for the loss, but it
is more likely a problem or change with your computer system. Your local
staff might even be able to assist you in recovering your mail from a
system tape backup.

I've downloaded 3.96 specifically for its composer checkpointing feature.

Does anyone know the "rule" for checkpointing (ie every 10 minutes, 200
keystrokes etc?) ?

I think something's wrong with my e-mail address or the connection or
something. Every time I log-in and the main menu appears, the following
message appears at the bottom of my screen in one of those long black
strips: "unable to parse internal header at 15443: from
ahatcher@longwood.lwc.edu Monday Aug 11:13:48"   The ahatcher-part is my
e-mail address. People have told me they've sent me e-mail and I haven't
gotten it. Can you help? Thank you so much.

						Sincerely,

Sounds like your inbox has become corrupted for one reason or another.
Usually, the only way to fix things properly without starting over is by
hand. If you don't feel comfortable attempting the repairs yourself,
contact your local support personnel. They may be willing/able to perform
the proceedure.

Howdy all!

Having trouble with Pine.

Background:

Win95 box, NT4.0 Box, ethernet connection.

NT4.0 box running Sendmail 1.1 and POP3

When pine is executed, it states "cannot connect with
'postman.nwmonitor.com,143' refused (error number here)"  Logged in as
'administrator' (on both boxes)  Did I get a permission wrong, or is
pine not configured correctly?  Also, not exactly sure if I have the
correct inbox: {postman.nwmonitor.com}inbox

Thanks in advance.

tod

We believe it is.

(Regarding the "last-time-pruned" date: the next year after 99 is 100. 
Pine adds 1900 to whatever value is in that field.)

MIME-Version: 1.0

Help.  I know what I did to create a problem, and I know what I've done to
try to fix it.  Unfortunately, it's not fixed.

For some unknown reason, Pine did not disappear the empty postponed-msgs
folder after the pending message was completed and sent.  I foolishly
deleted it myself from the List Folders screen.  Now Pine is totally
unresponsive when I hit ^O.  I went back into List Folders and recreated
the postponed-msgs folder.  Pine seemed to graciously re-absorb it once it
knew that the folder was empty.  Looked good at that point, but Pine still
does not recognize the ^O command (it always used to).  It DOES, however,
recognize "esc esc O".

Have you any suggestions as to how I might get back to how it should be?
Thanks,

mh

Problem overview:
When Pine attempts to read or write a mail box file in users
home directory that is mounted via NFS, it hangs indefinitely
and needs to be killed by root.

Software details:
Pine 3.96 on Solaris 2.5.1

Problem details:
Our user home directories are, for the most part, stored on a
central machine and autmounted to /home/~ as necessary.

When pine attempts to access a mailbox file in a user's HOME
directory, eg. reading ~/mail/sent-mail or writing ~/dead.letter,
it hangs indefinitely with a slow spinning baton prompt.

This ONLY happens when the user's home directory is mounted from
a separate server.  It does not happen if the user's home
directory is on the same machine the user is logged into, even
though it may be automounted to /home/~ from another location
on that machine.

Also, it NEVER happens when writing .pinerc, regardless of where
the users home directory is mounted from.

I suspect there is some problem with file locking on NFS mounted
directories.

A search of the Pine Discussion Forum Archives shows that
others have posted similar problems.  However, I haven't found
any responses that contained a solution. 

Does anyone have a solution or suggestion regarding this problem.

After working on a reply to a message in my saved-messages folder, I 
postponed it.  Today, I spent an hour editing what I had written 
yesterday and typing in more questions/comments.  The carrier suddenly 
dropped the line, and I logged back on, expecting to find a prompt asking 
if I'd like to continue my interrupted composition.  When none appeared, 
I went to my postponed-messages folder but hit "enter" one too many 
times; I had accidentally opened up my first postponed message, so I 
pressed Ctrl+C to go back to the index because pressing "I" did nothing 
but add an "i" to the "To:" field.  Now, not only is my interrupted 
message gone, but so is the message I had tried to close by pressing 
Ctrl+C!  I don't suppose there's any way on God's green earth to retrieve 
the lost files, is there?  (I dial in, from a Mac at home, to a Unix-based 
e-mail account at work.)

Thanks in advance for helping out such a hopeless cause (Computers and I 
never did mesh well!),
Kim

We have a pentium 133 computer with windows95 and use pine 3.93 for email.
We have problem and cannot print incoming messages. The print command on
the incoming message  when given, does not print the message eventhough
our printer HP Inkjet deskjet 200 is interfaced with the computer. When I
give the print command, i get the impression that it prints on the screen
but not through the printer. 

Can you please help? Many thanks.

1) You might want to consider upgrading to a newer version of pine,
   but that's not the problem.

2) Consult the user guide for instructions which telnet program to
   use. The answer seems to be Ewan telnet for Dos95.

The user guide can be obtained from:

This message is being sent to this mailing list weekly in order to
aid readers in finding information about Pine.  Before sending questions 
to the mailing list -- which is mirrored in the newsgroup comp.mail.pine --
please consult these resources:

The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
help.  Additional information, including a User's Guide, Technical Notes, 
Questions & Answers, where to obtain the Pine software, what tools are 
available to perform tasks that Pine itself does not, and more, can be 
accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.

     - The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
       also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection

If you need personal assistance with using or configuring Pine, contact
the technical support staff or computer help desk of your Internet Service
Provider, school, university, employer, ... -- whichever organization
provided you with the email account on which you are using, or planning on
using, Pine.  Because system functions and configuration can vary from
site to site, they are best qualified to assist you.  (Due to the large
number of Pine installations worldwide, the University of Washington
cannot provide individual support services to Pine users at other
organizations.)
