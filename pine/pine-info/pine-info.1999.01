   I've been investigating replacing our current sendmail here with
Postfix, the IBM supported open source MTA. (see postfix.org) It looks
pretty nice, and certainly less complex than sendmail.

   Anyone have experience (pine related or otherwise) with this thing? I
would hate to go to a lot of effort getting Postfix working, only to find
some tiny problem that makes it useless...

P.S. About editing sent-mail: "pico ~/mail/sent-mail" will do it, but
     that is probably not what you're after...

Subject: Bug dealing with enriched text? -- version 4.05
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Hello and happy New Year, everyone.  I've come across a problem in Pine 4.05,
and I've verified that it is there in 4.02 as well.  This is on Solaris 2.5.x
and greater.  (I just verified that the bug also affects SunOS 4.1.x too.)

The bug manifests when you have an Enriched text message (such as those
generated by Eudora) where lines are bolded or the font is changed.  If the
last line of the message has a bold statement on it, then that line will not
be displayed in Pine.  If there is anything after the line, including just a
blank line, then the line displays normally.  I came up with a little test to
verify this:

cat /tmp/pine.enr | /usr/lib/sendmail <username>

where the file /tmp/pine.enr is:

--------------inserted file-----------
To: <email address>
From: <email address>
Subject: Enriched test on pine
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/enriched; charset="us-ascii"

Here is a bunch of junk to take up space.

<bold>
This has been bolded.

</bold>

Here is a bunch of junk to take up space.

<bold>This has been bolded.</bold>
----------end inserted file-----------
(I've removed my email address and username where I used them for my test.
Just substitute in your username if you'd like to test this and make sure
that your sendmail lives in the same path as mine.)

When you send this mail, look at it in pine.  The second line of "This has
been bolded." won't appear, at least not on my systems.  If there is even a
blank line after the last bold statement, then things are fine.

Anyone have any ideas on how to fix this problem?  It is fortunate that not
everyone in my group reads mail with pine -- I missed a line of an email
concerned with disabling a user.  If someone else hadn't seen that line and
disabled that user, my group could have gotten into big trouble, so I find
this bug to be very troubling.

Thanks for any help.

Marty

FWIW, it also fails on PC-pine.

The developers of pine have been made aware of this problem....

FYI, disabling a user is to be frowned upon.  You are encouraged to simply
disable a user's account.  To do the former may invite a lawsuit. :-) :-0

Hi,
I would like to build pine on a PC.
I got the 4.05 source but there are no PC specific build information.
How can I get it?
I know there is a PC executable but I would like to be able to modify the
code.
Thanks Avi

Hi,
    I am having a problem with some ADDS terminals (wy60) where the
arrow keys do not allow you to manuever throughout your message to make
changes to it.    For example, if I wanted to back up over some
characters to correct a typo, the characters are erased with the arrow
keys (backspace also).  Ctrl H doesn't work.  We are running Pine 3.96
on SCO Unix.  Anybody have any ideas?  The P.C.s using terminal
emulators are not having the problem.  Terminal setups don't seem to fix
it.
Thanks

I just downloaded PC Pine and have been using it most of the day. I'm
encountering one very aggravating problem. Randomly and unexpectedly Pine
closes the inbox and has an access error. I've search the Pine site at UW
and read a couple emails from the discussion list and it looks like this
problem has to do with the mail que checking for email. 

I'm using PC Pine with pop3 email.

Any suggestions on what to do to correct this problem? I have deselected
the check mail que in the config settings and even defined the check mail
as a value much higher than the 150 default and nothing seems to work.

Thanks,
Steven Ertelt

Do you have other mail programs accessing your mailbox?  For example, I've
seen the behavior you describe when I had both pine and netscape
contending for conrol of the inbox.

I thought I remembered seeing a setting to make pine automatically save
any email that is to be deleted to a "folder"? Now that I want to
institute
it I can't find it.....I did see it didn't I? In case the users
accidentally
delete something, I'd like a backup in their folders.....I know, they
could
always delete it from that folder to, but this is to help with
accidental
deletes not intended deletes. Aside from having them save it then
delete.

Using pine 4.05

IMHO this is a classic procmail function.
I may be wrong, but I can't think of any native Pine function that would
handle such a task....if there is, someone hit me upside the head and tell
me (scream at me and generally abuse the hell outta me) what and where this
function is located and how to invoke it!
Which once again seems to point toward procmail.
I think that covers both advice and self effacing humble behavior, garnish
with a smattering of mild humor, serve hot and Voila...a mailing list
response!!!

Go to your settings and choose auto move read messages, and specify your
read messages folder, both of which are on the first screen if you have a
normal telnet sized window.

Subject: Forward causes retention of original MIME media type
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

With Pine 4.05 on Unix, I have noticed the Forward command causes
the original MIME media type to be retained.  While this works okay
if the original MIME media type was multipart/mixed, it doesn't
work okay if the original MIME media type was another multipart,
such as multipart/related (which is the most recent one that
I had a problem with).

As a workaround, I can use "H" (to display full headers) and then
use "F" and then forward-as-attachment, which gets around the problem 
but is much less intuitive (and involves more typing).

Has anyone else noticed this problem?

I thought about doing that...but I want to keep all emails in the inbox
for reference (If unable to do what I want, that was my second choice).
I saw the auto move, what I would rather have is auto copy which would 
then have a duplicate in the read messages file.

oh well....maybe a future feature - either auto copy when read or
auto copy when deleted. Either would be nice.


as a second question - what is procmail? is it a transport agent (ie
sendmail,
qmail) or something that goes between my MTA and pine?

Go to your settings and choose auto move read messages, and specify your
read messages folder, both of which are on the first screen if you have
a
normal telnet sized window.

I noticed the same problem as well when I used the Unix version of Pine
before switching to PC Pine the other day. I used the same remedy as your
described by forwarding the email, though I didn't need to use the full
headers option. Netscape email seemed to read MIME messages much better
and I used to forward it to a Netscape email accont before learning I
could just forward it to myself.

Cheers,
Steven

Oh Duh! Sorry I forgot about "auto-move read-messages"! Drat!
I guess the reason I suggested procmail is becuse it will move messages
anywhere you wish based on subject,sender, size, keywords in subject,
keywords in message body, it will bounce, forward, delete duplicate,
sort...in fact about anything you can visualize that you might *want* to do
with email, procmail will do it...and brew coffee, burn toast and so on...:)

>I thought about doing that...but I want to keep all emails in the inbox
>for reference (If unable to do what I want, that was my second choice).

Well that's where procmail shines. It will do *precisely* what you have
described to wish to be done.

Hi,
I got the 4.05 source but there are no PC specific build information.
How can I get it? Does some one has VC++ project files which I can use.
I know there is a PC executable but I would like to be able to modify the
code.
Thanks Avi

Sorry, the PC-specific source is not available at this time for a variety
of reasons including the fact that it includes some proprietary commercial
code that we licensed specifically for PC-Pine.

I agree.

Linux's console works for displaying UTF-8, so you can make full
use of 512-character fonts. Unfortunately lynx is the only program
I've found that can make use of this facility ...

It would be good if I could use PINE on the console for reading
and writing e-mail in Unicode.

Anyway, wasn't there a declaration by some standards body that any
MUA written or updated after some date should be considered deficient
if it can't handle UTF-8?

Edmund


PS. If you have a recent Linux distributation you might be able to
demonstrate Unicode by executing this in a console:

setfont LatArCyrHeb-16.psf
echo -e '\033%G'
echo -e '\321\200\321\203\321\201\321\201\320\272\320\270\320\271'
echo -e '\141\303\240\304\201\303\241\303\242\303\243\303\244\303\245'
echo -e '\143\303\247\304\215\304\207\304\211'

You may be closer than you think. Read on...

Actually, UTF-8 is a representation of a (nominally) 16-bit character set,
which can store 65535 characters, of which about 39,000 are currently defined.

Pine can store and transfer data in a variety of character sets (CHARSETs),
both one-byte (such as ISO-8859-2) and multi-byte (such as SHIFT-JIS). It
should be able to store and transfer in UTF-8. Note, though, that some mail
gateways are limited to 7 bit characters, and so there is also UTF-7.

The problem may be in displaying and inputting the data. When working on a
Linux console, for instance, you're at the mercy of your GUI environment.

If you're using a Windows PC to access Pine/Unix, you may want to look at our
Windows telnet program Anzio. It can be configured to deal with a host system
sending data in UTF-8 encoding, and display the characters directly. It can
also process characters in various other coding schemes, such as ISO-8859-2.
We are in the process of exploring the use of these features with Pine/Unix,
and would appreciate communication with anyone interested.

I've set up procmail to do some filtering and it successfully sent those
messages to the specified incoming folders under my mail directory.
So my question is how do I get it to use the incoming mail folders section
under Pine 4.02
?

Can pine pull the list of newsgroups that a server
has available? which could be viewed with an editor,
similar to how IE & Netscape allow you to search
all the newsgroups available, in case you don't know
the exact name....

I'm using 4.05 pine.

I just switched from Unix Pine to PC Pine. ow can I check for new email
other than closing and restarting the program? I've tried using TAB or N
to get to the next email but that doesn't seem to work. I'm sure this has
been asked before, but I'm new to the list -- sorry for a repeat question.

Cheers,
Steven

Hmmm, I hit A to add a group, ^T to get the list, then ^W to search.  This
isn't enough?

Anyway, the list of newsgroups is stored in .newsrc if you're using a UNIX
compatible OS.

Yes, I believe that this has been asked before.  However, this group is here
for bug fixes and administrative discussions, as the message that was sent to
you when you joined the list said.  You would do better to ask the question on
the comp.mail.pine newsgroup.

Does anyone know about the following problem I am experiencing:

I am running Pine 4.03 on SunOS 4.1.4.

When viewing an email which is longer than 1 screenful, and I
have hit the spacebar to read farther down into the email, if
I pop a window over the window running Pine, then pop the
Pine window back on top, the email is refreshed back to the
beginning. The current position being read is not held.

and that is correct. I misunderstood the search. I was
thinking the search or enter partial newsgroup name would
search the local newsgroups that have already been setup.

At least being wrong in this case was a good thing :)

Thank you...Works perfectly as I needed it.

Hmmm.... Whilst this is certainly true and a good point to make, it might
be helpful to also try and answer the question whilst stating it?

SO...

The usual way of getting {UNIX,PC-}Pine to check for new mail is to use the
^L (Control/L) command.  This clears and redraws the screen, and also
checks for new mail in passing.

TAB moves you to the next unseen message within a folder and, if you have
*multiple* incoming folders set up can check successive folders for e-mail.
(This is not the default setup: most people just have one incoming folder
-- the INBOX.)

I _think_ several (3?) "N" commands also result in a mail check, but ^L is
the usual way.

[Disclaimer: This information dates from Pine 3.95 -- we have yet to
upgrade to version 4 (updates were still coming out too fast at my
End-of-Summer-Vacation deadline!).]

Cheers,

Mike B-)

PS.  Of course not everyone has access to Usenet News, and hence may not be
able to access comp.mail.pine.  Perhaps the best solution would be to
re-gateway comp.mail.pine with Pine-Info (the latter being embedded in so
many old help and documentation files), ans set up a new newsgroup for Pine
administrators/developers called, say, Pine-Dev?

Hi!

I remember some time ago someone complained about truncated messages and
"message size mismatch" messages from Pine when using a M$ Exchange
server. I've had the same problem at the place where I work at and we've
managed to resolve it. Here's the letter from our sysop regarding the
problem (and solution :)

Cheers,
Jan

Subject: RE: PINE 

Recently I found the following concerning your problem:
Fast retrieval is now switched off.
Can you check if it works now ?

Using IMAP4 Fast Message Retrieval 
When applying Service Pack 2 to a server running Microsoft Exchange
Server 5.5, the IMAP4 Fast Message Retrieval setting on both the
upgraded server and the site is set to Off. IMAP4 Fast Message Retrieval
settings applied to users are not affected.
When you set the IMAP4 Fast Message Retrieval setting to On, the server
responds to IMAP4 queries with an approximate message size. This
increases performance because the server does not have to calculate the
exact message size. If you are using an IMAP4 client that is based on a
model that depends on the exact message size and you enable this option,
users may see truncated messages and attachments. Because some IMAP4
clients now depend on exact message size, you should enable this setting
only after you have verified that your IMAP4 clients are compatible with
the IMAP4 Fast Message Retrieval setting.
The following clients support this setting:
*	Microsoft Outlook Express
*	Microsoft Outlook
*	Netscape Messenger version 4.08 and earlier 
*	Eudora Pro V4.0
*	Esys Simeon V4.1.1
*	Cyrusoft Mulberry V1.3.0 

The following clients do not support this option:
*	Netscape Messenger V4.5
*	Any version of Pine (University of Washington) 

If the IMAP4 client you are using is not listed, you can test for IMAP4
fast message retrieval compatibility by retrieving several messages and
then checking those messages for truncation.

Subject: Pine 4.05 NNTP authentication...
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


Hi all...

I need to configure Pine 4.05 to supply a special login ID for an nntp
server.  This special login ID is not the same as my system login ID.
Although the help function talks about the "/user=" parameter, this
doesn't seem to work.  Regardless of what I place in the "/user"
parameter, Pine still uses my system login ID for NNTP authentication.

Does anyone know how to fix this problem?

Thanks...

Jamie

Hi,

The local system administrators recently installed Pine version 4.05.
Unfortunately this version has an annoying bug.  When I answer yes to the
"Reply to All" prompt, it includes me in the list of people who receive
the message.  For instance, say Joe sends mail to Sam, Tom, and me about a
project we're working on.  I have something to say in return, so I want
the message to go to Joe, Sam, and Tom, but obviously I don't need to send
the message to myself.

Is there some way this can be fixed?  I've looked through the setup info,
and the only item that seemed relevant did nothing to fix the problem.
The local system administrators are no help - they just say that it's not
a bug, which is strange, because the earlier versions of Pine worked
correctly.

Thanks in advance,
James

When doing a reply to all, Pine ignores any address in the TO: which is
identical to yours as set in the config. If its not identical, Pine
assumes that it is someone different and includes it. For instance, your
config may have user-domain = cs.unr.edu . But I suspect they may be
sending to "frye@unr.edu" .

Under MainMenu-Setup-Config, make sure your user-domain is set correctly.

Check out the help screen under "alt-addresses" in the config also.
Setting that to "frye@unr.edu, frye@cs.unr.edu" and any other alternate
addresses may also help.

Yes, this has been suggested before, and I support that idea.  But until they
do, we should still remind people to read the messages that are sent to them
when they join the group.

This also is not a question for this group.

However, I tried this and it worked.  Make sure there are no spaces in your
server name.  For example:
Server:  news.sandia.gov/nntp/user=george

But I don't have Unix any longer. I'm running PC Pine with pop3 email.

Ummm.... so?

If you notice I _did_ say "The usual way of getting {UNIX,PC-}Pine to
check..."

"{UNIX,PC-}Pine" is fairly standard shorthand which means "each of the
words inside the "{}" pair separated with commas should be expanded here
into the rest of the sentence.  Thus "{UNIX,PC-}Pine" expands to "UNIX
Pine" and "PC-Pine".

That is, the command should work for PC-Pine as well as UNIX Pine.  :-)

Cheers,

Yes, I'd like this too, but I'd rather call the techie pine
mailing list pine-tech and have it linked to a newsgroup call
comp.mail.pine.tech.

Yes and doing it nicely (as is miraculously happening now) is the
way to do IMHO!

The issue is not Unix Pine vs. PC Pine...
The key piece of information is that you are accessing a POP server, not
an IMAP server.  New mail checking is inherent in IMAP, whereas POP was
designed not for online access but for offline "periodic download and
delete" access.

Pine does not at this time support offline operation, and does not support
POP's requirement to effectively terminate the connection and re-login
each time you want to check for new mail.

New mail checking is one of many reasons to try to get your ISP to support
IMAP... IMAP use will reduce the load on their mail servers since
re-authentication is only done once per session rather than once every few
minutes for new mail checking.

I haven't tried this, but as a hack you could consider configuring PC Pine
to have a local "incoming archive folder" as its default inbox, and setup
your ISP account as an "incoming message folder"... then you could hit TAB
to visit the POP account, opening a new connection and thereby checking
for new mail.  You could further configure Pine to automatically move the
messages from that incoming folder to the archive folder (aka your ersatz
inbox) after you have read them...

One problem with this, which I have tried, is that when you are
in one of your local folders and try to send a message you get
this msg from Pine:
  
[ Send requires open remote folder. Postpone until a folder is opened. ]

So, it's best to have your inbox-path be a remote folder if you
ever plan to send messages while in a local folder. Another idea,
wich is essentially the same as Terry's, is to use

 incoming-archive-folders

to specify a folder where messages from your POP inbox are
automatically moved to. Let us know if this works!

Question/Request to Pine Developers: The reason that a remote
folder needs to be open is for construction of the
Sender/X-Sender/X-X-Sender header, right? How about if Pine
asks the user if she wants Pine to connect to a remote folder
in situations like this, e.g., prompt with something like this:

Send requires open remote folder: postpone, cancel, or open 
 remote folder

^G Get Help   ^F Open Remote Folder   ^O Postpone
^C Cancel   

Just an idea...

Thanks,
Nancy

If "pine.config.fixed" is present he may not be able
to make the change.

Hello !!!

I'm having problems with new emails getting into my mail folder in Pine
4.05. When I go into INBOX and press CTRL-L, for new message, I receive
this:

Problem detected: "Received abort signal".
Pine Exiting.

This was also happening in 4.04 (I don't know about the previous
versions). What's wrong?

								Bye.

I also got this with pine 4.05 and 4.04
it also occured when there was no messgaes in the INBOX and one arrived
with pine open.

I moved back to 4.02A and the problem doesnt occur.

im building under linux / glibc (redhat 5.1 and 5.2 I had this problem)
and i built it as: slx     Linux using -lshadow to get the crypt()
function

Regards, Jim.

Subject: Strange collection path in Pine 4.05 SunOS...
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

I just compiled 4.05 on a SunOS 4.1.3 box, and when I try to run it to
access my local folders, they have all disappeared.  The path at the top
of the screen still reflects the proper path (mail/[]), but only the INBOX
shows.  I tried creating a new folder, which worked, but it puts it in the
wrong location(I think).  It seems to create a directory with the same
name as my gecos name in the current directory(i.e. ./Phil D'Amore/), and
creates the folder in there. All of my path settings are default, except
for my inbox path, which is set to my IMAP server.

I also compiled it on AIX 4.2.0, which ran correctly with the same .pinerc
file.  I have never seen any other build of pine do this on any other
machine.

Any suggestions?

	While analyzing the source code for pine 4.03, i noticed
in imap.c, the function mm_diskerror... there is a portion of it
that does system("csh"), if the user so specifies, from a prompt.
>From what i understood, the user will be presented with this
option if a serious disk error happens... i grep'd the rest of 
the code, to see who would call mm_diskerror, but i could not
find any reference to it.  I'm a bit worried about this, so
Could anyone please indicate me who would call mm_diskerror, and what type
of disk error would have to happen, for the user to be prompted for a
shell?

Thanks,

This was an opportunity to learn something, so 
in pine4.05 I looked for files that contained "mm_diskerror"
and found the following.  Maybe you need to look
in the other directories... (you probably have by now)

Hi,

	Yes, i have.  It was a stupid overlook of mine, i did
not specifiy the "-r" option to rgrep, so i didn't descend 
recursively into the subdirs... thanks. :)

	Hi; I'm relatively new to the whole configuration
game in linux and so on. I'm trying to set up qmail to run
on my linux server, and I want to carry on using pine to
read the mail. 

	This might be more of a question about using binmail
than about pine, but can anybody tell me what my rc file
for qmail ought to be? I have been calling /bin/mail, which
ought to work, but it unnaccountably doesn't.

	Could anyone help?

	cHris

Hi,

Thought I'd ask if anyone else has had this problem.  I recently upgraded
three machines to RH 5.2/Pine 4.04.  All of them were runing RH4.2 or 5.1
with Pine 3.95/3.96 with no problems.  After the upgrades, I started
getting this problem (on all machines) at random intervals. Pine cores
with:
    "Problem detected:  "Received abort signal". 
     
Thanks,

-Joe.

Joe,
A stack trace directed to pine-bugs@cac.washington.edu would be very
helpful... as well as info on what the user was doing when the crash
occurred.

Hi, 

We've upgraded pine from 3.91 to 3.96 on HPUX.

It seems now when I look in the sent-mail folder,
instead all of the headers are the same, my email
address. It wasn't like this before.

I think before it displayed the address that I
sent the mail to.


Can anyone help?

Saw a post in cpmp.mail.pine about a similar problem.  The person believes
based on the FAQ entry at:

    http://www.washington.edu/pine/faq/custom.html#xtocid75976

that using custom headers may be interfering with the ordering in the
sent-mail folder.  Haven't seen a reply to the post yet.  If you don't get
a chance to check out thenews group, I'll let you know if I see a reply.
Sorr that I couldn't be more helpful.

Later,
Steven

I think Pine will do what you've described when your user-domain in the
Pine configuration doesn't match the domain name of your machine.  Did you
change your config file or domain name?  --Mike

I have a user who has been using PC Pine 3.96 (POP3) for several years.
Now she wants to also use Netscape Messenger (IMAP), but still be able
to
access her PC Pine folders.  Is there a way to do this?  (Without
creating
duplicate folders in Netscape and copying each individual message.)

Thanks for the info. Yes I might have changed the
domain names....


Well you see, before sendmail was configured to 
have the domain name   hostname.csun.edu. But
after that I've moved the files to another
machine, and made sendmail report only
the domain name.  so addresses now
will only have  csun.edu

Is there a fix?

Yes, the fix is to add the old forms (e.g. olm@hostname.csun.edu) to the
alt-addresses variable (in Main/Setup/Config)
