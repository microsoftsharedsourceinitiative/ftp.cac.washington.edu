Not in Pine.  You have to use another program like procmail or mailfilt.

OK folks, here it is.

o  This is a procmail file, or recipe.
o  This is how to filter mail.
o  You put this file in your home directory.
o  This is used to filter email.
o  This file is called ".procmailrc"
o  One could use this to filter email.
o  Do not use the "'s
o  Filtering email is the art of putting things in different places for
   the ease of reading them.
o  This is from one of my machines. You cannot simply cut and past
   everything from my machine to yours and expect it to work.
o  People use things JUST LIKE THIS ONE to filter email.
o  You have to do some research on YOUR system to make this work
   correctly on YOUR system.


		The dotted line is not included in the file.
			Remove the dotted line.

  Press the delete key until there are no more "-" in the line above.
		Again, remove the dotted line.


Set MAILDIR to wherever your want your mail stored.
You CAN _NOT_ use the ~username/mail syntax.  The full path MUST be
spelled out, ie, /home/kwoods/mail

Set DEFAULT to wherever the incoming mail is stored. 
most likely, /var/mail/username, or /var/spool/mail/username

The LOGFILE is a log, or record, of what procmail is doing with the mail. 
Useful for troubleshooting.  Again, spell out the full path. This file
will get VERY BIG, VERY quickly.  Remember to delete is every once in a
while. 

Now, if you've gotten this far, and you still need help, go to
http:///www.r-t-f-m.com and go fuck yourself.  
I've helped you as much as I can.

Check out procmail it rocks the house for doing any sort of preprocessing
of mail if you don't have access to your mail server.

Well, you can always block it at the MTA if you have access to it. :) But
you can still use procmail if you wish, we're certainly not going to stop
you. I've found that my spam went way down once I implemented RBL and some
other spam measures, added some additional anti-spam stuff in procmail,
and lastly, unsubscribed from linux-kernel :) My spam levels are now near
zero.

In Unix Pine if you type % to print and then decide you don't want to
print, you get this message:

 [Print cancelled]

In PC-Pine you get this message:

 [Error starting print job: User canceled]

It's not really an "error" that you decided not to print so I suggest 
changing the PC-Pine message to be the same as the Unix Pine message.

Thanks,
Nancy

The pruned-folder variable does two things:

1] Pine will offer to move the contents of the folder to a new folder
   of the same name but with the previous month's date appended. 

2] Pine will then look for any such date-appended folder names created
   for a previous month, and offer each one it finds for deletion. 

(this is excerpted from the Pine help)


It would be great if there were a way to do #1 but not do #2.

Yeah, add my vote for this feature, too.  It's especially annoying that I
have to reject the delete-old-folders thing on every copy of Pine or
PC-Pine I use.

Thanks,

Depends, procmail will let you do things at the user level so you or your
users can customize.  But also the best you can do is preprocess spam and
throw it away (a recipe moving it to /dev/null).  On the mailserver
(sendmail at least) you can have it send a response back to the user
saying 550 error and some message or some things like that.  There is just
a little more control at the mailserver level as far as spam goes.  Plus
if you filter it out at the MTA it never hits your machine wheras procmail
has to receive it first then do something with it.

In my Pine feature list, I've got these settings (along with a
lot of other settings):

 [ ]  single-column-folder-list
 [X]  vertical-folder-list
 [X]  enable-arrow-navigation
 [X]  enable-arrow-navigation-relaxed

I'm happy to be able to use the left and right arrow keys to move
around my folder list so I don't want to change these settings.
Unfortunately, I'm now so used to moving through the Pine screens
using the left and right arrows that it drives me nuts when I try to
use LEFT to move from a folder list to my collection list and it
doesn't work. To me, it is unintuitive and painful to type less-than
(<) or comma (,) to do this. My request is that some variation of the
left arrow key also work to move me from a folder list to my
collection list -- maybe SHIFT-LEFT, CTRL-LEFT, or CTRL-SHIFT-LEFT.
This would be more intuitive and  easier to type since usually my
finger is already on the LEFT key (from just having tried to use it).

Another request is that typing L on a folder list screen would move
me to my collection list screen. Right now when I type L on a folder
list screen I get this message:

  [Command "l" not defined for this screen. Use ? for help]

Since typing L on the main menu, moves me to the collection list
screen, it seems reasonable to expect it to do the same throughout
Pine.

Thanks,
Nancy

When a message arrives in either the inbox or the current folder, Pine
displays a status message that says something lie:

 [New mail! From NAME concerning SUBJECT]
 [Mail saved to folder "FOLDER-NAME" From NAME in point of SUBJECT]
                         
What I'm wondering is what is the logic behind the use of the words

 concerning
 in point of
 about
 etc.

And why do you need to distinguish between "New mail!" and "Mail
saved..." For someone who uses procmail (like me), a lot of the time
that I get the "Mail saved..." message it is in fact for *new* mail.
It seems to me that they should all use the same wording. My
suggestion is to use something like this:

 [Msg saved to FOLDER-NAME From NAME about SUBJECT]

For example:

 [Msg saved to in-pine-info From Nancy McGough about in point of, concerning, about]

Another Example:

 [Msg saved to INBOX From Spammer about Make Money]


Just some suggestions....
Nancy

I have a (hopefully) simple question regarding using pine as a client to
read mail from a unix server running imapd. I would like to somehow send
my password along with my username to imap server. I have the following
right now:

inbox-path={lanmail.iusb.edu:143/user=pmikulak}inbox

and this works fine, only prompting me for my password. I have made
various attempts to enter the password, but no success. Does anyone know
if/how I can also send the password along? Many thanks for any
suggestions.

I've just installed Pine 4.04 to use with Red Hat Linux 5.1 connecting to
a remote mail server using a modem. I have changed the From: header so
that all outgoing messages contain my remote email address rather than my
local computer name and this works fine. However, when I send a message or
postpone writing a message, the files are now saved in the <sent-mail> or
<postponed-mail> folders with my name rather than the recipient's name
(i.e. the value of the To: header) in the index. This makes reviewing old
messages very difficult indeed. Can anyone tell me how to solve this
problem?

Many thanks in advance,

David

Dear LIST:
I have a problem while trying to define a new folder in Incoming-Folders
collection using IMAP. I receive the following error message from PINE 
ver 4.10 after about 25 seconds:

[[CLOSED] IMAP connection broken (server response)]

The server is located out of our LAN and it seems a timeout occurs due to
our slowish connection line to the internet.
Any suggestions to overcome this problem?

-- THX in advance,
   M. Tajamolian

	Ah, I can see what you are saying (specifically in respect to the
bouncing an error back).  You can do that through procmail also, it's just
a little more difficult.  I just haven't seen how to setup sendmail to
block senders.  As for ``never hitting my machine'' sendmail, and procmail
are sitting on the same machine, but that's not always the case, probably
won't be the case when I expand services, whenever that is...

Here's a suggestion for a feature that I would like to have.  When I
save a message from one of my incoming folders, I would like it to
default to the corresponding Mail box.  The feature is *almost*
already available.  When leaving an incoming folder, pine prompts me
by asking if I want to save the messages from that incoming folder in
the corresponding Mail folder.  I want to extend that functionality so
that when I use the 's' command to save a message from an incoming
folder, it will default to the corresponding mail folder instead of to
the usual default (for me it's saved-messages).

Good idea?

Mike

Well using sendmail 8.9.2+ you have an access database.

Any address or partial address listed their can be relayed, denyed or
denied with a message.  Whereas with procmail you accept the message then
funnel it to /dev/null with almost the same effect just slightly
different.

It's already configurable, under the variable default-saved-msg-folder.

I don't think it is, quite, or I'm not able to figure out how to do it.  I
have the following settings:


default-saved-msg-folder = saved-messages

saved-msg-name-rule      =
            Set    Rule Values
            ---  ----------------------

            ( )  last-folder-used             
            (*)  default-folder               

Pine will default to saved-messages *always* for regular saves.  I don't
think any of the "by-" rules apply to what I want.  I want it to save
based on the folder I'm saving from (the Incoming folder).  What do I have
to do to achieve that?  I want it to save to a corresponding Mail folder
from the Incoming folder, but when I'm not in an Incoming folder I want
saves to go to saved-messages.

Please let me know if Pine can do this already.

Mike,
Perhaps the "incoming-archive-folders" feature might work for you.
It doesn't affect the default for Saves, but it specifies where any
read-but-not-deleted messages will end up when you exit the incoming
folder.

Also, I find the "by-recipient" rule to be useful, especially when the
incoming folder contains messages filtered by destination, e.g. the name
of an email list of newsgroup.

I use that feature.  Your terminology makes clear what I want pine to
do for me.  You said that the "incoming-archive-folders" feature
"doesn't affect the default for Saves."  I think it would be best if
"incoming-archive-folders" *did* affect the default for Saves.  Or, at
least, that should be an option we can choose.

Thanks very much for your reply.  I think my suggestion is probably
clear now.  Doesn't it make sense that the default for Saves should be
the same as the place where unread messages will go?

Regards,

Mike

A feature I would like is for the default for S or E to go to the
folder/directory the previous one went to.  It is not unusual for me to
have a sequence of messages I want to put in the same place.

That's how saves already work if you have saved-msg-name-rule set to
last-folder-used.

  Hi to all of you and thanks for taking a look at my problem.  I run
pine 4.10 on solaris; using IMAP.
  My problem is that during a single pine session, I have to enter my
username/password multiple times.  Every time I change folders or ask
for my folder listing from the IMAP server, pine asks me for my user
name and password all over again.  Is there any way to have pine
memorize the info  during a session (i.e. I start pine, I enter
username and password, and then am not asked for the info again until
I quit and
start pine again)?
  Also, as part of my setup I was trying to enter my correct username
to the IMAP server  (i.e. using the following syntax --
{<imap-server>:<portnumber>/user=<username>/service=<service>}).
Unfortunately my username (vnimani/mail09) contains a "/" which seems
to confuse pine.  Do you buy any chance know a workaround?
  Well, to anyone that can help me or that tried to help, my sincere
thanks.

Visar Nimani

Have you tried using the \/ key combination?  I can't test it, but I would
suspect that might work.  Alternately, you might try surrounding the
username with quotes...

  Scott, thanks for the suggestions.  I did try them but no luck.  I even
tried them in combination and they did not work.
  Do you by any chance have any suggestions related to the first part of my
initial question -- how to make pine remember the authentication information
during the current session.  See, that is my biggest problem -- having to
authenticate over and over again during a single pine session.
  Scott, once again thank you.

Visar

I've also been through this constant prompting on a Unix system and
it's very painful. Here are some possibilities for making the
situation a little better.

1] Recompile Pine so that your password is stored in the filed defined
   by PASSFILE. This is described at:

   http://www.washington.edu/pine/tech-notes.4.10/installation.html

2] Figure out how to get your user name into your server specification
   (I know you're trying to do this!) so that you at least won't be
   prompted for your user name. If you are using IMAP and the port
   number is 143, you don't need to specify those (because those
   are the default). All you need to specify is:

    {your.imap.server/user=your-user-name}

   Maybe try all kinds of quotes, e.g.:

    {your.imap.server/user="vnimani/mail09"}
    {your.imap.server/user='vnimani/mail09'}
    {your.imap.server/user=`vnimani/mail09`}

   Or double and triple slashes:

    {your.imap.server/user=vnimani//mail09}
    {your.imap.server/user=vnimani///mail09}

   Or try just vnimani as your user name. 

   Or ask your admins if they know of a solution or can give you
   a better user name.
 
3] Set up Pine so that as many files as possible are local rather than 
   on the IMAP server. This includes your address book, your postponed
   folder, your default fcc and saved folders, etc. etc.

Let us know what the solution to this is.

Good luck,
Nancy

I had that problem when I tried to use two different e-mail accounts from
the same instance of Pine.  They had different user names, so it would
never remember which user name to use.  Once I stuck a /user=leibrand on
all the appropriate servers and /user=sleib on all the others, it started
remembering everything.

Are you setting it up to use more than one account?  Or is your user name
on your e-mail account different than your logon name on the machine
you're running Pine from?  If so, you'll need to figure out how to get the
/user= tag to work...

Hope that helps,

You can try it, but I don't think this will help.  I tried using pine.pwd
in PC-Pine when using multiple user names (multiple mail servers) and it
still didn't save until I put the /user= flag in.

Hello all,

Just subscribed to the pine-info list for the first time.  I've been using
Pine for 6 years now, and was pretty familiar with it; but this was b/c
the most reason version installed on our servers was 3.95 (I understood
the behavior very well, was thoroughly versed in all the options I could
set, had procmail set up, xbuffy going, and life was good! :).

Now, 4.10 was just installed Tuesday, and a lot of things have
changed--mostly for the better.  I like the web browsing feature, and
nested folder collections have been my biggest wish (now answered).  I
think I've pretty much figured out all the behaviors that have ben
confusing me, except for one thing, which for the life of me looks like a
bug:

When I save a message in Pine 3.95, say if it starts in Folder Collection
1 (FC1), and I need to save it to FC2, I find the easiest method is to use
^T and go to folder collections screen, browse around, find the right
folder, hit enter to select it, then hit enter once more to confirm the
save, and then the message is saved to the new location.  Well, this is
how it always was in Pine, up to 3.95 AFAIK.

But now in 4.10, after using ^T, the FC being saved to doesn't change; it
only selects the name of the folder, but not the FC that that folder is
in! 

This seems intuitively wrong--unless all folders in all your FC's had
corresponding names, then why wouldn't it also pick the FC that that
folder is in?  What's more, I think this behavior is actually dangerous,
b/c if you're saving a message to your Friends FC, to the folder John,
and you're in the Enemies FC where someone is also named John, you can
save the message in the completely wrong folder and not even know it!

Now, I've checked the list message archives on the website, and I haven't
seen anything on this subject.  Maybe I'm just missing a configuration
option, but I've gone through the setup/config with a fine-toothed comb,
and read all the help pages in there (as I did long ago for 3.95), and I
could find no setting, nor even a mention of this behavior being a new
feature or anything of the sort.  So I was hoping that someone could
enlighten me as to what is going on here, and, hopefully, how to fix it
(Im really hoping that it can be fixed, as this is a truly annoying
feature; or lack of one I should say).

Well, I hope someone out there can help me figure this out.  Thank you
very much.

							BINO


P.S. One other thing I've noticed, and must be a definite bug: there's no
option to turn on the keymenu at the bottom of the screen.  Now I've
always had it off once i figured out what I was doing, but when 4.10 was
installed, I was desperately wishing for it to be back on, and there was
no setup/config for that; I had to go edit the .pinerc manually and rem
out the line on the old-growth-feature-set which was disabling it.  This
is most likely a huge drawback for any newbies; relative or complete (as I
found out).  I'm assuming that this is a bug?

Hello all, This is my first post here so please be indulgent :)

I have seen a message regarding Outlook and how it is possible to make it
export his eMails in a format readable by pine but no answer was ever
posted. ( I didnt see it in the archives anyhow. )

So I was wondering if anyone has EVER done something to actually make the
"Outlook -> PINE" mail migration work?


Thanks,

Outlook98 speakes IMAP4, Pine speakes IMAP4.

Place messages from Outlook98 folder into a folder on the server.
Retrieve messages from folder on server with pine.

Done?

	Okay, I just checked my Pine 3.96 and I see what you are talking
about, I never used this feature (or rarely), myself.  So, I don't remeber
how it worked.  I always used the arrow keys (up and down) to chose the
collection, and then simply typed (ussualy with Tab completion), the
folder name I was looking for.

	In 4.05 the behaviour is typical of all folder etc. browsing.  You
can go up and down with < and > (or is that down and up?).  So it will
present the ``default for saves'' folder, but you can back up to the
folder list using <.

	Here may be a problem related to the one that I had.  I didn't
name my folders in 3.96, as I could tell by the command line what they
were without naming them, so no big deal.  Then, when I moved to 4.05, I
found I couldn't ``change'' the folder collection the same way, so
something must be wrong there.  In truth, nothing was wrong, just that the
behaviour had changed so that unnamed folders all looked the same.  Wasn't
a big deal under 3.96, but is under 4.05

	Yes, this is a bug, someone recently asked about it, and indeed it
is a bug.  It is being fixed (will be fixed with the next release was what
we were told).

I just posted a message with a valid URL to comp.mail.pine, but when I
view the message in Pine only part of the URL is turned into a link.
Since it's a valid URL, it would be nice if it worked.

Thanks,

I've had the same problem--many times.  Shouldn't the URL always
continue until a space or newline is reached?  Brackets shouldn't mark
the end.  --Mike

Not quite... Maybe I dont understand what you are trying to tell me but,
taking a outlook folder and ftping it onto my linux machine ( I took the
file sample.mbx ) will not work as expected.

Instead, I see one big Message:

  [Part 1, Application/OCTET-STREAM (Name: "sample.mbx")  242KB]
  [Cannot display this part. Press "V" then "S" to save in a file]

Also, if the size of the file is too large, PINE dies on me like this:

  Problem detected: "Out of free storage".
  Pine Exiting.
  IOT trap/Abort (core dumped)

But in neither of thoses cases do I find the solution to my problem..
Observing further into the .mbx file I noticed that every eMail has its
"From:" -key- field crippled somehow.

The field: From: "Microsoft Outlook Express Team" <outlkxpr@microsoft.com> 
Shows as : JMF6^C

So PINE does not see it properly.

Any Ideas as what this thing is? I noticed that the line does not show as
the same thing depending if I use pico or more to view it.. (??)



Thanks,

I don't recall ever using the phrase "ftp".

That is what I would have expected.

OK.  First, let me say that I use both pine and Outlook98.

My understanding is that you want to move messages from a "local" folder on
Outlook98 to a "local" folder in pine.

So, the process is like so:

1.  In Outlook,  right click on the top level of the IMAP server.  Choose
"New Folder".  Go through the process of creating a new folder on the
server.  Call it what you will...."Transit Stop" comes to mind.

2.  In Outlook, highlight the messages you want to move to the "local"
folder in pine.  Perform the "Move to Folder" or "Copy to Folder" depending
on your desire.  Choose the destination you created in step #1.

....The messages are now on the server....then (I leave the details to you)
do the reverse operation in pine.  Move/copy them from the server to the
local folder.

No FTP, no RCP, no CP, no samba.....  OK, it is more than a single
step....but it works.

I use the expand all folders and subdirs on view option, so when I go see
my FC's they're all expanded.  Also the < and > don't work when I'm
saving, either b/c of the expanded view, or b/c it's not supported during

(Um, I don't understand how you would do this...?)

My point is just that if you use CTRL-T to point to a folder to save a
message, why doesn't it also pick the Folder Collection that that folder
is in?  Why is the FC assumed to be the same as the folder you're saving
the message from?!  That just doesn't make any sense...I'd like to hear
the reason (if there is one) for it to default to this behavior, and if
it's a mistake/bug, I'm hoping it'll be fixed.  The behavior I was used to
in Pine 3.95 made perfect sense--this doesn't.  Comments from anyone else
who can enlighten me on this?  Thanks in advance to everyone for their
help! :)

Please forgive me for making this thread so long and beign so stupid but I
seem to ( yet again ) fail to gasp a vital point here...

>"New Folder".  Go through the process of creating a new folder on the

Alright, I just created the magic "Transit" folder who now displays just
below the "drafts" and is of the same level as Inbox directly under "Local
Folders". One thing, whats with the IMAP server? AFAIK this does not uses
IMAP because my server does not runs IMAPd. I get eMail using POP3.

>2.  In Outlook, highlight the messages you want to move to the "local"

No problem here.

>No FTP, no RCP, no CP, no samba.....  OK, it is more than a single

Now this one kills me.. I am here on my Desktop PC with my "Transit"
outlook folder. How can the messages be on the mail server if I dont ftp
the folder.mbx file, samba it or something? I mean, whats the magic
something thats supposed to happen to make this folder be on my mail
server?

Thank you very much for helping me with this as I know many others will be
interested in knowing the how-to of this.

Best Thanks,
Dumb-Max

Outlook Express? Try this (giving *.mbx as arguments):

#!/usr/bin/perl

$ENV{LC_ALL} = "C";
$data = `date`;
chomp $data;

foreach (@ARGV)
{
	open IN, $_;
	open OUT, ">$ENV{HOME}/mail/$_";
	sysseek IN, 0x5C, 0;
	while (sysread IN, $dlugosc_raw, 8)
	{
		$dlugosc = unpack "I", $dlugosc_raw;
		sysread IN, $_, $dlugosc - 8;
		s/\0.*$//s;
		s/\r//g;
		print OUT "From $ENV{USER}\@localhost $data\n$_\n";
	}
}

Well...you've just pointed out the problem.  POP3 v.s. IMAP4.

I should have thought of that earlier.  But who, in their right mind, would
want to use POP3.  :-) :-)

Ed

P.S.  Glad to hear you got it working.....

  I need someone to email me about a problem.

  I have NO IDEA why, I can't TRUST my ISP, but I seemingly can't.

  I would like to know if there is a way to set my PINE account so MY ISP=

  doesn't read my DEVELOPER info, that they have NEVER seen before.  :)

  I actually am kind of doumbfounded.  I just receintly REALIZED that the=
y =

  were doing this.

  Thanks,

HI all
	Im new to this list. One of my primairy interests is to get pine
to run in color.
Im using pine 4.02 on a suse LInux system
Ive read *almost* all the FAQs and scowered pines site, also posted to my
suse list and I cant find really anyone who has done this.
I have see, read, and attempted to install the *patch*  from this page
http://www.softwolves.pp.se/pine.shtml
But with no luck-
Either the patch breaks pine or errors with "hunk failed at 636.."
"patch next file...?"
I read alot of mail per day and I *like* pine however the monotone black
and white is hard on my eyes.
HAs anyone done this and if so could give me some pointers?
Thanks
rob

Ruben, 
	The best way IMHO to do this neatly and have outlook not even know
he's being feeded with old crappy mail (heh) is to select your folder of
mail and just append it to your spool mail file, then click 'get mail'
from outlook..

$ cd
$ cd mail
$ cat my-old-mail >> /var/spool/mail/$USER

Of course, replace $USER with your username and my-old-mail with the pine
folder you wana move to outlook...

That works fine for me, but if I'm being evil please someone tell me.

Unfortunately the algorithm for delimiting a URL can't be that simple.
Some people surround URLs with angle brackets and if a URL is in a
sentence, it is sometimes followed immediately by a period or comma. 
It seems to me that the algorithm should look something like this:

URL begins at "protocol://" (where protocol is http, mailto, imap, 
 ftp, news, gopher, etc.)
Move to the right until you hit a space or end of line
Now move back from the suspected end of URL and see if there are
 any characters that URLs can't (or rarely) end with such as > . , ]
Remove any trailing character that a URL shouldn't end with

I'm sure it's a harder problem to solve than this though. Maybe some
day there will be a standard way to put URLs in messages (hah!).

Unfortunately there are still some ISPs who haven't yet jumped on the
IMAP bandwagon. Once they start losing customers though they should
jump on! I like Ed's technique for converting message folders and if
you want to use it and don't have access to an IMAP server, you can
get a free IMAP account at www.operamail.com or www.mailandnews.com 
MailandNews limits you to 10 meg of space so if your folder is bigger
than 10 meg, you'll have to split it up. I don't know if operamail has
a space limit (does anyone know?). Also, does anyone know of any other
free IMAP accounts -- I'd like to add them to my "Changing Your From
Header in Pine" page.

Thanks,
Nancy

I agree.  People should avoid doing that.  There is no way to deal
with that problem except to assume that the trailing period or comma
is not part of the URL (because it almost always was added by the
author of the message).  When a URL does end with a period, there will
be nothing we can do about it.

But we have to deal with the mailto: and news: that don't have // in
them.  It is tricky!

I see that this is a tricky problem.  They must not have written it
this way though because some URLs are chopped in half.  I hope they
are taking note of your suggestion.  If most of the URL is sent to the
browser, I can add the rest.  If it's chopped in half, I have to go
back and copy the other half and then paste it in.  So I hope they
take you up on this.

Thanks,

Mike

Some methods for keeping your files private.

o  Encrypt them with the very best algorithms available.
Gaurd the keys jelously (but *don't* forget them).  Of
course, you're limited to the tools your ISP provides.

o  Keep your files on a system that you administer and can
keep secure (a laptop in a safe, perhaps).  Lock your
backups away.  Access may be a little les conveinent this
way.

o  Hide in the crowd.  Use an ISP with *lots* of customers
and try not to draw attention to yourself.  Use a service
such as MailAndNews for persenal e-mail instead of the
systems at work.  Pick a user name that doesn't draw
attention to yourself.

o  Trust No One...

It all depends on how much effort you're willing to go to
and how much trouble you'll have to deal with if your files
are compromised.

How would encrypting files help, if the ISP gets the unencrypted files
first then forwards them to the pine reader? If the ISP has backups of
all mail incoming/outgoing, they can read it in plain english, unless
of course you are sending/receiving encrypted emails.

When I'm using PC-Pine to read a Unix mbox-style folder that I've
transferred to my PC, I periodically get notices that say:

 [New mailbox modification time but apparently no changes]

It would be great if I could tell Pine to quell these messages!

Thanks,
Nancy

According to 

 http://www.telebot.net/details.htm

they use POP. Do they also use IMAP and just aren't putting that on
their web page? 

Ob Pine comment: It's great to be able to use Pine to access free
email accounts!

Hi,
	I am trying to figure out if Pine supports taking multiple email
addresses and putting them into an addressbook distribution list,
regardless of whether the emails are found in CC or the text email (the
handy Pine select command would work great here).  If not, this is my
request that this feature be added so that users can take multiple
addresses they receive and put them in a list, instead of one address at a
time.

Thanks,

Robert

When you are on the Take Address screen, type L to go into List Mode,
X the addresses you want to put in the distribution list, type T to
take these and you're on your way.

Doh!  I remember reading about this once, but it was a while ago.  Anyone
know where the docs for it are?  I couldn't find it on the web
site...Thanks to all who replied.

I found it just looking at the online pine help; the online version
appears broken:
        http://www.washington.edu/computing/docs/pine.html
to
        http://www.washington.edu/computing/docs/paddress.html

results in (even after reload):
                                 URL Not Found

   http://www.washington.edu/computing/docs/paddress.html was not
   found or is no longer on this server.

   Please check the URL (misspellings, capitalization, etc.) and try
   again, or if you came to this page via a link, you might try using
   your browser's Reload (or Refresh) button on that page in case the
   link has changed. If you are still getting this error after a
   reload, please notify the maintainer of that page notifying them of
   the invalid link.

There was no owner set for
http://www.washington.edu/computing/docs/pine.html
so I'm sending this also to any possible webmaster and also an
address listed on that page.

A little more exploring resulted in success:
http://www.washington.edu/pine/tutorial.4/index.html#Addressbook
under "Using the addressbook".

Yes, they have an IMAP server.  I found them on a list of
free e-mail providers with Web clients.  The comments
mentioned IMAP.  I've used both Telebot and MailAndNews and
have settled on MailAndNews.  Not that Telebot was bad, I
just liked MailAndNews better.

It is nice having all my inboxes available from Pine.  Our
GroupWise server is set up for IMAP4 now.  I've had some
trouble with 3.95 and GroupWise that I've learned to work
around.  Pine 4.10 was a llittle more dificult to deal with
(but the Roles feature is great).  I read on this list that
I should recompile it with the beta IMAP libraries but I
haven't taken the time to do it yet.

Agreed.  The files must remain encrypted the entire time
they are on the ISP's system.

I expect I've overlooked a lot of other points.  I don't do
the encryption thing myself.  I don't say anything in my
e-mail that others would want to read... err.. perhaps I
should say "that I mind strangers reading".  ;-)

	Can someone confirm this for me.  I just created a ``mailbox''
which is a symbolic link to /dev/null, and it does not show up in my
folder list.  Can anyone explain why this is happening?  It's an
intresting feature, and seems to be entirely linked to the fact that the
folder points to /dev/null.  As any other combination I have tried, seems
to put the folder up.  Thanks a lot...

Our users are reporting problems with pine 3.96's interrupted
composition feature.....
We are running pine on HP UX 10.20 operating system

Sometimes the feature works, yet other times it doesn't work.

After a system hickup(reboot), our users complain that their interrupted
compositions
are not there anymore. I suspect this is because the /tmp directory got
cleaned.
Am I right?

What about during other times... Why doesn't this feature work
consistently...

Users are dialing over modem.

I noticed that with Pine 4.05 we had some similar problems with
interrupted messages here at the UW.  The machines we're running Pine on
are only rebooted when they freeze, which occurs very seldom, so I don't
know about the reboot thing you're experiencing.  What did seem to be
happening was that if a user was connected via telnet composing a message
and was disconnected (either because the modem lost its connection or if
we purposefully closed the telnet program), Pine would only write the
interrupted message file some of the time.  (The interrupted message file,
whose name I don't remember, was stored by default in the user's home
directory.)  What I noticed was that if the message was bigger than about
3-4 k (as measured by the size of the interrupted-message file), it
wouldn't save it.  If this is similar to what you're experiencing, I may
be able to find out from our Pine people what the problem was.  In any
event, upgrading to Pine 4.10 fixed it.

Hope that sheds some light on your problem...

It couldn't be that you've selected "Don't show empty folders", have you?

When invoked, while I am connected to the net, pine seems to be very slow
to be loaded. I have a vague impression that this may have something to do
with name look-up. Could some knowledgeable people tell me what exactly
can cause this slowness and how I can fix this, if ever possible ?

I usually experience this slowness, when I run pine in xterm. mails are
downloaded by fechmail. I don't read them on-line.

The version is 4.10, and the system, a linux with glibc 2.1.

I'm using Pine 4.10 under Solaris 2.6 in an xterm window with Pine
configured to allow me to use the mouse.  I just discovered two places
where it should allow me to use the mouse, but it doesn't.

One is in fcc when I go "to folders (^T)".

The other is when I save a message and go "to folders (^T)".

In both cases, a click of the select button (left button) does not
move the cursor to the appropriate folder, it is interpreted as a
'return' and the default folder is selected.  This has to be a bug.
The mouse works great in other situations.

Thanks much for pine!

A feature I could use in pine: a comma delimited list of folders in
fcc.  I often save messages by date in one folder and by topic in
several other folders.  Sometimes a message is saved in three places.
So it would be good for me if I could enter three folders in fcc.  As
it stands, it seems to allow only one folder.  Good idea, maybe?

One last idea: Allow TAB to complete folder names in fcc.

In pine we can configure so that TAB will complete a filename.  That
works great when using save or goto or when inserting a file.  It
seems not to work in fcc.  Having TAB completion in fcc is definitely
a feature I could use.

Thanks again for a great product!

And another: as nicknames can contain 8bit chars and there is an
fcc-name-rule of by-nickname, entering Fcc by hand should allow 8bit
chars as well.

	I don't think so...  It shows empty folders (cat /dev/null >
folder is shown).  That feature of course would be a bit of a benifit, but
not really....

	My feeling (and this may be confirmed by others), is that this is
related to pine being removed from your buffers, or possibly from there
being page swaping in the case of using X.  I suspect, that your problem
could be fixed by adding more RAM to your system.  At least, based on my
experience, I think that is what may help me with the slow loading of Pine
in some situations.  I COULD be way off base though.

Thank you for the pointer!  I read the article and wrote to the author
about a problem:  I couldn't find the pgp scripts that were mentioned in
the article: pgpencrypt, pgpdecode, and pgpsign.

I think this might help:

punk:~$ pgp
PGP is now invoked from different executables for different operations:

pgpe    Encrypt (including Encrypt/Sign)
pgps    Sign
pgpv    Verify/Decrypt
pgpk    Key management
pgpo    PGP 2.6.2 command-line simulator (not yet implemented)

See each application's respective man page or the general PGP
documentation
for more information.

So you might wana try pgpe and pgps :)

Cheers,
Masial

Well, it seems that the sending filter (mailpart.c, lines 4145-4255)
replaces only the first occurrence of _TMPFILE_ (a bug, IMNSHO).

The command I want to execute is:
/usr/local/bin/pgpe -tar _RECIPIENTS_ _TMPFILE_ -o _TMPFILE_

I wrote a script PGPE that has this:
pgpe $1 $2 -o $2
it seems to work.

But, I'd rather use an 'approved' method -- if it exists.

It wasn't exact when I wrote in my initial mail that I experienced the
problem mentioned usually under X. In fact, whether I invoke pine from
console or under X, there is a long delay (some ten's seconds) before it
comes up if I am connected.

As for the amount of ram, my machine has 64 megs. Although this isn't a
huge amount nowadays, may be sufficient, as I am the unique user.

What are you running and how did you get Pine?  I didn't have those files
either with RedHat 5.2, but have them with FreeBSD 3.1.

AHA!  The article is in FreeBSDzine, and could be expected to have those
files.  I am running a
home-grown-what-WAS-RH5.0-but-now-has-kernel-2.2.3-in-it version of Linux.

Can you send me the files?

I'm trying to understand the format of the .addressbook file that pine
produces.  I've written some scripts that can grab lines out of the
file for me, but they don't always work correctly.  What is being used
to delimit a record?

I wanted to be able to search for a string in the comment field and
show every matching record.  What I've done (below) usually works well
for me, but it misses some records.  It seems that the Comments are
usually on a second line beginning with three spaces, but sometimes
they are at the end of the first line of the record preceeded by two
tabs.  It seems like this is determined by the length of strings in
the name and address fields.

Any help will be appreciated!

Regards,

Mike

To grab records with some string in the comment field:

#!/usr/local/bin/tcsh -f
foreach N ( `egrep -n "$1" ~/.addressbook | egrep ':   ' | awk -F: '{print $1 - 1}'` )
tail +$N ~/.addressbook | head -2 | fmt -w 75
echo ""
end

----------------------------------------------------------------------


To grab records with some string in another (non-comment) field:

#!/usr/local/bin/tcsh -f
foreach N ( `egrep -n "$1" ~/.addressbook | egrep -v ':   ' | awk -F: '{print $1}'` )
tail +$N ~/.addressbook | head -1 | fmt -w 75
tail +$N ~/.addressbook | tail +2 | head -1 | egrep '^   ' | fmt -w 75
echo ""
end

	Is this every time you enter Pine?  Or is this only the first
time.  Sounds like an attempt to make a connection, but you have indicated
that Pine should not be doing that.  For me it may be around 10 seconds or
so when I start up when it is slow.  But, if I startup, and then quit and
return, it is almost imidiate responce...

	Now, this probably isn't the problem but some mother boards are
not capable of handeling ``large'' amounts of memory.  But, ussualy Linux
complains bitterly if this is the case.  64 Meg for Linux should be
plently unless you are running big applications or have multiple users on
at a time (as in more than about 4 before you MAY start to see some sort
of performance hit).

	This is what I have figured out

nickname^Ifullname^Iaddresses^Ifcc^Icomment

If it is longer than 1 line it seems to be split with the next line
begining with white space (spaces).  Address lists are indicated by
parenthisis.  It would be good if you could parse all fields out for your
basic parser.  That way you can maximise your capabilities....

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

In researching another problem today, my vendor found that the permissions
were wrong on my /var/mail directory. I had been allowing write
permissions for other and they removed it.

/var/mail was drwxrwxrwx
/var/mail now drwxrwxr-x

However, now when users go into Pine, they get an error message saying
that a lock cannot be established on var/mail/xxx. Operation seems to be
fine sending and receiving mail. But this error is annoying. Why does Pine
need this lock, and can it do it somewhere else other than /var/mail? My
vendor says that the permissions on /var/mail should stay as they have
left them. How do others get arround this?

Running "pine -d 9" and examining the resulting .pine-debug1 file should
yield some insight into what is taking so long.

Thanks for looking into this.  It seems to me that .addressbook is using
two kinds of field separators: a simple tab, or a
tab-newline-SPACE-SPACE-SPACE combination.  With this mixed format,
records may be on one line, or two lines or three lines depending on
several unimportant things like the number of characters in the e-mail
address.

Is there a good reason for this choice of format?  If not, I would greatly
prefer to have one line per record, tab delimited.  Then we could easily
use programs like awk to work with our .addressbook file.  It is a pretty
useful thing to be able to store lots of stuff in there and easily access
it.

On the other hand, I'm not an awk wizard and I don't know if awk can
handle the file as it is.  If anyone can figure it out, I'd love to hear
about it.

Regards,

Mike

	Your vendor is wrong.  The permisions should be:

armispian:~$ ls -ld ~mail
drwxrwxrwt   2 root     mail         1024 Apr 11 21:00 /var/spool/mail/

	I believe (I could be mistaken here), that is 1777.  I also
believe that Pine probably complains if your mail spool is 0777 as you
had it setup, but I could be mistaken.  I KNOW that I read this somewhere,
it is in the release notes, if you do a ``wheris'' for lock, it will come
up, with a fairly thorough explanation in the ``what system managers
should know about file locking''.

As far as I know a world writable mail directory isnt a problem, as long
as individual mail files arent. At worst you can get some stupid user (
then again, why would you have that ) to put some garbage in the
directory..

You would obviously get this error as pine tries to make a lock file and
cannot. You need this lock to ensure that no mailbox corruption occurs
when multiple processes try to access the file. Other dont go around it we
live with it. As far as I'm concerned I never had a problem with this
particular thing. You might also wana disable the locking (really evil) if
you think its the right thing to do...

I belive you might find the Pine FAQ interesting if you look at section
7.5 and folowing concerning lock files regarding this subject.
( I would paste you the info but at this time washinton.edu seems to be
cut off by the verio.net pseudo-network )

As I remember tho they do adress this particular issue.

This happens each time I invoke pine, but only if I am connected.
Otherwise, it starts immediately.

I get mails using pop server, but IIRC pop support isn't implemented in
pine yet.

What I can tell is that there is a clear difference in behaviour whether I
am connected or not.

I tried your suggestion and noticed this :

About to open folder "INBOX"    inbox: "INBOX"
busy_alarm(1, Opening "INBOX", (nil), 1)
q_status_message(Opening "INBOX"     )

These two lines are missing from the debug output, when pine is invoked
while I am off-line. Is this a default behaviour and can it explain the
slowness I experience ?

Maybe the problem is that Pine is trying to use rsh. Find the line
"rsh-open-timeout" in ".pinerc" and set the value to 0 (thereby disabling
the rsh mode).

The value was left blank, but with it set to 0, there subsists a
noticeable delay when I am connected. Moreover the delay seems to have 
something to do with the number of mails available in my INBOX.

Again, if invoked off-line, pine starts instantaneously.

Dear LIST:
I have a problem while trying to define a new folder in Incoming-Folders
collection using IMAP. I receive the following error message from PINE 
ver 4.10 after about 25 seconds:

[[CLOSED] IMAP connection broken (server response)]

The server is located out of our LAN and it seems a timeout occurs due to
our slowish connection line to the internet.
Any suggestions to overcome this problem?

-- THX in advance,
   M. Tajamolian

I am not sure if your error message if a local timeout or a server timeout
( or not a timeout at all for that matter ) but what I would recommend is
to see if you do have pine's assume-slow-link enabled, and if that dosent
solve it, go increase the timeouts on IMAP. If that -still- dosent fix it
then you might wana get a new line (duh) or look for an error on the IMAP
server's side. Of course you realise that this is a pine list and that if
this last senario is what affects you then you would get more luck asking
for help on a IMAP list.

IMAP list info: http://www.washington.edu/imap/c-client-list.html
IMAP newsgroup: comp.mail.imap

Best luck to you,

Try specifiying the imap port in your inbox path, ala
{mail.whereever.com:143}INBOX.

Pine will stop complaining with /var/spool/mail or /var/mail, depending on
your system, set as its supposed to if you make the pine executible SGID
with a group of "mail".  With many systems, daemon doesn't run as root and
needs for all fo the files set to group write with a group of mail, the
SGID with a group of mail for pine works with this.

I have a lot of folder collections it would be great if I could
quickly go to the top or bottom of these lists when Pine prompts me to
choose one. Right now I get a prompt like this:

 GOTO folder in <foo> :
 ^G Help              ^P Prev Collection TAB Complete
 ^C Cancel Ret Accept ^N Next Collection  ^X ListMatches
 

But it would be great to get a prompt like this: 
 
 GOTO folder in <foo> :
 ^G Help                ^P Prev Cltn  ^Y Top Cltn     TAB Complete
 ^C Cancel  Ret Accept  ^N Next Cltn  ^V Bottom Cltn  ^X ListMatches
 

I also have a lot of roles and currently get a prompt like this when
I compose a message:
 
 Compose using role "comp.mail.pine" ?
  ? Help     Y [Yes]      ^P Prev Role
 ^C Cancel   N No         ^N Next Role
 
It would be nicer to get a prompt like this:

 Compose using role "comp.mail.pine" ?
  ? Help     Y [Yes]      ^P Prev Role  ^Y Top Role
 ^C Cancel   N No         ^N Next Role  ^V Bottom Role


And actually it would be nice to have the option of choosing the top
or bottom everywhere it makes sense.

Thanks!

	This is NOT advisable.  Pine is designed as a user level program
that is not intended to be SGID or SUID to run.  To do so introduces
security problems.  This is in the release notes.  If you MUST do it, than
do it, but it is much better to follow the sugestions that are provided by
the Pine development team, and set the spool dir permisions to 1777.  This
is NOT a security risk (well, the posibility of users putting ``random
files'' into the spool dir).  Or, preferably, spooling the mail in the
user's home directory (for security reason's at least).

	I would say that my estimation is that the
newline-space-space-space is NOT part of the delimiter.  My feeling is
that the reasoning behind the insertion of it is to get Pine to get the
address book to fit into 80 columns.  So, if you wish to make it one line,
I would think that you could strip the LF-SPACE-SPACE-SPACE from the file
(at least for parsing), without any problem...

I hope you can help or send me in the correct direction
to get help.

I have been trying to information on how to run PINE
within a shell script.  I have not been able to find the
information on the WEB.

I need to send an email with a file attachment(MIMI) from a 
shell script.

What I want to do

#!/bin/sh
pine david.poland@nike.com subject /full/path/attached.file

Is this possible?  If so can you send the needed information
on how to get this to work?

I had diferent kind of problem with locks on Pine 4.10.  Due to an NFS
problem, my mbox file was 'corrupted' and pine 4.10 complained that my mail
was locked as read-only.  I could not find the lock and there was no other
pine running.  Finally, I rnamed my mbox and created an empty mbox.  That
got the lock problem solved.  I opened my original mbox with emacs and found
that I could manually retrieve the contents.  I still have not processed all
the files in the old mbox to date, but I have not seen anything resembling a
lock in the mbox contents.

Regards,

Eng Hee.

Sounds like you ran into the power outage that brought down a good part of
our network (and a few dorms) for a few hours.  Sorry about that.  :)

> Yes. This is what I am worried about. What does the t do?

This is relatively basic Unix sysadmin stuff.....

from: man 2 chmod:

     If mode S_ISVTX (the `sticky bit') is set on a directory, an
     unprivileged user may not delete or rename files of other
     users in that directory.  For more details of the properties
     of the sticky bit, see sticky(8).

from: man 8 sticky:

     A directory whose `sticky bit' is set becomes an append-only
     directory, or, more accurately, a directory in which the
     deletion of files is restricted.  A file in a sticky directory
     may only be removed or renamed by a user if the user has write
     permission for the directory and the user is the owner of the
     file, the owner of the directory, or the super-user.  This
     feature is usefully applied to directories such as /tmp which
     must be publicly writable but should deny users the license
     to arbitrarily delete or rename each others' files.

On a directory it means don't let people delete files that they don't
own. It is typically used for public directories like /tmp:

bash$ ls -ld /tmp
drwxrwxrwt  80 root     root        29696 Apr 13 09:05 /tmp

(Unix file permissions are a bit counterintuitive at times: sometimes
you can delete a file and replace it by a similar one, even when you
can't write to the file, and sometimes you can write to a file, or
truncate it to zero length, even though you can't delete it.)

I  hope you can help or send me in the correct direction
 to get help.
 
 I have been trying to information on how to run PINE
 within a shell script.  I have not been able to find the
 information on the WEB.
 
 I need to send an email with a file attachment(MIME) from a 
 shell script.
 
 What I want to do
 
 #!/bin/sh
 pine david.poland@nike.com subject /full/path/attached.file
 
 Is this possible?  If so can you send the needed information
 on how to get this to work?
 
 All help is greatly appreciated.

Not a job for Pine.  Try

	cat /full/path/file | sendmail david@nike

or look at /bin/mail.  There is an equivalent low-level mailer in Metamail
(forget the name) if you want to add an attached file.

I did expect that someone asking for help from the list would subscribe to

Well, in effect, it is part of the delimiter because it lies between
fields and is not part of the fields on either side.  It doesn't cause
the addressbook to fit into 80 columns because the comment line can be
very long.  But you must be right that it has to do with keeping lines
short.  It just seems haphazard.

Thank you for your ideas.  I hope one of the pine team will tell us
why it is designed this way.

Regards,

Mike

	It may be an outdated notion, but most lists do not allow you to
post unless you are subscribed.  Maybe the reason that the list is setup
with reply to not set is because of allowing people to post without
subscribing?

Hello,
We are preparing to upgrade from v. 3.96 to v. 4.10 on a UNIX system.  I
am trying to prepare some documentation on the new features available.  I
have read the release notes, the online help, the man pages, and have been
to the various Pine-info web sites and still have some questions.  I'd be
grateful to anyone who can clarify a few things for me:

1) As of 4.0 the release notes list "Basic rendering of message bodies in
HTML format" as an improvement.  I've tested various methods for combining
email and HTML and can't seem to get anything to work.  That is, I'm
expecting to see messages rendered in HTML, to the extent that is possible
in a text-based environment.

2) Remote address books: The help files state that a remote address book
on an IMAP server is of a different format than the usual local
.addressbook file.  Is there any way to convert one's existing
.addressbook file to the appropriate format so that it can indeed be used
from a different host? If not, I'm not sure of the utility of this feature
to seasoned Pine users with large address books, particularly if they
can't be used in conjunction with other clients, such as Outlook (which is
what I read in the release notes).

3) Global address books.  This is related to item #2.  Not sure when this
became available but again, I'm not sure of the utility of a global
address book.  If I define one, should it be on an IMAP server?  Seems
logical, yet how does it then differ from any remote address book that is
available from multiple hosts.  And if not available from multiple hosts,
what is global about it?

4)Hierarchical folders vs. folder collections.  I'm confused about the
difference between sub-folders created as a result of the ^X Create
Directory command at the "Folder name to add: " prompt in the FOLDER LIST
and those created from Setup/collectionList/Addcltn/Path:.  I realize that
the latter shows up in my COLLECTION LIST and that both show up in my
FOLDER LIST.  And for the life of me I can't save messages into either one
of them!  

If someone has documented these items on a web page somewhere, please show
me the way.  The release notes are just to cryptic and I haven't found an
FAQ current enough to address these items.

TIA,

Here's the UW's FAQ on item 2.  Please note that Dante (or Homer) is the
local machine running Pine, and deskmail is an alias to the IMAP server.

Title: How can Pine access a remote address book?

Question: I have been using Pine and have built up an address book which
is important to my correspondence.  Now I'd like to try PC-Pine, or may
need to run Pine on another computer.  Is there a way to access a single
address book when using Pine/PC-Pine on different computers? 

Answer:

Pine, beginning with version 4, can be configured to access a remote
address book over the network.  So, after some initial setup and
conversion of your address book contents, you can keep a single address
book which can be accessed by Pine on one or more Unix computers and by
PC-Pine running on one or more desktop computers. 

Below are the steps to take if you want to convert an existing Pine
address book that is on a Unix computer like Homer or Dante to make it
available remotely.  The steps also tell how to configure Pine to access
the remote address book.  You'll want to configure Pine on every system
you use the same way.  For most people, that will be only PC-Pine on one
computer and Pine on the Unix computer. 

The instructions also suggest that you change Pine's configuration to
ignore your old address book.  That is so that you will always be dealing
with a single instance of the data and won't accidently make updates to
the wrong file. 

Instructions
------------

First change the Pine configuration on the account where your address book
already exits: 

1.  Log in and run Pine
2.  In Pine choose "S"etup "A"ddressBooks at the main menu
3.  Choose "A"dd Pers Abook
4.  Fill in the form like this
        Server Name : UW_NetID.deskmail.washington.edu
        Folder Name : ADDRBOOK
        NickName    : Master Addressbook

    (where you replace "UW_NetID" with your own UW_NetID that you use to
     log in to the system.  You could also pick a different NickName 
     if you wish.)
5.  Choose "^X" eXit/Save
6.  Exit the Setup screen

That completes the configuration of Pine on your Unix account to recognize
two address books.  Now you need to copy the contents of your existing
address book to the new, remote address on the "deskmail" server.  Pine
will automatically make any needed changes to the format of the data. 

7.  Still running Pine, select "A"ddress Book at the main menu
8.  Choose ">" View your ".addressbook" Personal AddressBook
9.  Use ";" Select, then "A"ll to mark all the address book entries
10. Use "A"pply, then "S"ave
11. Choose "S"ave at the next prompt, you should see this

        Save to which addrbook : .addressbook
        ^G Help                 ^P Prev AddrBook
        ^C Cancel   Ret Accept  ^N Next AddrBook   

12.  Use ^N which will show that you are saving to "Master Addressbook"
     (or whatever you named your new address book.)
13.  Choose "Ret" Accept to copy all your address book entries to the
      new address book.

That completes the copying of your original address book to the new one
that can be accessed remotely.  Now, it would be wise to configure Pine to
forget about the old address book so you'll always be working with the new
one: 

14.  Still running Pine on your Unix account, choose "S"etup "A"ddress
     book again at the main menu
15.  Highlight the ".addressbook Personal AddressBook"
16.  Choose "D"el Abook
17.  Choose "C"onfig
18.  Choose "E"xit Setup

That completes address book conversion and the set up of Pine on the
system where your original address book existed.  The final step is to
configure Pine on any other system which you want to access this address
book. 

For most people, that means just configuring PC-Pine to access the remote
address book.  If you installed PC-Pine from the UW Internet Connectivity
Kit, part or all of that may be done, but you should check the PC-Pine
configuration: 

19.  Start PC-Pine and repeat steps 2, 3, and 4 above.

Note that there is not yet an Internet standard for address book formats
or remote access.  The methods described here will work for Pine only; not
other email client software.

Funny, last I read, you had to subscribe to the list in order to post to it.

BTW, people wanting to be removed:  Go to the page listed in the signature

Okay, this is off-topic, but I am curious.  Is there any rationale for this?
Is it a bug, or a feature that anybody can delete a file in a world-writable
directory even if one cannot read or write that file?

I'm trying to learn about MIME headers so I've got my
viewer-hdrs set to include the following:

	Content-type,
	Content-description,
	Content-transfer-encoding,
	Parts/Attachments,
	X-MimeOLE,
	X-Mailer,


I just received a message that looked like this when full headers was
OFF (I've deleted irrelevant headers):

 X-Mailer: Microsoft Outlook Express 4.72.3110.1
 Content-type: multipart/alternative;
  boundary="----=_NextPart_000_000F_01BE860C.916E3140"
 X-MimeOLE: Produced By Microsoft MimeOLE V4.72.3110.3
 Parts/Attachments:
    1   OK     ~9 lines  Text
    2 Shown   ~25 lines  Text
 ----------------------------------------
 
 
     [ Part 1, Text/PLAIN  9 lines. ]
     [ Not Shown. Use the "V" command to view or save this part. ]
 
 [...plain text msg deleted...]


And when I type V, Pine displays this:

  PINE 4.10   ATTACHMENT INDEX

   1    ~9 lines   Text/PLAIN
   2   ~25 lines   Text/HTML

And when I view attachment 2, my web browser is fired up and displays
EXACTLY the same thing that I just saw in Pine -- no formatting, no
color, no cool fonts, absolutely no reason to use a web browser. My
requests are:

REQUEST 1
========= 
If the attachment is just an alternate view, say so. I.e., instead of:

 [ Part 1, Text/PLAIN  9 lines. ]
 [ Not Shown. Use the "V" command to view or save this part. ]

Say something like:

 [ Part 1, Text/PLAIN  9 lines. ]
 [ Alternate Part 1, Text/HTML. Type V to view or save this part. ]

This way I would know that there's no need to look at this. Yes,
I could look at the "Content-type: multipart/alternative;" header
but it's a pain to ferret that out from amongst the other headers.


REQUEST 2
=========
The Parts/Attachments header says that Part 2 is "Shown" and Part 1 is
"OK" (whatever that means):

 Parts/Attachments:
    1   OK     ~9 lines  Text
    2 Shown   ~25 lines  Text
 ----------------------------------------

And the blurb at the top of the message seems to be saying that Part 1
is shown and Part 2 is not shown:
 
 
     [ Part 1, Text/PLAIN  9 lines. ]
     [ Not Shown. Use the "V" command to view or save this part. ]
 

These should be more clear about what's shown and what's not, and they
should be consistent!


Things get even more confusing when I type H to view full headers.
When I do that the body of the message looks like this:


     [ Part 1, Text/PLAIN  9 lines. ]
     [ Not Shown. Use the "V" command to view or save this part. ]
 
 <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD W3 HTML//EN">
 <HTML>
 <HEAD>
 
 <META content=text/html;charset=iso-8859-1 http-equiv=Content-Type>
 <META content='"MSHTML 4.72.3110.7"' name=GENERATOR>
 </HEAD>
 <BODY bgColor=#ffffff>
 [...deleted...]


So now it seems that Part 1 is actually HTML, but it's labeled
Text/PLAIN, and Pine knows how to render HTML that is labeled as
Text/PLAIN so that's what it's doing. I guess....

Anyway this is all very confusing. We can scream at Microsoft for
producing such bloated messages but it would be nice if Pine would
handle them gracefully.

To me it's not very intuitive how to define and change an
incoming-folder definition from within Pine. When you finally stumble
on the screen where you do this, the possible commands are:

First Key Menu
==============
 ? Help       < ClctnList   P PrevFldr    - PrevPage A Add       R Rename
 O OTHER CMDS > [View Fldr] N NextFldr  Spc NextPage D Delete    W WhereIs

Other Key Menu
==============
 ? Help       Q Quit Pine              I CurIndex   % Print      ; Select
 O OTHER CMDS M Main Menu G GotoFldr   C Compose    Z ZoomMode   : SelectCur

So you can Add, Delete, and Rename an incoming folders on this
screen but how do you *change* one? Do you have to Add a new one and
then Delete the old one?

BTW, I have lots of suggestions for improving the incoming folder UI
and functionality. When there's a chance they'll be implemented, let
me know and I'll write up my ideas.

Thanks,
Nancy

can I just say that I _HATE_ the 2 step process to edit an entry in the  
address book?

why not make it ONE step, and allow exiting w/out confirmation if there are  
no changes made?

this right-arrow-then-u stuff is nuts

There are 3 columns for an Address Book

Nickname	Name			Address
joe		"Schmo, Joe"		"Joe Schmo" <joe@schmo.com>

bill		"Wild, Bill"		bill@wild.com


NOW when you "Compose To" <joe> it will come up as "To:"

"Schmo, Joe" <joe@schmo.com>

I suggest that this is not preferable (or should be optional)

The "Address" field, if added using 'Take' shows the person's name as they  
want it to show up (how they have configured their mail).


Now the addressbook is sorted by "NAME" so I put those names as LAST, FIRST

But when I compose a message, I want it as the 'Address' shows (that is,  
after all the ADDRESS I told PINE to use!)

Now in the case of 'bill', well he doesn't have a name in his Address field,  
so adding 'Wild, Bill <bill@wild.com>' doesn't bother me in that situation.

I would like an option to change the other behavior though... I want to be  
able to have my mailbox sorted by LAST, FIRST by my messages to go out in the  
more friendly FIRST LAST (or whatever I have in the ADDRESS column... IFF  
there is only an address in the ADDRESS column and no additional info, then  
add the name

Dear LIST:
I have a problem with PINE 4.10 (and also 4.05) while treat PGP messages.
I receive the following messages sometimes during reading, saving, 
forwarding PGPed messages and exit from pine:

     Problem detected: "Received abort signal".
     Pine Exiting.
     IOT trap/Abort (core dumped)

I use PINE on LINUX 2.0.x. What is the problem source? Is it a bug in PINE
or PGP? My appreciations are for any help.

-- THX in advance,
   M. Tajamolian

It's because you have quotes around the names. If the name was just

joe           Schmo, Joe           Joe Schmo <joe@schmo.com>

then the sort would be on the letter S and the outgoing mail would look
like Joe Schmo. If you add quotes that tells pine that you really want the
comma to be a literal comma, like

              "Joe Schmo, PhD."

The next version of pine will include some color capability so you might
want to wait for that and work on modifying it instead of the current
pine.

Steve,

Do you know when the next version will arrive and what features it will
have?  I didn't see much mentioned on the Pine web pages.  The reason I
ask is that I'm wondering if PC-Pine will move to a more GUI-ized,
Eudora-like version (say, in the next two years).

I personally love PC-Pine, but some of our more influential users who
"grew" up on Eudora are causing me some grief over the less GUI features.
(i.e. navigating through the different folders/addressbooks)  I'd love to
give them more reasons to stick with Pine.  I personally think the reasons
are minor, but hey, they are the users.

Pine is a fantastic product (best of all, free ;-) )  If you'd like the
full feature list that they wish for (about 15 items), let me know and
I'll email it to you.

Robert

It'll be the next version. That is, the first version with a number
greater than 4.10. We didn't decide what number to give it yet. Also, as
usual, we don't know when, but I would guess about 2 or 3 or 4 months.

I am mostly using emacs as my editor in Pine, but I sometimes use pico for
last-minute touch-ups and, of course, in writing the message header I must
use pico-type editing commands.

I like the way pine allows me to have ^K function as in emacs (by setting
compose-cut-from-cursor).  Pine/Pico is mostly using emacs bindings (^A,
^B, ^D, ^E, ^F, ^N, ^P, ^V, ^K [when set]) but several are annoyingly
different from emacs (^Y, ^U, ^^, ^@, ^W).  I suggest that both pine and
pico allow users to select a key-binding system where

^U is turned off,
^Y does what ^U used to do,
ESC-v (or M-v or Alt-v) does what ^Y used to do,
^^ and ^@ are switched (so ^^ moves forward one word and ^@ sets the mark), 
^S does what ^W used to do, and
^W does the same thing as ^K (e.g., for 'wiping' blocked text).

It seems like this would be relatively easy to implement and it wouldn't
be 'bloating' the software.  I'm surprised that an option like this isn't
already available.  I looked around (FAQ, etc.) and it doesn't look like
it is.

Is it a good idea?

Regards, and thanks for a great product!

Mike

Would it be possible/feasible to set up some sort of a gateway between the
newsgroup comp.mail.pine and the mailing list pine-info@cac.washington.edu
so that everything sent to one would also get sent to the other?

Hi,
I am not sure if this is the right place for my questions.   
I am trying to use the c-client  code to receive and parse email messages. 
I can get messages but I am having problems with parsing them.  My main
problem is with attachments.
I would like to get one "section" at a time from a message. I was trying to
use mail_fetch_text() but I could get it to bring only all the text since I
did not know how to specify the "section" correctly.
   
I have the following questions:
1.  How do I know how many sections a message has?
2.  How do I know the sections names/value?
3.  What is the relation between sections and "body parts"?
4.  Am I using the right function?

I have read the internal.txt which comes in the imapd directory but I still
had trouble.

Any help will be appreciated.
Thanks Avi

I'm not totally clear on what you are trying to do, but

(a) The parsing of MIME attachments is specified in several RFCs - check
the RFC index.

(b) Consider writing a local mailer, e.g. in Perl or Tcl.  Your incoming
mail is seen first by the SMTP server, then by a local mailer (delivery
agent), then by Pine or another MUA.

Even it it's not to be the end product, a custom local mailer can make it
easy to test your parsing.

(c) Consider Procmail and Deliver.

These groups used to be linked but a while ago they were unlinked and
and the purpose of pine-info was changed to focus on technical issues,
which unfortunately a lot of people don't understand. What I'd like to
see is:

1] pine-info is renamed to something that makes it clear that it's for
discussion of technical issues, maybe pine-admin.

2] We create a newsgroup for discussion of the technical aspects of
pine called comp.mail.pine.admin or comp.mail.pine.tech or whatever.
Is anyone interested in posting a RFD (request for discussion) about
this? Info about creating a new newsgroup is at:
http://www.faqs.org/faqs/usenet/creating-newsgroups/part1/

3] The pine-admin and comp.mail.pine.admin (or whatever they are
called) are linked and archives are kept on an IMAP server. This is
already true of the pine-info archives, which can be accessed by
putting this setting in your pinerc folder-collections list: 

 "pine-info archives" {ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}#public/pine/pine-info/[],

4] All messages sent to comp.mail.pine are archived on an IMAP server
so we can use Pine to read and search the archives. Since the great
Mark Crispin is always talking about how cheap disk space is, this
seems like a reasonable thing for the UW to do...

Just some ideas,
Nancy

Greetings -

I would suggest a slight variation on Nancy's thoughts...

Since Pine-Info is embedded firmly in older versions of Pine (still in use
at various sites) and, presumably, is documentation around the place I
think it would be better to have:

1a]  Create a new list called Pine-Admin (or whatever), which is then used
     as outlined below.

1b]  Retain the existing Pine-Info list but give up on trying to discuss
     admin-related matters in a list with an "-Info" name!

     Instead we administrators move en masse to (the new) Pine-Admin, and
     keep Pine-Info for end-user questions (answered with politeness and
     helpfulness instead of flames! :-)  I suspect it will be easier for
     "us" to move rather than continue battling trying to refocus Pine-Info.

     We could then re-link this Pine-Info with comp.mail.pine and have it
     archived as Nancy suggests in [4] below.

I changed my default Fcc to be '^sent' and it works fine when Pine
automatically fills in the Fcc but if I fill in the Fcc by hand and
put a ^ in the name, I get this message:

  [ Can't have a '^' in folder name ]

So, there's an inconsistency here about what's an acceptable Fcc name.

Thanks,
Nancy

Is there a configuration setting that needs to be set to enable Roles?

I've set up a role with only a "To" pattern (the rest of the fields are set
to "<Empty Value>"), but it never seems to match anything.

If I set "confirm-role-even-for-default", then I'm prompted for a role, but
it's always the "Default-Role".

How do I get the Roles to be automatically selected?

I am trying to set up news on a new UNIX HP9000 running hpux 10.2 and 
use pine as my email and news reader, stand alone not connected to the 
internet.  I got pine 3.95 to work for email but cant figure out where 
the printer setup menu is that is refered to in the readme files.

Also, what is entailed to set up news both on pine and in unix, do I 
need a UUTP server on UNIX and where can I get the software?  I really 
just want to run news as a kind of Bulletin Board for my users to post 
company wide messages to.

Any help is much appreciated as I am new to Unix.

Sincerely,

Steve Conrad

 I have a TCP/IP account with my ISP. My ISP uses pine as their e-mail
software which can be accessed through shell account. I use Win 95 and
dial up connection without any proxy server.

I access my mail through Netscape Gold at my office and Netscape 4 at my
home. About ten days back my POP3 account developed problem without any
change of setting by me. I have been using this account for years but
never encountered such problem. Whenever I tried to access my mail I got
following error message;
---------------------------------------
The POP3 server responded:
Unable to process From lines (envelopes),
change recognition modes.
-.
---------------------------------------

This happened irrespective of location from where I tried to access my
mail. I loaded Eudora light in my system but to no avail and I still got
similar error message.

The problem was in retrieving incoming mail. There was no problem in
sending out mail.

If I pressed OK in the error message I got another error message saying
that my password for POP3 account was wrong.

I have checked with other users and none of them has this problem.

My ISP has a new maintenance engineer and he was not able to detect the
problem. He had opened my mail through Shell/Unix/Pine and he found that
there was one mail in my inbox and it was marked as read only. He could
not delete this mail. I also tried to access my mail through
Shell/Unix/Pine and noticed that my In-box was  read only.

I am a novice to Unix/Pine and just did not what to do. While searching
the net for an answer I came across your discussion forum and found that
similar problem has been faced by others. I tried searching for the
solution but failed.

Two days back my ISP engineer was able to set right the problem but he
is not revealing the reason.

Can any one please tell me what could have caused this problem and how
to solve this if a similar error appears in future.

Thanks

(Jamal Masood)

Sounds like you need to bug your ISP.  Threaten to move your business if
they don't tell you why your e-mail wouldn't work.  :)  I'm curious to
know the answer, too.

The only time I've seen this problem is with qpopper on the mail server.
I used to use that on our mail server, and saw this message every once in
a while.  Basically what it is trying to do is find the first message in
your mail spool file.  Mail messages typically start with a line like:

>From damorep@db.erau.edu Fri Oct 16 13:00:51 1998

(The '>' you see does not belong there in the mail spool.  Something, pine
or sendmail, puts it there to prevent a false detection of a new message
boundary).

Usually, each message is separated by a single blank line, and one of the
above lines.  When qpopper starts up, it takes what's in your mail spool
and copies it to a temporary location.  It then works with this file for
your session.  Whatever is left gets put back in your mail spool file,
before any new stuff that came in.  Also, if the session dies for some
reason, there is a possibility that that file will be left there.  The
next time you start a session, that stuff gets read first, then any new
stuff in the real mail spool.  There are two cases you will get this
message.  1) The mail spool does not begin with one of those From lines,
and 2) The temp file exists, and it does not end w/ a single blank line.

Even though they are two separate files, qpopper does not reset any
internal flags (including the flag that says if the previous line was a
new line) when it switches files.  It does, however, expect that the start
of the mail spool file will be a new message.  So, at the start of the
file, if the newline flag was not set from the temp file, the logic that
parses the first line in the file (There is a special case for this, at
least as of 2.53) pukes, since newline == 0 and IS_FROMLINE returns 1,
which is not a valid message separator.

The fix is to either fudge the header of the top message in the mail spool
if that was corrupt by putting in a From line, or go to the temp mail file
and add a newline at the end.  In my experience, the latter is the most
common.

Like I said, other programs will probably parse the mail in quite the same
way (It's how I do it when I need to parse mail files).  The error message
you report is what qpopper spits out verbatim, however.  As for the
read-only message, I am at a loss.  Perhaps the same kind of header
corruption causes this behavior in pine?

Sorry for the long explanation.  Hope it helps some.

Hello,
Perhaps this has been discussed here before but I've been on this list for
6+ months and don't recall seeing it.  We're running Pine 3.95q on Unix.

Under certain conditions, when a person *replies* to a message, the person
receiving the reply sees only any portion of the original message that was
sent back but not the reply-ers message.  Thus, it *looks* as though the
reply-er merely returned the original message without responding (a real
problem when professors are writing student and the student swears they
wrote back ;( ). The problem appears to be when the original message was
sent as HTML such that the email client generates a text and an HTML
version of the message.  Pine displays the text version, the Pine user
replies to the text version and sends everything back.  The other client
opens the HTML portion only and thus doesn't display the response, leaving
the originator of the exchange bewildered.

Do I understand this correctly?  Is there more to it?  Can anything be
done other than asking the originator to be sure to send only as text? 
We'll soon be upgrading to 4.10, which I am aware (have tested) fixes the
problem. 

TIA,

	This is a good solution, that is requesting that messages be sent
as text only.  I believe that I have only seen 1 message where HTML was
justified, and that was a seperate HTML attachment, not an HTML version of
the text message.  And this is with probably something over 100 messages
with HTML used.  In the future it may make sence, but now I'm still not
seeing any advantage to the majority of the use...
	One solution may be to look at the attachments, you may be able to
delete the HTML attachment while sending.  But, that is not much better
than the request to not send HTML in the first place, as it just moves the
problem around.  But, doing both (if it's possible to delete the
attachment), would be fairly effective in the end...

I believe you've "asked/answered" your question.

pine3.95 had a bug which causes the obseved failure.  pine4.10 fixes the
bug.

Your choices are:

1.  Live with the bug but ask originator's to assist you in avoiding the
bug.

2.  Upgrade "now" to pine4.10 and banish the bug.

#1 is a hit or miss solution.
#2 is a sure bet.

I personally don't see #1 as an option.

Ed

I have just recently installed Pine on my computer and have been trying to
configure it to operate.  I finally got everything in so that I could send a
messge and immediately got an error message that closes my program.  Now
everytime that I open Pine, I get this message and the only thing that works
is to close the program.  What have I done wrong? How can I fix what I did
wrong if I can't open the program to fix it?  Any help is greatly
appreciated.  I wanted to be able to use Pine because of the BCC address
fields.
The error message that I get is:

	Both of these messages don't come through completely.  There is an
error about:

[Error: Formatting error: Non-hexadecimal character in QP encoding]

	just after where it breaks.  This happens in both Pine3.96, and
4.05.  Anyone have any ideas?  (it breaks imidiately after an at in both
cases, one the first occurance, another there are several occurances
before).  Anyways, any help would be appreciated...

Can you try bouncing those messages to me or to the list to see if I get
the same error at the same place? I have another message that gave me the
same error, but Pine wouldn't even display part of that one.  I noticed
that the same message gave the same error whenever I tried to do anything
with it that required it to be displayed, even after I bounced it to my
other account.  Only bounce worked, because it doesn't require the message
to be displayed.

I'm going to inquire of the Pine team if they have any idea what's going

	Sure, maybe I can see if there may be something that makes sence.
I did strip the headers down to the minimum on my message, but it had no
effect as to what it would display...

	When I bounced the message back to myself through my geocities
address, (bounces back to this address), it came through reasonably well,
exect that ``=h'' became ``^?''. (quotes mine).  But, it looks like
Sendmail autoconverted the QP message, which I don't know why it did
that...  Or, more accurately, why it did it this time, but not last
time...

All I know is that both the messages you forwarded (bounced) do me gave me
the QP encoding error as well.  So I'll see if anyone here at the UW can
figure it out...

I thank those of you who responded to my last email about configuring 
a news server.  I dont have it running yet but atleast I am pointed in 
the right direction.

Todays question deals with pine and printing.  I read in the readme 
files that there is a printer setup menu somewhere.  I cant seem to 
find it, vers. 3.95.  How can I get pine to print to specific printers 
when running un UNIX HP10.2 using dumb terminals.

Any assistance is muchly appreciated.

Ok, I'm going to try again, making it clearer this time:

Why is it that when you're saving a message, and you use ^T to go to
folders, and you select a different folder collection (FC) than the one
you're currently in, this fact is not updated in the save message prompt?  
The only way to change the FC is "manually"--doing it by hand!

Is this a bug, or is there a reason for this behavior?  It is not present
in Pine 3.95 AFAIK.  It makes ABSOLUTELY _NO_ sense either--I can't fathom
why this is so...  This is the only thing bugging me in what is otherwise
a great improvement on previous versions.

I'm hoping someone on the Pine team might find a minute to respond this
time...this has really been bothering me.  Big TIA. :)

							BINO 


P.S.  I know this is supposed to be the admin list, but as someone else
pointed out "pine-info" is a pretty bad name for an admin list, and as
other people are getting help with their questions, I'm throwing mine out
there again, hoping to understand why this is so.  So, sorry for the
"off-topic" post, and thanks to all who reply. :)

	The problem clearly is that in these messages there was a html tag
added by Listserv which looked like <A href="http://www.madnation.org">,
changing it to <A href=="http://www.madnation.org">, caused the error to
dissapear, and the message to be presented correctly.  The sugestion I
have, is that it either give a detailed error report, or present the
message unrendered (preferably at the choice of the user), as the error
that is causing this is something like 10 lines from where it presents the
error.  This is a fairly rare problem, and would probably require a fair
amount of work on the QP module to clean up to provide the options I am
sugesting, but looking at it, it could possibly be done...

Subject: pgp and MIME
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Hey 
I have a problem using pgp in pine. I have tried the skripts for
sending/display-filters and everthing is fine. But there is a problem with
mails generated by elm, wihch look like the following: 

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: application/pgp; format=text; x-action=sign
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
[...]
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----
Version: 2.6.3ia
Charset: noconv

[signature]
-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----

In our /etc/mailcap we have:
application/pgp;        pgp -f < %s; \
                description="A PGP signed/crypted file"

So it works fine with elm.
But pine does not. What pine says is

    [ Part 1, Application/PGP  602bytes. ]
    [ Not Shown. Use the "V" command to view or save this part. ]

If I press "V" I get the message:
[Message X has only one part (the message body), and no attachments.]

And when the viewer is launched nothing happens.

What I want is either that pine should ignore the application/pgp entry
and use the display-filter or to use /etc/mailcap in the right way.
I have checked the mail with metamail and it worked. I think the problem
is, that pine can't handle the output, so that it seems that nothing
is happening.

Is this possible? Thanks in advance.

Stefan

i've got a sending-filter set up for pine 4.10 and pgp 5.0 and i'm trying to
use _TMPFILE_ twice in the command line. pine, however, seems to process the
tokens only once, so only the first instance of _TMPFILE_ is being replaced.
is it supposed to be this way, and is there a patch to make pine process
multiple instances in the command line? thanks.

I've got info about how to do this in 3.95 (and other versions) at:

 http://www.ii.com/internet/messaging/pine/changing_from/

Here's the outline of my page:

  * What is a From Header
  * Do Not Use a Forged or Bogus From Header
  * Good Reasons for Changing Your From Header
    * Getting an Email Address to Use in Public Forums and on Web Pages
  * Specifying Your Default From Header
    * Using the personal-name and user-domain Variables
    * Using the allow-changing-from Feature
  * Changing Your From Header On the Fly
    * Using Composer Headers
    * Using Roles
  * Changing Your From Header in Pine 3.96 and Earlier Versions
    * Unix Pine 3.96 (and Earlier)
    * PC-Pine 3.96 (and Earlier)
  * See Also

If you are using Pine 4.10, you can use a role to change your From=20
header even if the sys admin has put no-allow-changing-from in
pine.conf.fixed.
