I have been looking for a patch also, I heard that its fixed in pine 4.30
which is still in beta test, I wonder when either a patch or pine 4.30
(said to be in beta since July?) will be available.

If you are referring to OpenBSD Security group putting Pine on their
"forbidden" list, their methodology (as described) is flawed...  If I read
it right, the claim is that since pine uses c functions which can be
exploited by buffer overflows, then a hacker could construct and mail a
message which would have a super long record with executable
payload---that's a huge leap of logic there; one does not necessarily
imply the other!  That not withstanding, it could be possible.  Were that
to be exploited, the message's executed payload could end up with the
privs of the user who invoked Pine.  Seems like the safest course of
action is to forward root's mail somewhere else (doesn't everybody?) and
treat it like other layered software.

Or did I miss something else?

Let's all use Outlook Express!  (And how many days has DOD been shut down
with mail worms?)

FreeBSD, not OpenBSD (although maybe them too).

They do not imply each other, but it is cause for very high suspiscion.
Either way, it has more to do with the numerous use of these functions,
and the history of UofW systems.

There are two effects that this can bring about.  First, a DOS against the
Pine user.  Second, more serious, a remote attacker could send mail which
could get the user to execute an arbitrary command.

No, I'm referring to the remote exploit of Pine's mail checking routine that
allows a remote user to send mail to a client with a long "FROM" field,
crashing Pine and gaining access to the users account:

http://www.securityfocus.com/frames/?content=/vdb/bottom.html%3Fvid%3D1709

The scary part is "this can be used for a remote, anonymous attacker to gain
local access to the target host."

Obviously a huge concern. While no exploit has been found in the wild, I
don't want myself or my users to be the first ones to discover one.

I'm wondering if a patch is in the works and how long its expected to take
or do I have to go to the trouble to install a new local mail client
instead? My users obviously can't live without their mail for very long.

The bugtraq advisory was already posted to this list (I read it in the
archives) but here is the jist of it:

--- snip ---
A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the popular mail client Pine 4.21
(and possibly earlier versions), relating to the function which regularly
checks for incoming email. In standard e-mail message headers is a field
that holds the name and address of the sender. It typically looks like and
is presented in pine like this:

From: username <user@host>

Pine does not check the length of the username value when copying it into a
memory buffer of predefined length. As a result, if a large "from" value is
sent in the email header, it can corrupt "internal" memory when the
offending function is called and the oversized buffer is copied onto the
stack. An attacker can overwrite the return address of the function on the
stack with a value that points back into the buffer, to which the function
would return. Arbitrary machine instructions placed on the stack would then
be executed.

The real concern here is that this requires no user interaction to exploit..
a target need only be using a vulnerable version of pine. The overflow
occurs when the user recieves new email. While typically not yielding root
priviliges (unless root reads email with pine AS root) this can be used for
a remote, anonymous attacker to gain local access to the target host.

privs of the user who invoked Pine.  Seems like the safest course of
action is to forward root's mail somewhere else (doesn't everybody?) and
treat it like other layered software.

Or did I miss something else?

Let's all use Outlook Express!  (And how many days has DOD been shut down
with mail worms?)

DISCLAIMER:
Just joined, but searched the archives and did not find this
mentioned.  If it has been discussed, please point me to the
thread.  Thanx.



Can anyone confirm that in PC-Pine v4.21 (on WinNT) the fully
qualified path for attachments must be less than or equal to 79
characters?

I am not able to attach a file if the fully qualified path is 80 or
more characters.  i.e.

x:\123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012.ext
x:\directory1\directory2\directory3\directory4\directory5\directory6\file12.ext

both attach fine, but 

x:\1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123.ext
x:\directory1\directory2\directory3\directory4\directory5\directory6\file123.ext

Don't.


If others can confirm this, would the developers please extend this to
at least 255 is not longer.

Thanks.

*** Bridget Nichols (BNichols@hhnt.org) wrote in the pine-info list about
"date/time stamping in debug files" today:

:) Is there any way of having more date/time stamps in the debug files?

Start Pine with like "pine -d datestamp". See "pine -h" for more options.

Is is possible to run pine as a single command line execution as follows:

pine bnichols@hhnt.org -attach filename ....

without going into Compose and selecting ^XY

You might just want to bypass Pine altogether and do:

mail bnichols@hhnt.org < filename

...assuming, of course, you don't mind "filename" being in-body.

Yes, but you have to get Eduardo's "Pine sends e-mail from the command
line" patch first:

I have a 1minute time delay between "new mail called" and "SIGCHILD raised"=
  (under debug level 9) which I cannot account for:

11:18:15.536628                               -- gf_pipe:                  =

                      q_status_message(Sending mail DONE)          =20

Is this delay likely to be generated by sendmail or pine?

We use pine in a HP_UX machine and sometimes it takes up to 3 minutes to
start working againg when you are in inbox, reading a message or even
browsing the index. Say you start reading a message, and then you press
the down key to walk through the message but it stays like you have not
touched the keyboard; but after a few moments (sometimes 3 minutes) it
continues browsing the message.

Does anyone have a problem like this? Is it a configuration problem?
Does anybody know how to fix it?

Thank you for any suggestion.
Marcia

We had the same problem on a Digital machine, using Pine 3.95.  Rebooting
fixed it (for now).  Delays weren't as drastic (maybe a minute), but
similar behavior.  I'd like to know what causes this also.

Although someone might have some ideas as to why this is occurring,
we'll probably need some debugging info to help determine the cause of
the problem.  To help determine the cause of delays like this, run Pine in
debug level 9 by using the -d 9 flag (i.e. "pine -d 9"), and then examine
the .pine-debug1 file.

Please find attached the .pine-debug1 when the problem occured. It took almost
1:30min to get back to work. Can you tell me something? Thank you. Marcia

My directory structure is ../../tmp/pine4.21/pine...

I have an executable called pine in the pine directory under pine4.21

If I place the command line patch (outgoing.patch) in the pine4.21 director=
y it fails for all hunks.

I do not understand the first line of the patch:
diff -rc pine4.21/pico/pico.c pine4.21.outgoing/pico/pico.c

I can run the patch command from the ../tmp directory and it will locate pi=
ne4.21/pico/pico.c, but not pine4.21.outgoing/pico/pico.c

Where am I going wrong?

I accidentally stumbled on a useful feature of Pine, and have now made it
happen twice.  Problem is, I have no idea how I'm doing it, and couldn't
find anything specific in the Pine info pages on the web.  Both times that
it's happened I've been in my INBOX folder and meaning to exit to the
Main menu, I hit some combination of keys that produced a screen titled
'review recent messages'.  The screen showed a summary of how many
messages were marked deleted, new messages that had arrived, and other
useful information - a summary of activity for that particular Pine
session.  How do I reproduce this?  I'd like to use it as a tool. 

Lea

With many thanks to Mohit Agarwal, I have an answer.  What I was looking
for was the 'Journal' feature.  Pressing J while in Pine's Main menu
activates it.

Wow, I never noticed. This is cool. Note that these are in fact all the
status line messages!

I reduced the command line patch to the first hunk (removing the diff -rc l=
ine) as follows:

*** pine4.21/pico/pico.c  Thu Jun 10 15:56:16 1999=20

+     if (pm->auto_cmds){=20
+ #define CTRL_X 24=20
+     if ((pm->auto_cmds[0] =3D=3D CTRL_X) && (pm->auto_cmds[1] =3D=3D 'y')=

+       return (1);}}=20

      if(!vtinit())                     /* Init Displays.      */
           return(COMP_CANCEL);
P_CANCEL);=20

My understanding is that this should insert those lines starting with a "+"=
 into .../pine4.21.outgoing/pico/pico.c

My output reads as follows:

Hi:

I recently upgraded an RS/6000 from AIX 4.1 to 4.2.1. Since then Pine has
not been able to send e-mail. After composing a note and pressing Ctrl-X
to send it Pine kind of locks up with the message "Sending mail/" in the
bottom.

I grabbed the latest AIX binary from the Pine FTP site, and copied over a
binary that works on another system, but to no avail.

Any ideas?

Thanks.

What happens when they push X to expunge the messages manually?  If that
works, you might want to check in Main, Setup, Config to see which of the
following options are set.  (This is how mine are, for reference.)

            [ ]  expunge-only-manually
            [X]  expunge-without-confirm
            [X]  expunge-without-confirm-everywhere

Recently on BUGTRAQ someone posted a security audit on PINE
showing that it had over 4000 format string vulnerabilities.  
Being an avid PINE user, I was shocked.  I do not know the
legitimacy of this claim yet, however I wanted to ask here to get
the official response.

It was suggested on BUGTRAQ that it would be worthless to try and
fix PINE with that many bugs.  I disagree completely however as
grep/sed/perl are our friends, and this is open source.

Therefore, has the PINE team an official position on PINE format
string vulnerabilities?  Is anyone correcting any such
bugs?  Does the PINE team need help doing so?  I would be
interested in trying to help correct format string bugs if the
effort wouldn't be duplicated, and I could be assigned certain
portions of code to audit.

Thanks in advance.

Neither question has anything whatsoever to do with PINE at all.

The answer however:

man bash
man csh

Subject: pine4.21, ssl connection to imap server
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Hi all-

I have a server running imaps with Openssl 0.9.6 on
port 993, which is serving its Netscape clients
properly.  It has a self-signed certificate.

To set up Pine on my local host (Solaris 7) to run a
secure connection to this server, I have a line like
this in my .pinerc:

inbox-path={wuf.whatever.com/ssl}INBOX

This doesn't work... I just get "opening inbox" and
a spinning bar forever.  Pine was compiled with the
ssl
patch.

The last few lines of my .pine-debug after running
"pine -d9" are:

 21:39:24.347168
 About to open folder "INBOX"    inbox: "INBOX"

 21:39:24.347883
 busy_alarm(1, Opening "INBOX", 0, 1)

 21:39:24.348688
 q_status_message(Opening "INBOX"     )

 21:39:24.349268
 output_message(Opening "INBOX"     )

 21:39:24.351257
 STATUS cmd:120, max:1, min0

 21:39:24.363004
 IMAP 21:39:24 10/15 mm_log babble: Trying IP address 
  [10.3.0.20]

 21:39:25.350137
 alarm_signal()
...

The alarm signal repeats over and over... what am I
missing?  Do I something akin to a "novalidate-cert"
switch on the inbox-path line?  If I try this line:

inbox-path={wuf.whatever.com/ssl/novalidate-cert}INBOX

I get the "Can't open inbox invalid remote
specification" message.

Any help will be greatly appreciated...

Thanks Mucho,
=Barry=

The feature I'm referring to is Pine's beginning of the month, move the
sent-mail mailbox feature (I don't know the official name).

Does PC-Pine have this feature to ask the user to move/delete the old
sent-mail mailbox that Pine does?  I'm finding that users using PC-Pine
are bloating their sent-mail folder, and I'm trying to figure out a
solution.  Any ideas?

Can anyone confirm this for me?

Thanks,

Robert

it all depends how you have PC-Pine configured.  can PC-Pine see your
Remote Folders?  Does PC-Pine save sent-mail to a local Collection?

What I do is 'v'iew  the message to get to
the ATTACHMENT INDEX,
type D to delete the attachment,
then save the whole message to the
same folder (INBOX).  I get prompted
that the save won't save the attachment,
and after the new attachment-less message
appears in the folder, I expunge the
original
  
Does this help?
 (maybe there is a better way)

PC-Pine does see all the remote folders, and PC-Pine saves sent-mail only
to remote folders.  We don't want it saving to local collection because
our faculty travel w/laptops a lot, and saving to local would limit access
to sent-mail when on the road.

Does that help?

I forgot to mention in the previous mail -- I'm aware that the messages having
attachments can be _saved_ to some folder (even the same folder!).  But I
wanted to know whether there's a better way out.

That's the only way to do it within Pine.  If you want you could also try
editting the mail folder file yourself (or writing a script to do it), but
you'll want to make backups first.

The proper value for last-time-prune-questioned is 100.10 (that's 100
years and 10 months since 1900).  If the value is higher, set it to 100.10
or 100.9 (if you want to prune immediately instead of next month).

I think the next step, then, is to do the following:

 - Set last-time-prune-questioned to 100.9
 - Start Pine with the -d 9 flag (pine -d 9)
 - Once you get to the main menu, quit and examine the .pine-debug1 file.
Hopefully there'll be some information in there as to why it wasn't able
to prune your sent-mail folder.

Okay, tried that.  Here's what I think is the output in question...

13:47:02
==== expire_mail called ====

13:47:02
Current month 24009

13:47:02
---- write_pinerc ----

13:47:02
write_pinerc: pinerc_written = 971729224


This section seems to call what I think is the correct function.  I still
don't get a prompt.  I am going to try using the pruned-folders right now
to see if that helps at all.  Just a reminder, this does work in regular
4.21, just not PC-Pine 4.21.  Any other suggestions or areas in the pine
debug file?

Thanks,

Robert

I'm not sure what the 24009 means, but it could mean your system's date is
wrong.  Check to make sure it's still October 2000.

I frequently receive email that's in HTML format, but the email client
neglected to use the correct Content-Type header (text/html), instead the
Content-Type header is usually missing.

Pine sees this as plain text (as it should) and displays the entire
message including all the HTML tags.  I realize this is the correct
approach, but it isn't really the friendly approach.

I'm wondering if there's an option or configuration flag I can set to get
pine to try a little harder to interpret HTML content that isn't marked as
such?

Or, maybe there's a command I'm missing, similar to the "h" (view headers)
toggle.  That would force the page to be viewed as HTML even if the
Content-Type is missing or not "text/html"?

You could use "procmail" to preprocess messages.  You'd need a
procmail recipe that detects an all-HTML message body with no
content header, it then would add the header for you.

I have no idea an exact procmail recipe to do this, but some
piping through the unix "file" command might determine if it is
HTML or not, for messages lacking a content type header.

This would be a better question on the procmail mailing
list.  Someone would probably write it for you too.

Good luck,
TTYL

Hello Dan,

  Something you can try to see how it works for you is to use
"display-filters". You can make some educated guesses like "if the first
string of a line is <HTML>, then the message is a message in text/html
format". Of course the guess can be incorrect, but it works most of the
times. All you would need to do is add the following text to your
sending-filters configuration option:

_BEGINNING(<HTML>)_ /usr/local/bin/lynx -force_html _TMPFILE_

and after that

_BEGINNING(<html>)_ /usr/local/bin/lynx -force_html _TMPFILE_

That will take care of most of the messages.

  Now, about the disadvantages of this method.

 - The filter will be activated when you intend to reply the message, that
is to say, you'll run lynx when you want to reply to the message.

 - If a message is not in text/html format it will still be processed by
lynx if the filter is activated and the output may look ugly.

 In any case above, after quitting lynx you'll see the unprocessed
message, so you won't lose anything and may have gained something.

I have an associated question about this I've asked before but not gotten
an answer to, thought I'd try again in case someone has an answer.

Even when there is a correct "Content-Type: text/html", I find that
netscape (specifically netscape-4.6) refuses to display an HTML
attachment because the temp file which pine saves does not have a
suffix of ".html".  When pine sees the following .mailcap entry (this
on unix):

text/html; netscape %s; description="HTML"

... it saves the text/html attachment as a pseudo-random filename
(in /var/tmp, as I recall) which does not have ".html" on the end,
then hands that off to netscape.  Consequently netscape can't determine
that the file is HTML.

Anyone know a way around this?

I have no idea what the offical response is and postings to this list on
this topic are pretty much ignored. It seems like there isn't a pine
development team anymore or if there is, they don't read this list.

Furthermore, their web site has not been updated recently. So I'm wondering
if anyone is maintaining Pine anymore?

Recently on BUGTRAQ someone posted a security audit on PINE
showing that it had over 4000 format string vulnerabilities.
Being an avid PINE user, I was shocked.  I do not know the
legitimacy of this claim yet, however I wanted to ask here to get
the official response.

It was suggested on BUGTRAQ that it would be worthless to try and
fix PINE with that many bugs.  I disagree completely however as
grep/sed/perl are our friends, and this is open source.

Therefore, has the PINE team an official position on PINE format
string vulnerabilities?  Is anyone correcting any such
bugs?  Does the PINE team need help doing so?  I would be
interested in trying to help correct format string bugs if the
effort wouldn't be duplicated, and I could be assigned certain
portions of code to audit.

Thanks in advance.

I can't help you with pine and SSL, but I can give you a work around. The
most recent version of fetchmail will work perfectly with SSL. So you can
pull your mail in local and then read it with Pine.

Subject: pine4.21, ssl connection to imap server


Hi all-

I have a server running imaps with Openssl 0.9.6 on
port 993, which is serving its Netscape clients
properly.  It has a self-signed certificate.

To set up Pine on my local host (Solaris 7) to run a
secure connection to this server, I have a line like
this in my .pinerc:

inbox-path={wuf.whatever.com/ssl}INBOX

This doesn't work... I just get "opening inbox" and
a spinning bar forever.  Pine was compiled with the
ssl
patch.

The last few lines of my .pine-debug after running
"pine -d9" are:

 21:39:24.347168
 About to open folder "INBOX"    inbox: "INBOX"

 21:39:24.347883
 busy_alarm(1, Opening "INBOX", 0, 1)

 21:39:24.348688
 q_status_message(Opening "INBOX"     )

 21:39:24.349268
 output_message(Opening "INBOX"     )

 21:39:24.351257
 STATUS cmd:120, max:1, min0

 21:39:24.363004
 IMAP 21:39:24 10/15 mm_log babble: Trying IP address
  [10.3.0.20]

 21:39:25.350137
 alarm_signal()
...

The alarm signal repeats over and over... what am I
missing?  Do I something akin to a "novalidate-cert"
switch on the inbox-path line?  If I try this line:

inbox-path={wuf.whatever.com/ssl/novalidate-cert}INBOX

I get the "Can't open inbox invalid remote
specification" message.

Any help will be greatly appreciated...

Thanks Mucho,
=Barry=

from what i've observed, they try to spend their time developing rather
than discussion on lists, or updating the web pages, unless a new version
is released.  they occasionally pop up in a newsgroup or in this list if
people make enough inflammatory comments about their "lil' pride and joy"

version 4.3x or something should be on the way.  we might just have
offline use (w/out hacking a pine config file).

No disconnected support this time around.  They say the next release with
new features should have it.  Here's a pared-down excerpt of the release
notes for pre-release 4, with my comments in parentheses:

Major new additions include:

 *  Configuration flexibility
     +  pine configurations can now be stored remotely on an imap server
	for access from different locations without the need to configure
	for each location.
     +  configuration may be split into two parts: generic configuration
	and exceptional, per-platform configuration.
     +  signatures can now be stored remotely or as part of the pinerc
	file
     +  for configuration options which are lists, inheritance is
	supported
 *  New security features (SSL support, etc.)
 *  Minor rule enhancements
 *  Enhanced MAPI support for PC-Pine
 *  Various other new features and configuration options
 *  New command line options (for remote IMAP config file support)

Someone please yell at me if I'm not supposed to be telling people all
this.  :)

Hey all --

  Due to a complaint brought up by a student, we are trying to find a way to
disable the full LDAP directory view in Pine and PC-Pine.

  The reason being is that our Dean of Student's is interperting FERPA to
mean that we can not have the Student's ID number displayed anywere -- even
if it is not convertable to a ID number usable anywhere else.. (it's not a
disguised SSN).

  Before we get the lawywers involved to discussed the finer points of
FERPA, is there anyway we disable this display?  (Out of sight, out of
mind.)

Thanks,
Steve.

Hello,

I've got a new error message:

	[Mail not sent. Sending error: 501 bogus mail from]

This happened on a mail that was forwarded to my usual account from
another account, and when I replied, my other address came up in a From:
field in the top of the headers.

Any suggestions?

Clarification:  That's when we (Pine power users like myself) HOPE it will
be available.  As usual, the Pine team (which doesn't include me) makes no
promises about when new features like this one (which IS on the
future-features list) might be added.

Pine is passing on that message from your SMTP server or MTA.  It sounds
like it won't tolerate you changing your From: header.  (I presume you did
that on purpose...)  Talk to your ISP to get the details and find out what
you're allowed to do.

Well, I am a complete total die hard PINE user, so..  ;o)
I've got my complaints too, but _NOTHING_ will stop me from using
PINE short of a bullet in the head.

Cool, so the number of format string bugs will be even higher
soon!  I can't wait!  ;o)

Subject: Fix for buffer overflows in From field?
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Disposition: inline
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

I'm sorry to ask a question that has most likely already been asked
before (although I could not find anything regarding this in either
the archives or on the pine website), but does anyone know if there
is a fix in the works for the buffer overflow vulnerability in the
>From field? I've always prefered using Pine, but I learned about this
security hole when trying to install tha latest Pine port on my
FreeBSD system and finding the port marked "FORBIDDEN". After this, I
read more about it on BUGTRAQ.

I guess I have two questions:

#1: Is there a fix?

#2: Is this problem serious enough to stop using Pine? Right now,
just to be safe, I am using Mutt, although I much prefer Pine.

Thanks for any info.

Oops. Sorry. I just was looking through the archives again and I did
find a thread on the From buffer overflow problem.

We still exist and we read the list. We're not very good at coming up with
official responses. The newmail check buffer overflow bug will be fixed in
Pine 4.30. We are trying to get 4.30 out as soon as we can. We are almost
always overly optimistic when we predict release dates so we don't predict
release dates publicly anymore. But what the heck, probably next week.

There will still be 3 or 4000 possible format string vulnerabilities so we
would guess that we'll remain on the forbidden list. I suppose if we
changed calls like

   strcpy(buf, "xyz")  into
   strncpy(buf, "xyz", buflen)

they would take us off the list. Maybe we'll do that some day.

No way to disable it in pine without source code mods. It seems kind of
silly to disable it, though. It is still available over the net and will
be viewable in other applications. Seems like you need to disable it at
the ldap server.

They would likely take you off the list if you did.  The multitude of
these un-n'd str* calls appears to be the overriding, but not only, factor
in the decision.

Hmmm, I'm a bit confused, you mention display-filters at first, then
switch to sending-filters.  Was that just a typo?

I'm using PC-PINE, so I'd need to do make the display-filter command do
something different, since I don't have lynx.  Perhaps a perl script that
just looked at the message and added the correct Content-Type header?  Or
does the display-filter even get the headers?

As for sending-filter, I'm really not interested in changing the text when
I send it... at least that wasn't my original question.  All I want to be
able to do is VIEW an email that contains HTML, but does NOT use a
Content-Type of "text/html" (perhaps no Content-Type at all).

Since Pine is already capable of displaying the HTML, it would sure be
nice if there was some toggle (like the show headers toggle), that said
"View this message as if it's HTML... regardless of the Content-Type"...
maybe like "^H".

I wonder if there's any possibility something like that could be included
in the imminent 4.3x release. :-)

I sent the message over a year ago... seems like about the time 4.20 or
4.21 came out.

I've noticed something else about this... when I originally reply to the
email, it looks fine.  But if I "^O" to postpone it, then continue it
later, that's when it gets screwed up.

I'm wondering if there are any patches for this, or if perhaps it will be
fixed in 4.3x?

Any chance these "Minor rule enhancements" would include some Role
handling... specifically, supporting ^P and ^N to select a Role?

I believe I wasn't the only one that wanted that particular feature added
back in. ;-)

Yes. It should be display filters all the way through.

You may not be able to use filters, because the Pipe command does not
work correctly on PC-Pine. I could be wrong on this point though.

I do not see the bug you mention in the pre-release of pine4.30 which is
coming soon, so it must have been fixed.

Is there anyway to use a different sort order in my INBOX (or INBOX) and
folders?

I like to have my INBOX sorted by "arrival", so I can look at the bottom
to see what the latest mail is.

Often times I let email (that I'm supposed to do something with) sit in my
inbox for a while, before I save it to a folder.  But when I go look in
the folder, it appears the "arrival" date is the date it was saved in the
folder, not the date it originally received in the INBOX.

So, I end up sorting a folder by Date every time I go into it.

It would be nice to have a default sort-order for folders (not including
INBOX) that was by "Date", instead of "Arrival".

Anyway to do that?

Along these lines, using PC-Pine 4.20, I find that when I sort non-INBOX
folders by 'Date' ($,D), I get an index sorted by true date sent, but when
I sort by 'Arrival' ($,A), it seems to ignore year so that, for instance,
April 1999 and April 2000 messages are sorted one after another, followed
by May 1999. What was the intended difference between sorting by 'Date'
versus 'Arrival'? What is the purpose of 'Arrival' ignoring year or is
this a bug?

Arrival is the order in which messages exist in your Inbox as-is; this box
is simply appended to when new messages arrive.  When sorting by arrival,
Pine likely does not look at any headers whatesover, including the Date.

Sorting by date is sorting by the time which a message was sent.

Both of these bits of information can be found by looking into the help of
the sort-key option in the Configuration.

According to the help of the "sort-key" option in the Configuration (Main
Menu->Setup->Configuaration), arrival is the default, but it might have
been overriden by a global configuaration for your system, so you can just
re-set your sorting desire in the "sort-key" option.

 You can use a patch that I wrote which allows you to do this, (pick the
patch from the address in my signature). It is called "define your own
rules... etc", and in particular you can define specific sort orders for
specific folders, so for example you can have any newsgroup sorted by
OrderedSubject, Inbox, sorted by arrival and saved-messages sorted by
date.

  Once you apply the patch you have to add to your "new-rules"
configuration variables some rules that specify which action is to be
taken. You can add as many rules as you like, only the first one which is
satisfied at any time will be executed.

  For example, this one sorts every folder that is not INBOX by Date.
INBOX will be sorted in the way you specify your default sort, which
is usually by Arrival

_FOLDER_ != {INBOX} => _SORT_{Date}

or this sorts every newsgroup by OrderedSubject

_FOLDER_ == {_NEWS_} => _SORT_{OrderedSubj}

or this sorts saved-messages by From

_FOLDER_ == {saved-messages} => _SORT_{From}

etc, there are much more things you can do with it. I have much more
examples in my web page.

Dear Pine developers:

Since I am seeing talk about a pending release of Pine 4.30 and
have not heard anything about my post of Oct 4th
<http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/2000.10/msg00078.html>, I
was wondering if this bug (IMO) has been noted and corrected.

Thanks.

Hi Derek,

We are aware of this problem, and it is on the list of things to consider
for a future release.  In 4.30, you will be able to use the "^To Files"
dialog to attach files whose name contain more than 80 characters (which
you couldn't do in 4.21), but you still will not be able to type in
attachments longer than that.  I think that the dialog will be sufficient
for most cases (and hopefully yours), but those who will wish to manually
type in file paths of longer than 80 characters will still be stuck.

First, thanks for the reply.


Let me see if I understand your post.

In v4.30+ user should be able to attach files using the "^To
Files" dialog with a path (and filename/extension) over 80 characters,
but you will not be able to type straight into the attchmnt line the
the same file (path/filename/extension over 80 characters).

(I attach through the "^To Files" dialog anyways. :)

Exactly.  You understood me correctly. The 80 character thing is a
limitation of pico, which currently has no way of handling the typing of
characters longer than the screen's width for something like attachments.

> (I attach through the "^To Files" dialog anyways. :)

I thought so. :)

This sounds very cool.  Unfortunately, I'm once again hampered by the fact
that I'm using PC-PINE and don't have the source.

Why is it the source for PC-PINE isn't available?

Pine is currently on the forbidden list in the FreeBSD ports
collection because of a buffer overflow bug in the From field. In a
nutshell, a very long from header will overflow a buffer in Pine,
causing it to crash. The problem with this is that a when the buffer
overflows, it can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on
your system. All he has to do is send a malicious email message that
overflows Pine's buffer.

This is, unfortunatly, only one of many thousands of potential
vulnerabilites in Pine, so I doubt that fixing this one problem will
get it off the forbidden list.

I would like to see Pine fixed since I really like Pine. However,
right now, I am using Mutt just to be safe.

A potential way around this problem pending fixing of Pine is to have
an MDA such as procmail filter messages with malicious headers
prior to delivery.

I'm running Pine on RHLinux 6.2, and one of the things I'd like to access is
the mail on my local MS Exchange (5.5) server.  I've conferred Pine to
include the server via IMAP.  I can see all of the folders for my Exchange
account, and I can seem mail in subfolders, but I can't see any mail in the
primary "Inbox" folder.  Most, but not all of my folders are sub-folders of
the Inbox.

Do you have a good procmail rule to kill mails with too long (for
Pine) header lines?

Unfortunately, I don't. But I can point you to a web resource that I
think will probably be very helpful. I haven't actually read most of
this web site, but it does look like it addresses the issue.

http://www.impsec.org/email-tools/procmail-security.html

Hope that URL helps you out some.

Oh. Something else I should mention just to make sure there is no
misunderstanding.

These bugs are not limitted to FreeBSD. They affect Pine running on
all platforms. FreeBSD just does a reasonably good job of warning
their users about bugs in applications and not just the OS itself.

I have an HTML SPAM message which some arsehole sent me that
causes PINE 4.21 to crash if I try to forward it.  Who do I send
this bug report to, and will a bug fix be made if I do?

The message is multipart MIME.

So, if anybody wants to have free hardware sent to them, don't call me, but 
instead write your own operating system.  It has worked every time for me.

            I've been trying to install PINE on Macintosh OS X (Public =
Beta) from the command prompt without success. Does anybody on the list =
have experience in compiling PINE on Darwin? I could not find an =
appropriate port for OS X so I've used "nxt", "mct" while using the =
"./build" command and here's what I got in the end:=20
=20
Links to executables are in bin directory:
__TEXT  __DATA  __OBJC  others  dec     hex
size: can't open file: bin/pine (No such file or directory)

size: can't open file: bin/pico (No such file or directory)
size: can't open file: bin/pilot (No such file or directory)
Done

The other ports I tried were: aux, bsd, bsf, gen, and mac. When I used =
these, I got this message at the end of the compilation:

Any help to find the appropriate port and/or tips will be appreciated.

You need to find or make an OS X port.  I'd wait for 4.30, which should be
out shortly (within a couple weeks).  Here's what Jeff Franklin of the
Pine team said in comp.mail.pine.  For the complete thread, see

Matt, this might not make it to the pine-info@u.washington.edu since I'm not on the list (ie. might get rejected) ... forward it for me if you don't see it or you know that non-members aren't allowed to post it to the list.

I actually figured out how to get it to build all at once.  :)

I remember getting stuff like that ... it was a bummer

I also tried bsd and bsf ... bsf nearly did the trick (see below)

This is the story of how I got pine 4.21 to compile.  It is initially ugly and but does result in a nice packaged solution if someone who can make these changes will do them to the next release of pine.

log-based directions (see below before you do this):
0) cd pine; cp makefile.bsf makefile.dar;
1) cd ../pico; cp makefile.bsf makefile.dar
2) comment out -ltermcap from line 47 of makefile.dar
3) cd ../pine; comment out -ltermlib from line 64 of makefile.dar
4) cd ..; build dar [get pico and pilot]
5) delete only line "-lcrypt" in c-client/LDFLAGS
6) build dar [get pine]
7) cd imapd; make
8) cd ..; build dar [get imapd]
9) cd imap; make
10) cd ..; build dar [get mtest]

[these do work ...]
yuck ... hey, wait a second

real directions:
1) cd pine; cp makefile.bsf makefile.dar;
2) cd ../pico; cp makefile.bsf makefile.dar
3) delete -ltermcap from line 47 of makefile.dar
4) cd ../pine; delete -ltermlib from line 64 of makefile.dar
5) cd ../imap; add "dar" to target line containing bsf in Makefile
6) cd src/osdep/unix; around line 192 of Makefile, create a new section
   called "dar" that is the same as bsf and looks a bit like this (remember
   I have pine 4.21: change name and drop the -lcrypt and preceeding \):

dar:    # Darwin (aka Mac OS X)
        $(BUILD) `cat EXTRASPECIALS` OS=bsi SIGTYPE=psx \
         SPOOLDIR=/var \
         ACTIVEFILE=/usr/local/news/lib/active \
         RSHPATH=/usr/bin/rsh \
         BASECFLAGS="-g -O -pipe -DNFSKLUDGE"
7) cd ../../../..; build dar

I get (woohoo after much labor!):
Links to executables are in bin directory:
__TEXT  __DATA  __OBJC  others  dec     hex
3194880 233472  0       712704  4141056 3f3000  bin/pine
589824  12288   0       634880  1236992 12e000  bin/mtest
634880  20480   0       688128  1343488 148000  bin/imapd
270336  12288   0       24576   307200  4b000   bin/pico
266240  12288   0       24576   303104  4a000   bin/pilot
Done

Let me know if you have any trouble,
Soren

P.S. gotta wonder what the "*** TEMPORARY for PINE 4.10 BUILD" messages were doing in my pine 4.21 distribution.

Dear list members,
I have the following problem, and wonder if there is an easy and safe way
to tackle it.  I have, it seems for long, during conversions and additions
to my address book, started taking certain address as "distribution list",
instead of a single entry.  If I try to delete that list, even at the risk
of losing these addresses, then the remaining addresses, correctly stored,
appear in reverse order, so, I really do not know where to stop.  I would
like to have all those addresses labelled as distribution lists, shown
correctly as single addresses in my address book.  If there is a not too
complicated way of doing this, I would be most grateful to hear from
you.  I have pine v4.20 and 4.21 in my two accounts, which I interact,
hence the problem may have arrisen.
				With Kindest Regards,
				Panagiotis

So use a different spell checker, or offer a source version without it.  Or is
it too much integrated into the program?

Subject: Updating 'new message' count dynamically
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

I've mentioned this before in passing in discussions of other problems/
suggestions, but here it is again on its own as an enhancement request..
(Well, I actually consider it a bug, but maybe others don't.)

The problem:
pine doesn't update its list of 'new' messages upon expunging or change of
status from another email program.  And yes, I do frequently use two email
programs (IMAP of course) on the same mailbox.  

The fix:
1) The "most noticable" fix, I would say, would be to
count_new_messages()  [I sure HOPE there's something at that granularity]
after pine has noticed that messages have been expunged..
(it prints the message at the bottom -- it must know somehow!)

2) also count_new_messages() when it notices status of messages
have changed (i.e. some went from new to non-new).

Hopefully someone can whip this out.

I'll answer that, since I've spent the past 72 hours trying to compile =
Pine on Darwin without any success and finally got it installed from the =
MacAddict site.=20

Mark, what you've downloaded from MacAddict's website is a binary. So =
you don't have to worry about compiling it again! You're probably =
getting those errors because you've used the "osx" port. There is no =
such port (as yet) in Pine. The files on MacAddict's website have been =
modified to make it compatible with Darwin. Try ./build bsd and it =
should compile fine...(NOTE: If you download pine.tar.gz from U =
Washington's website and compile it for bsd, you will have problems. The =
files on MacAddict's website have been modified for Darwin)...although =
you don't have to since it's already been done for you...but if you're =
just curious like me, go right ahead.=20

Even though I've got that out of the way, I'm still having problems =
configuring Pine to use "sendmail". So if you or anybody on the list =
could help me out with that, I'd be greatful. I have OS X installed on =
an iMac that's configured to obtain an IP address from a DHCP server.=20

I have the following value set in "smtp-server" in Pine's configuration:
/usr/sbin/sendmail                                        (that's where =
sendmail is)

and this value set in "user-domain":
mac-test-machine.uta.edu                 ("mac-test-machine" is the name =
of the computer)

When I try to send a message, I get this error: [Error sending: Invalid =
host specifier: /usr/sbin/sendmail]

Any of you out there know what the problem could be?

  My new ISP requires Authentification function to get into the SMTP
server. This function exists on OE and Netscape Messenger.

Does PC Pine 4.21 for win 95 have this capability ?

If so, how do I activate it ?

Thanks in advance

Hi!

 I have problem with pine, because they have srange behaviour there. Normally
 they should skip between new arrived mails if TAB key is pressed and if they
 reach last message - they should skip to anoter pine catalogue where is next
 new message. This work on linux machine without any special configuration,
 just after standard instalation, but this freature don't work on Sun
 machines and I don't know what is wrong, because I try this with any
 configuration (also with default generated .pinerc file) and pine still do
 this same - if reach last mail in pine directory they won't go to another.

   This behaviour is very tired for me, because I have quite a few directores
 where I filter my message according to message type (topic, subject, from,
 ... etc) and is very hard to find where is stored new arrived message (I
 must get in in each pine directory if I want find new message).
 
 Anybody help me resolve this problem? Please!
 
Regards

Piotr

smtp-server is the server pine connects to to send mail...
For me that is blank since I use sendmail directly but if one don't have
sendmail (or compatible) then that option comes in handy.

user-domain sets the FROM domainpart... normally pine get it from the
hostname but it could be wrong and then that option is the one to use.

For me I set it to: mds.mdh.se
as that is my maildomain...

>When I try to send a message, I get this error: [Error sending: Invalid

Ofcourse... pine tried to resolv /usr/sbin/sendmail as a host...

You will have to leave smtp-server blank and set sendmail-path instead.

As in sendmail-path: /usr/sbin/sendmail

I think so. Try setting the /user=3D flag on your smtp server definition
in (M)ain (S)etup (C)onfig

smtp-server =3D my.mailserver.example/user=3Dxyzzy

See if that works.

Sounds like you need to enable-incoming-folders in Main, Setup, Config,
and then add the folders you want to check for new mail to your Incoming
Folders collection.  Give that a try and get back to us if you have
trouble.

Hi!

I have problem with change default mail folder location in PINE. I try change
this using other pine.config file like this:

	pine -p pinerc_sony -P pine.conf

but this not work. If I check debbug message I got:


    Debug output of the Pine program (debug=2 debug_imap=0). Version 4.21

     default-saved-msg-fo : SAVED/SAVED
         postponed-folder : POSTPONES
           mail-directory : mail
			    ^^^^

In "pine.conf" file I set value "mail-directory" like this:

# Pine compares this value with the first folder collection directory.
# If they match (or no folder collections are defined), and the directory
# does not exist, Pine will create and use it. Default: ~/mail
mail-directory=/home/piotr/SONY

As You see from debbug output PINE don't set this catalog for new mail folder
location.

How to change default folder location?

Regards

Piotr

Subject: PC Pine - Retain login name/password information for session
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

I am installing PC Pine in a library public lab environment.  I have
looked through quite a few websites, archives, etc. and I believe that I
have answered my own question, but I'd like to post to this list to be
certain.

I've installed PC Pine with the values for the first two lines of pinerc
set as:

personal-name="" 
user-id=""

Upon Pine startup, users are prompted for a login name and password. Login
and access to their INBOX successfully follows.  The first time composing
a message, the user is prompted for a Personal Name, in addition to a
login name [defaults to previous entry], password, and User ID for From
Address [defaults to login name].  My question is, since the user has
already entered the login name and password when Pine was started, is
there a way to automatically enter and accept these values (login name,
password, User ID for From Address) for composing messages, rather than
the user having to confirm or re-enter them the first time a message is
composed?

Thanks,  Robert Gessner

Should be interesting to see how it fairs in the next few days before I
move it to the production environment :)

This may be a dumb question but.....

We hav used pine for years on a SUN UNIX system.  I am trying to up-grade
to 4.30.  I got the SUN binaries from the PIne ftp site.  However, when I
run the new version on our SUN, it doesn't seem to find the mail files:
every account comes up with an empty mail box even though I know there are
40+ messages in the accounts.  I have been unable to find any installation
information which might explain this problem.  CAn someone help me out
here?

Many thanks.

Okay, so I love the remote config of PC-Pine 4.30.  Pretty easy, although
my users might freak the first time I show them how to use it.  (Note to
developers: Who do we make the check out to? j/k)  Anyways...

I have two minor issues.

1. The remote_pinerc doesn't take into account any form letters that we
may have created in PC-Pine.  For instance, I have a number of generic
forms that I send to people for various tech related issues.  It would be
really cool if we could have a "remote_forms" file as well, so that I
could send form letters, no matter where I am.  (This is probably for the
suggestion box, but I want to see what other people think first.)

2. I'm getting an error message when I compose a message:

"{server-name}/usr/local/lib/imap/global_ad: Can't get write access to
mail."

Now, I DO know this has something to do with the global_addressbook for
imap, but I DON'T know precisely what the issue is, nor how to fix it.  I
guess I could tinker with the permissions and try to find something on the
pine site, but I don't have time to really investigate further until next
week and I am hoping someone can help me out.

Thanks,

RCL

Hi,

	I'm having trouble compiling pine 4.30 on Solaris 2.6 and Solaris
8 (both Sparc) with gcc 2.95.1 and 2.95.2, respectively.

	I get this:

$ build gs5
make args are CC=gcc
... snip ...
gcc -g -O2   -c  mbx.c
mbx.c: In function `mbx_hdrpos':
mbx.c:1371: internal error--unrecognizable insn:

        (minus:SI (const_int 4 [0x4])
            (const_int -4096 [0xfffff000]))) -1 (nil)
    (expr_list:REG_EQUAL (const_int 4100 [0x1004])
        (nil)))
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `mbx.o'

make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `gso'


--------	then it continues but at the end it says:


make: Fatal error: Don't know how to make target `../c-client/c-client.a'

Links to executables are in bin directory:
size: bin/pine: cannot open
size: bin/mtest: cannot open
size: bin/imapd: cannot open
bin/pico: 288693 + 5724 + 4088 = 298505
bin/pilot: 285901 + 5596 + 4088 = 295585
Done


	Any hints?  Has someone have been able to compile it on Solaris
2.x?

	Thanks,

fjac

Hi,

I have a problem with the scoring/filterin in pine. I tried to setup
following:

I defined a scoring for all emails addressed to my address
"jb@x-networks.de" with a score of 99. After that, I defined a filter for
all scores between -INF and 1 (-INF,1) in my inbox to move those emails to
the folder "notdirect".

All emails with a score of more than 1 should stay in the inbox, and all
others, that did'nt match the To:-Header should be moved, but this doesn't
work.

When I'm sorting for the score I can see, that spam mails, which are not
addressed to "jb@x-networks.de" are sorted to the top of the list. So the
scoring seems to be working. But the filtering doesn't. I even changed the
filter for filtering all matches for the scores -INF,+INF but even this
did'nt work. All emails remained in my Inbox and weren't moved to the
other folder as supposed to by this filtering-rule.

What am I doing wrong?

Thanks for your help!

Bye,

jb

I just built Pine 4.30 under Digital UNIX 4.0E and 4.0F.  For some reason,
both versions no longer see my global addressbooks.  If I go back to Pine
4.21 they magically reappear so there's nothing wrong with my config
files.  Anyone else run into this?

I'm very pleased that two of my enhancement requests were included in
4.30, and one of them having been made quite recently.

My only nit is that the segmenting of "patterns=" into
"patterns-indexcolors=" and "patterns-roles=", etc. in the config file
means that running the 4.30 on an old config ignores all the existing
roles.  Recreating patterns from scratch is a lot of work.  I worked
around this by using the -pinerc command line option to see what the
new variable names were, then sorting my patterns into the appropriate
new labels.  After that, all seems well so far.

The first time you run 4.30 it is supposed to read in the patterns
variable and sort them into the appropriate new patterns- vars for you. It
should do that if there isn't already a value in one of the new variables,
which it uses as a clue that 4.30 has been run before and the patterns
have already been copied. Do you think it failed to do the copy? Thanks.

Ah, good, that's what I expected it should do.  I think I know why it
didn't work for me:  I have been using the technique from Nancy's web
page to keep the main config in one file invoked with -P and the
exceptions in another file invoked with -p.  The patterns are in the
former, which does not get updated by pine.  The new -x feature would
have solved that problem if I had learned about that and changed my
shortcut before boldly dropping in the new binaries and cranking them
up.

I tried building Pine 4.30 on a BSD2.1 system, something I've done
successfully with versions 4.10 and 4.21. 
The build never completes. Instead, the following error is issued: 
_________________________________________________

Thus, pico and pilot are created in the bin directory but not Pine. 
I'm not a Unix expert by any means, but am gunzipping and using tar 
to create the Pine package and doing the build. 
I'm using the pine4.30.tar.gz package from the FTP site. 
Is there anything I can do to prevent this error? 
By the way, the precompiled freebsd binary works great on another
provider.

Hello All!
             I am having problems configuring Pine to send e-mail. When =
I try to compose a message and send it, I get this message:

[>Pipe can't access "/usr/lib/sendmail": No such file or directory<]=20

and it makes sense because the path for sendmail on the computer is =
"/usr/sbin/sendmail". How do I tell Pine to use the correct path? =
Thanks!

Don has found a bug. A configuration variable which is a list and which is
set _only_ in the fixed configuration file won't work. It will behave as
if it isn't set at all. If there is a non-NULL setting in the pine.conf
file, or the source code, or the personal config files, then things will
work correctly and the fixed setting will override those other settings. A
work-around is to also set it in the regular global configuration file,

Here is a fix - without it, it segfaults when phoning home (and other
places, like sending a mail, if you bypass it). The reason is that
functions can pass NULL to it.

Did you compile with DEBUG turned off? If so, this is really a symptom of
another bug.

Here is a patch. It will be fixed in the next version of
pine. You can work-around the problem by leaving DEBUG defined.

In .../pine/pine.c, move line 332, which looks like

    init_pinerc(pine_state);

Move that line up above line 319, which looks like

#ifdef DEBUG

The new feature to remember the destination from one save operation to
the next is very handy.  It would be even handier if it was remembered
across pine invocations!

Is there a way to compile pine to work with the Netscape iPlanet Directory
Server?  It doesn't have the liblber.a or the libldap libraries.

The binaries have LDAP client code included. If you are compiling pine
from source you will have to supply an LDAP library. OpenLDAP is the most
likely choice. Once you have a pine (or other client) with LDAP client
support, it should work with any LDAP Directory server. Did I understand
the question?
