Hello,

  Today I received a personal message with a "Newsgroup:" header. If I had
seen the same message in Pine4.53 I would have seen a warning

"Unverified Newsgroup header -- Message MAY or MAY NOT have been posted"

at the bottom of the screen. Pine4.56, however, did not give this warning.
This contributed significantly to make my reply go to the newsgroup.

In this case, no harm was done. However, I believe this is not a good
thing. this change was not documented in the Release Notes of Pine.

However, observe that the file "imap/docs/RELNOTES" says:

<Quote>
Updated: 28 May 2003

imap-2002d is a minor release, released concurrently with Pine 4.56, and
contains primarily bugfixes.  Programs written for imap-2002 should build
with this version without modification, with one exception.  That
exception is the ngbogus envelope flag, which stopped being used in
imap-2002c and is now gone for good.
</Quote>

The change described above caused the problem.  Could the old behavior be
brought back please? Thanks.

I looked at the code that generates this message when I wrote my
User-Agent patch for 4.56. The test you're refering to was called as
part of a relatively dirty piece of code (labeled as a kludge in the
comments) in 4.55 and below. They removed the kludge, but got rid of
that test as well, it seems.

Right, take a look at Nancy's web page and look at the link to the
"comp.mail.pine fiasco". Maybe it will change your mind, or maybe not. I
believe that this should not have changed, and since it changed it should
have been added to the Release Notes. It was done in secrecy. Bad idea in
my opinion. I believe the old behavior should be back.

I think I haven't been very clear in my original post. I totally agree
with you. I didn't advocate removing this piece of code, I was just
saying that, judging from what I have seen while working on the
User-Agent patch, the developers had gotten rid of that entire segment
of code in 4.56, including the Newsgroup header test.

I don't buy the conspiracy theory - presumably it was just a mistake.
They had the good idea to clean up some of the code, but unfortunately
ended up discarding something useful. That happens. That being said,
yes, I think it should be back too.

And added to the Pine test suite so it doesn't happen again!

		Hello!

	Imap-2002 has support for 1-byte to
1-byte character set translation. Pine has
some (rather strange to me) support for japan
multibyte to 1-byte translation.
	But I can't find support for translation
of other character tables. As for me, I need
UTF-8 -> KOI-8r translation. I can make a patch
for UTF-8 -> (cyrillic encodings) just like
it is done for japan. But adding another hack
(like japan multibyte) doesn't seem a good idea
to me.
	I'm rather new to pine source, so may be
somebody has a good idea, how to implement it?

		Bye. Alex.

You are correct that we did take out this behavior, and it is
unfortunately something that got left off of the Release Notes.  As
Nicolas Christin mentioned in his response, that piece of code was based
on a kludge, and we decided that that code made some rather arbitrary
assumptions that don't make sense anymore.

We took out the message entirely, as it seemed to us a message with very
little information, and one that probably confused more people than it
helped.  There are still safeguards to prevent messages from accidentally
getting sent out, such as the prompt to Post or Followup, and especially
the "Posted message may go to thousands of readers. Really post?".

Hi Jeff,

  There's one thing that is good about the kludge. It would have made me
check if the message actually went to the newsgroup before I replied. I
would not have replied to it and posted it in the newsgroup, had I known
any better.

  I suppose I can be considered a power user of Pine and none of the work
arounds that you suggest really work for me. I would not mind if I had to
enable this warning, but please do not just eliminate it.

  It's really useful, I mean it.

  Thank you for your consideration.

Eduardo

But what if the message you are replying to was a *personal*
email message that happens to have a Newsgroups header for
informational purposes only (i.e., it was not actually posted to
a Newsgroup)? It seems like we are back to the way things were
during "The 1995 Newsgroups Header Fiasco," which I talk about
here:

 <http://www.ii.com/internet/messaging/pine/#fiasco>

Is the kludge that you took out the one that checked for a Path
header? This (I hope) is not going to be as disasterous as it was
in 1995 because 1) there are not as many people using
newsreaders, such as nn, that include a Newsgroups header in
email-only message and 2) maybe less people are *both* posting
and emailing a reply because the world of email has turned into a
cesspool of spam and fake From addresses.

		Hello!

	Some mail lists rewrite "From" address of messages
to list address, inserting non-address part of it into
brackets. Like this:

    From: "Alexander V Alekseev" <alex@alemate.ru> 

becomes like this:
    From: <some@list.com> (Alexander V Alekseev)
or even like this:
    From: <some@list.com>(=?koi8-r?B?5MDLz9fBIOXLwdTF0snOwQ==?=)

    In such case, pine shows only list address in "From"
header field. Is the a way to see part in () ?

		Bye. Alex.

Oops, what I meant to say for #2 is:

 maybe there are less people now who send a reply to a newsgroup
 message with *only* an email message (as opposed to with only a
 news posting or with both a news posting and a cc'd email
 message) because the world of email has turned into a cesspool of
 spam and fake From addresses.

Alex:  Subject: "From" in message list.
Alex:
Alex:  		Hello!
Alex:
Alex:  	Some mail lists rewrite "From" address of messages
Alex:  to list address, inserting non-address part of it into
Alex:  brackets. Like this:
Alex:
Alex:      From: "Alexander V Alekseev" <alex@alemate.ru>
Alex:
Alex:  becomes like this:
Alex:      From: <some@list.com> (Alexander V Alekseev)
Alex:  or even like this:
Alex:      From: <some@list.com>(=?koi8-r?B?5MDLz9fBIOXLwdTF0snOwQ==?=)
Alex:
Alex:      In such case, pine shows only list address in "From"
Alex:  header field. Is the a way to see part in () ?
Alex:
Alex:  		Bye. Alex.



Have you tried turning on full headers?

	Yes. Of course it works (it would be strange, if it doesn't).
But:
     1) I can't see 'full headers' in message list.
     2) It's rather difficult to read undecoded mail (in full headers
        mode). ;-))

	Bye. Alex.

		Hello!

	BTW: pine has a bug in decoding. Header like this:
--------------------------------------------------------
Subject: Re: [apache-talk] Re[2]: [apache-talk]

--------------------------------------------------------
        is decoded only up to the 3rd line, leaving the last line "as
is". It looks like:

I *swear* I remember that at one time, you could do a "S"ave(? I think)
on an attached VCARD and Pine would prompt to save the readily-mapped
fields into your address book. Is this right, or am I on crack?

Hi Eduardo,

I'm still trying to figure out why the "Followup, Reply, or Both" prompt
and the "Posted message may go to thousands of readers. Really post?"
prompt are not sufficient enough to prevent most accidents from happening.
Also, why is the old message more useful at view time?  That the message
shows at view time seems unnecessary and distracting, wouldn't such a
message be more useful at compose time?

"Unverified Newsgroup Header" doesn't tell me much.  Any message not in a
newsgroup with a Newsgroup header is unverified, and it seems to me to be
overly paranoid to warn whenever a user views a such a message.

It's easy enough to add a warning back into the code.  I am soliciting
from you your suggestions as to when such a message should appear (and
under what conditions), and why you don't think the two prompts are
enough.  We'll probably just do whatever you suggest.

Thanks,
Jeff

Hi Jeff,

  I think we agree on this point. I wish I could find a way to replace
"most" by "all" in your above quoted sentence.

:) Also, why is the old message more useful at view time?  That the
:) message shows at view time seems unnecessary and distracting, wouldn't
:) such a message be more useful at compose time?

  I see your point, but I am not sure when it would be convenient to see
this message. I find it more of a problem when you actually compose the
reply of the message, because verifying that the message was posted (or
not), ultimately decides where are you going to send your reply. In my
case, this would mean that I would receive the warning twice, for as long
as that message lasted in the screen. It would become annoying very
rapidly.

:) "Unverified Newsgroup Header" doesn't tell me much.  Any message not in
:) a newsgroup with a Newsgroup header is unverified, and it seems to me
:) to be overly paranoid to warn whenever a user views a such a message.

Granted, but the kludge tried to identify clients that used the newsgroup
header in the way that you intended it to be used (as a signal that the
message had been sent to a newsgroup), so for example, messages posted and
mailed by Pine did not get that warning. That's a good compromise I think.

Of course, the ideal would be not to have that kludge, but I can't see a
way to eliminate it either. I got an e-mail which proves to me that that
kludge is still useful.

:) It's easy enough to add a warning back into the code.  I am soliciting
:) from you your suggestions as to when such a message should appear (and
:) under what conditions), and why you don't think the two prompts are
:) enough.  We'll probably just do whatever you suggest.

I've been thinking about this, and I am quite convinced that I want this
warning before I press the 'R' key to reply.

Here there are two ideas:

1) To keep the old behavior exactly as it was (that means to return the
   ngbogus field to the c-client library, and all the old code taken from
   Pine), but I would change the text of the warning. Here are some ideas:

  "Newsgroup header indicates that this message MAY have been posted"

  "This message MAY have been posted (verify before replying)"

2) To add a handle at the bottom of the message that says something like

  [ Note: Message MAY have been posted. Verify it now ]

  following that handle would take you to a screen with the list of all
  the newsgroups in the newsgroup fields, which when selected allow you to
  open the above said newsgroup, where you can check if the message was
  posted by looking at the index. I'm not quite sure that this is a god
  idea but I thought I would comment on it, instead of deleting it totally
  from this message.

   The drawbacks of the first and second method are the same. Even if the
message was posted, there's no reason to believe that it will be in the
newsgroup in, say, 15 days, so actually verifying that the message was
posted may turn out unsuccessful, but what is good, is that there was a
warning, and so you'll think twice when you hit the 'R' key to reply about
what you want to do next with your message.

Hello all -

Not so much a bug, as a request for some advice...

We use Pine on a few servers (differing versions, but this seems to affect
all of them - 4.44 for example) to connect to our IMAP server.

We previously used Sun Internet Mail Server, SIMS version 4. When a
directory was created (as opposed to a mail folder), it appeared with a
[/] suffix - and hitting "Enter" or ">" took you to a listing of the mail
folders (or other directories) within. Probably because Pine knew SIMS
didn't support having mail in a directory, just in folders..

We migrated this weekend to Sun One Messaging (also known as iPlanet
Messaging Server), version 5.2. All of a sudden every folder is now a
directory with a [/] suffix - probably just a "feature" of the migration.

That's livable. Here's the problem. Any directories from before (not
folders, directories) at first appeared to have nothing in them. What we
eventually discovered was the distinction between using the ">" key to
enter the directory and see the sub-folders (which were all there) and
using the "Enter" key to view messages actually in the directory (of which
there were none).

So.... long story short... isn't there any way to make this more
intuitive? For example, have "Enter" list the sub-directories if there's
no actual mail in the directory itself? Or have it so that when you hit
"Enter" it shows you the sub-directories *and* the mail itself (or at
least an option saying "View mail in this actual directory?)

Right now, we have users who think they have "lost" mail folders because
they enter a directory and see nothing when using the "Enter" key. We are
trying to re-educate them, but it seems like there should be a better way.
I've searched the setable options, and don't see anything on point for
this.

Thanks for any help!

Does the last line really look like what I quote it above?

While the two lines above it look like containing valid encoded-words
as specified, in RFC 2047, it looks the last line is not a 'encoded-word'
like I read http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2047.txt.

Naturally speaking it says:

| Generally, an "encoded-word" is a sequence of printable ASCII characters
| that begins with "=?", ends with "?=", and has two "?"s in between.

The exact syntax is:

| encoded-word = "=?" charset "?" encoding "?" encoded-text "?="

More rules apply, but this is the basic requirement for an 'encoded-word'
and it must not contain line breaks, so even if the "?=" would come later,
it would be too late.

To a human, the last line looks like containing such 'encoded-word', but
while the word suspectible to be a 'encoded-word', it does not end with "?=",
and so it does not conform to the syntax covered by RFC 2047, as I read it,
so it has to be displayed as-is, which pine does.

Maybe it conforms to an other RFC which tells how to handl such strings,
but I don't know it, but I'm also not an expert in these issues.

> --------------------------------------------------------

This looks correct according to RFC 2047 to me, the last line does
not contain anything which is covered by it, and I think at least
pine does not implement other RFCs for MIME Message Header Header
Extensions which encode non US-ASCII strings.

My assumption is that the message may have been corrupted on the
way to pine, maybe by the sending email program. Maybe it has
a limited number of bytes it can use internally to handle long
encoded subject strings and maybe this limit has been reached
or even overflown(which would be bad for the user of this program)

Maybe you want to ask the sender if his program crashed some time
after sending this mail(which would also have security implications)

The European Parliament has postponed the vote on the software patent directive,
enforcing 30.000 patents on abstract rules as used in software back to the
original date of 1st of September, thereby rejecting initially successful
efforts to rush to vote on June 30th. There is time again, but not much:

	It seems, it's bug on sender side. Searching in mail archive,
I found exactly last line as a substring of another encoded line.
So, it's really corrupted.

As I read through the various mailing lists, I often flag messages as
Important.  A question just occured to me:

Will Pine support different levels of importance, or shall I say priority?
Something that can be easily seen whether
     index-format=IMAPSTATUS      or
     index-format=STATUS

I would love to see this in future releases.

Suggestion: Instead of using a *, use a numbering system (1-5) like the
            X-Priority header uses.

That's right. It still seems to work for me. It is Save. Maybe pine isn't
recognizing it as a genuine VCARD attachment.

This is the part of the old code that will most likely not be returning.
The new behavior would warn for ALL messages in non-nntp mailboxes that
have a Newsgroup header.  The presence of "Pine" in the Message-id is by
no means an indication that the message was posted.  I'm now picturing a
warning to be shown after a user says to Followup this type of message,
saying something like "Replying to message that may or may not have been
posted to newsgroup".  Unless I hear any objections, consider it added.

Hi Jeff,

  Consider my earlier message my objection. What will happen will be that
a user will press 'R' to reply, they'll recive the warning, cancel the
reply to check if the message was posted (which may take a long time),
then go back to the folder, press 'R' again and see the same message
again, for as many seconds as that will take (3 to 4 seconds of inactivity
each time?).

   I find this worse than the old behavior.

   Thank you for your consideration.

Eduardo

Eduardo,

I do not think identifying a few clients is the way to go. The kludge
was pretty horrible. It was checking against a few "good" MUAs, with
some ad-hoc tests, such as verifying the Message-ID starts with "Pine.".
Needless to say, a simple patch such as moving the "Pine" field to a
User-Agent header would break the whole thing. (That's why my User-Agent
patch was _not_ a two-liner in 4.55 and below.) In addition, as far
as I remember, the kludge did not check against some more recent
newsgroup readers such as slrn, Mozilla, did not check the presence of a
User-Agent field, etc.

I, for one, am glad this kludge is gone. On the other hand, any other
method of identifying that the Newsgroup header has been properly used
would be very welcome.

If you don't see any way of doing that other than checking for a few
"reasonable" mailers (which again I think is a bad idea), I suggest you
revisit the kludge in question. Move the Pine.ABC.xxx to the User-Agent
field (see the patch for that to save you some effort), and test whether
a User-Agent field has been set. Except for pine, pretty much all
"reasonable" mailers/newsreaders use one.

I think we should look at this warning as a measure to prevent people from
shooting themselves in the foot.  Someone that is concerned about the
legitimacy of the mail they're responding to can take the time to verify
it as they see fit, whether it be by trusting the message-id header or by
opening the newsgroup to check for the message.

What Nicolas Christin says is spot on.  There are so many "trustworthy"
news readers that to compare against a list of them is futile.  Also,
those headers can easily be faked.

Hi Jeff,

I was not talking about the way that Pine checks for trustworthiness of
the fact that the message was posted (I'll talk about this later). What I
said was that it is annoying to have a message that will be there for 4
seconds at least twice in the screen. It's disruptive, especially the
second time.

I admit that one would like to have a system of checking for
trustowrthiness of the newsgroup header that does not depend on the
newsreader used by the sender, that may not possible yet and simply
declaring that it can not be done and ignoring the extra information is a
complete disregard of the reality that we live in and where Pine should
fit in. I think Pine needs to try harder, whatever method you decide to
use to do this.

I believe that the old behavior, even though not perfect, and maybe a
kludge, was far better that what you are going to do now. I guess we'll
have to agree to disagree and I will have to hack Pine. So glad I don't
have to use PC-Pine.

:) Also, those headers can easily be faked.

There are so many headers that can and are faked, I haven't seen anyone
protesting about verifying the FROM field in the index, even when it's
wrong. Why?, because every one seems to either believe it 100% (like in a
personal message), or disregard it (like in spam). In fact, this header is
used to construct the To: header in a reply. Maybe you should be doing the
case that Pine should give a warning saying "From field not verified".

When Pine sorts by thread, it has to use the Date field, which is
unverified. In fact, there are many fields that are used and all of them
can be faked. Not because of this, Pine does not do threads. You are free
to use as many fields as you can to determine a thread.

The fact is that Pine does not verify any headers, so saying that you
can't trust a newsgroup header ever is simply stating something that Pine
does with any field, it does not single out the newsgroup header. As with
threads, you can use as many fields as you like to determine if a message
was posted to a newsgroup with a certain degree of certainty. As you know,
not even the algorithm for threads is 100% fool proof, not everything is
correctly threaded, but nobody is going to stop using threads because of
this. People will encourage you to use more fields (or the fields that
you used in a better way) if they know what was missing when threading was
done. I hereby encourage you to use the message-id (or other headers) to
determine certainty that the message was posted, and if you have a good
certainty that the message was posted do not make me wait for 8 seconds
until the message is gone.

Thanks,

Eduardo

How do I configure pine (under unix) so that I can read an attachment with
an external program? I'd like to be able to open PDF attachments with xpdf
and MS-WORD files with antiword without having to extract the files.

Make sure that the MIME-type of the attachment is correct, and add the
application to handle it in your mailcap file. You may want to add an
entry to your mime.types file to identify extensions with MIME-types.

That may not be sufficent.  If Mats is running under X (or CDE, etc),
2 commands might need to be executed:


As root:  xhost + localhost
As user:  setenv DISPLAY :0


In my situation, Im in CDE (under Solaris 9) as root, yet Im checking my
email through a dtterm as my non-privleged self.

My non-privleged account uses Netscape to view URLs and image attachments,
but without those 2 commands, Netscape will not attach to root's CDE
screen.


Just something to think about.

That refers only to when your Pine session is running under different
privileges than your X session.

Many Unix flavors support setting the XAUTHORITY env var to the path to
the .Xauthority file you want to use.

	You're right. But that works only if you need to start X
applications under only one user, other than root. (Because file must not
be readable by users other than root and the user we expect to. That's
why, we have to "chown our_user ~root/.Xauthority" to let it work,
and also give all(or only that one) users access to the directory with
it. Really, it's usually much more difficult to do, than just copy file.)

I've added the following lines to .mailcap,

  Application/MSWORD;/usr/local/bin/antiword %s
  Application/PDF;/usr/X11R6/bin/xpdf %s

When I try a PDF attachment, it works as expected, but for MSWORD
attachment, something seems to happen in the background, but it is not
shown to me. Do I have to open an xterm window in some way?

I've never used antiword, so I don't know.

Try writing a wrapper script around antiword and using that as the
application for word attachments.

Put a sleep at the end of the wrapper script, so you have time to see
what happens before it ends.

Hi,

I just installed v4.56 on my PC after having been a pine
user under Unix for about 10 years.

I have some questions that I couldn't find in the archives.

1) Is there a way to do away with having to type my password
each time I log in to the POP3 server where my mail is
gathered?

2) Is there a way to tranfer all my saved message folders
(with contents) from the Unix box to my PC?

3) When I delete a message in PC Pine, it seems to also
delete it from the POP3 server. Is that the only way
messages on the server are managed?

Thanks,
Pete

You have a config variable called "last-time-prune-questioned". Set it
back a month. That is, change it from 103.8 to 103.7.

that the program will crash (no core) after I add an attachment to the
Attchmnt field.

Recently, while using PINE 4.50, I sent out an email with
attachments.  The recipient couldn't view the attachments.
The recipient couldn't find them anywhere.  When the recipient
decided to forward the message to me so I could see the problem,
while using M$ IE, the attachments appeared.  Is PINE causing the
attachments to be included without meeting all RPC requirements
and is it compatible with all email readers?  In the past, this
hasn't happened.  Has anyone else experienced this type of fluke?

Yes, I have seen this with Pine 4.53 on Mac OS X. One user of MS Outlook
(Outlook 2003, I think? on Windows XP) can never see the attachments I
send him, even though they are in his attachments folder when he checks
there.

This is why the microsoft programmers have implemented the RFC for
MIME-attachments in Outlook incorrectly. The RFC says [BASE64] could
write with upper case or lower case characters but M$ has only coded the
lower case version. Pine uses the upper case characters.

Hope that helps.

Here is the help text for the pine option "quell-content-id". Maybe
setting this option would help.

                           FEATURE: quell-content-id

This feature changes the behavior of Pine when sending messages. It is
intended to work around a bug in Microsoft's Outlook XP mail user agent.
As of this writing, Microsoft has acknowledged the bug but has not added
it to the Knowledge Base. We have been told that there will be a post-SP1
hotfix for Outlook XP. This particular bug has bug fix number
OfficeQFE:4781. The nature of the bug is that messages with attachments
which contain a Content-ID header (which standard Pine attachments do) do
not show the attachment indicator (a paperclip) when viewed with Outlook
XP. So the user has no indication that the message contains an
attachment.

If this feature is set then Pine will remove most Content-ID headers
before sending a message. If an attachment is of type MESSAGE, then the
existing Content-ID headers inside the message will be left intact. This
would only happen with Pine if a message was forwarded as an attachment
or if a message with a message attached was forwarded. Similarly if an
attachment of type MULTIPART/ALTERNATIVE is forwarded, the Content-ID
headers of the alternative parts will not be removed.

Because the Content-ID header is a standard part of MIME it is possible
that setting this feature will break something. For example, if an
attachment has a Content-ID header which is necessary for the correct
functioning of that attachment, it is possible that Pine may remove that
header when the attachment is forwarded. However, it seems fairly safe at
this time.

I have my Pine 4.55 setup with:
  url-viewers = /usr/dt/bin/netscape

But it never runs in the background.  I cannot append the & to the end.
Anyway to get url-viewers to run the background?



Thanks.

Howdy good people.
Well this is a poser but I reckon I'm in the right place. I'm switching
isp's. Not happy with earthlink anymore. too much for too little, however
be that as it may, when I try and log onto the pop3 server using my local
addition of pine it says
security problem insecure server advertised
pop3 authentication cancelled
So
I give tech support at ev1.net a clang and they said that most email
clients have a security setting that needs to be unchecked to use their
system. So
I went and looked in the pine config but could not find anything like that
to
do with security, and boys and girls they's a lot you can configure.
Anybody got any clues on this one?? If you need any further illucidation
let me know. I wanna use this isp like really bad. Save me 11 bucks a
month.
On the advice of a friend I tried putting /notls after the pop 3 server
address, and got a totally new error message saying auth plain. near as I
could make out I'm a blind fella using a braille display. also
checked out the pine tech notes and found
disable-these-authenticators, but couldn't find that listing in the
config of my version of pine 4.33. I should perhaps tell you I'm
using the braille notetaker called the elba 20 Please send any and all
helpful hints or insulting
remarks to mailto:bluesman@sdf.lonestar.org  thanks for any help. at
all..
Jack

Hey All,

I just upgraded my Mac to OSX and am using Terminal to get to my server's
shell and to Pine.  All of my command keys work in Pine except ^O,
Postpone.  I've gone through every configuration option in Terminal I can
find and can't seem to figure out why ^O will not work.  Can anyone solve
this frustrating problem for me??

Thanks so much,

I use pine 4.53 (installed by fink) on OS X, 10.2.6, and do not see this
problem. I have always been able to postpone messages using ^O in the
Terminal. (You are using the letter 'o', not the number zero, right?)

Feel free to email me privately for details on my Terminal configuration.

We've kicked this solution around on -discussion.  My .pinerc
reads:

url-viewers=/fs/scd/home0/era/bin/ns7

The "ns7" script invokes netscape7 into the background.  The baroque
"if" tests are left over from netscape4 and probably don't work
correctly for netscape7, er, mozilla.

#!/bin/sh
# short script to invoke netscape7 from within pine as a background
# process, so pine can continue.  Only arg is the URL.
# Author: Ed Arnold <era@ucar.edu> , but modified by Mike Miller & John

#

#

    cp $URL ${URL}.html
    URL=${URL}.html
fi

I have experienced similar problems with ^U in editor mode.
Use <ESC> + <ESC> + <O>. This should work.

Hi,

Our mailing system removes virus attachments from our emails, and leaves
us with the following in the message body:

--------
Please see the attached file for details.

    [ Part 2, "The Original Attachment has been REPLACED"  Text/PLAIN ]
    [ (Name: "virus_removed_by_FNAL-Postmaster.txt")  27 lines. ]
    [ Not Shown. Use the "V" command to view or save this part. ]

---------

I wanted to add a filter to throw out messages containing the string 
"virus_removed_by_FNAL" in the text, however this string does not seem to 
be recognized.  I think this is because the underscore "_" is not being 
interpreted properly.

I tried doing matches for:

Alltext pattern = virus_removed

	and 

Alltext pattern = virus\_removed

(
LIT:pattern="/NICK=virus 2/ALL=virus\\_removed/FLDTYPE=SPEC/FOLDER=INBOX" 
action="/FILTER=1/FOLDER=garbage/NOKILL=1",
        
LIT:pattern="/NICK=virus/ALL=virus_removed/FLDTYPE=SPEC/FOLDER=INBOX" 
action="/FILTER=1/FOLDER=garbage/NOKILL=1",
)

but none of these work.   Am I missing something ?

-Ben

We just migrated to a new HP Alpha box running Tru64 UNIX 5.1B.  I've
compiled Pine 4.56 and it's working fine except for creating auxiliary
indexes for global addressbooks.  Whenever I use "pine -create_lu", I get
"Segmentation fault (core dumped)".  It creates the .lu file but it's not
sorted at all.  Are there any known problems with this option?

I've been using Pine for years, and recently our OS was upgraded,
including a new version of Pine, so it's now Pine 4.53

Now I find that whenever I use Pine, it seems to automatically transfer
new messages from my mailbox ( /var/mail/jeremy )
to the file I use to store messages ( ~jeremy/mbox )

The local support staff know nothing about it, its certainly nothing
they've set up to make it do this.

Short of reading through the entire on-line help, I can't seem to find
anything there about this "feature" and how I can stop it.

Can anyone help?

Thanks,

Jeremy

My company just started refusing anonymous binds from outside the
firewall to our company LDAP address book.  To access the address book
from outside the firewall we now have to bind over SSL and authenticate
with a DN.  From looking through the doc tree in the source as well as
Google web and groups, I can not find any information on Pine being able
to work in our new environment.  Is that correct?  If Pine can support
non-anonymous binds over SSL, can you point me to some docs on how to
set it up.  (This is for both UNIX Pine as well as PC-Pine and we
already build UNIX Pine with SSL, LDAP and Kerberos support so it is not
a "need to be built with..." issue.)

Thanks.

Wow seems like quite a bit:

I should give it shot.  You covered areas I wouldnt of have thought of

Dear Don,

  You are right, there is a bug. The problem is that a collator function
is left undefined in Pine until after Pine analyzes the arguments that it
was given. A patch that fixes this bug (in a bad, but effective way) can
be found in my web page. I am sure somebody will come up with a better
solution than this patch.

  You can download the patch from my web page, address below.

As of the time I asked last year, that appears to be right.

Shame, too- 'cause I'd *really* prefer to use the company's address
book (but at the same time, wondering why they're so anal about it,
as they should at least allow anonymous access *within* the local net).

That is quite an FAQ.  The short story is:  Delete/rename/move 
the ~/mbox file and do not run any software which recreates the 
file.  If the file exists when pine starts, it will use mbox.

Alternatively, disable mbox support either in the config file, or 
at compile time so that the annoying mbox driver isn't present at 
all.  Details in the pine documentation, or on the web.

Hope this helps.

Dear pine users,

I suddenly saw the message '63 messages expunged from folder "INBOX"'
appearing... I'm not aware that I had deleted some messages, nor pressed
eXpunge, and wondered what messages I had lost... but while looking at the
log, it seems I actually did not loose any messages...? The number of
messages in my inbox now is 369.

So where comes this message of expunged 63 messages from?

Regards,

Eduardo, I looked at your web page and it's not obvious which patch I
should use.  Could you give me a hint?  Thanks.

I'm not sure that anyone can tell you why your messages were supposedly
expunged, because you told us nothing else about your Pine session.

Sorry... I forgot to tell that I'm using Pine 4.56 on a linux box,
accessing an imap folder on the mail server.

Apart from that, I didn't do anything special...just suddenly saw the
message on the screen, but with no reason, as far as I can see...
Apparently, after reading the log, and knowing that the number of messages
was 369 afterwards, it should be quite clear that a 63 message expunge has
not happened... So why did I get that message?

What else information could I provide?

The log that you posted had *two* strange messages
- first that 63 new messages had been received and
only then the message you are mentioning, that 63
messages had been expunged.

> What else information could I provide?

What have you done to find out what were the 63
messages that you received?

I had this same problem, but solved it.  Here's how:

1. I installed stunnel on my client machine (www.stunnel.org), create
   a cert and use a similar config to:

# stunnel.conf
cert=/usr/local/etc/stunnel.pem

client=yes

#debug=7
#foreground=yes

pid=/var/run/stunnel.pid

[ldaps]
accept=389
connect=your.ldap.server_here:636

   And startup your stunnel service.

2. Modify the pine source code.  This really only works if you are 
   doing a lookup against 1 ldap server, but it would be simple to
   add a loop through multiple credentials.

   - edit pine/bldaddr.c
   - find the ldap_lookup() function, and the ldap_simple_bind_s()
     function call (in 4.56 this is at line 5344).
   - change the NULL, NULL arguments to the login DN and password.
     for example:

	 if(ldap_simple_bind_s(ld, NULL, NULL) != LDAP_SUCCESS){

	 becomes

	 if(ldap_simple_bind_s(ld, 
	    "cn=Joe User,cn=Users,dc=Company,dc=Domain,dc=com",
	    "mypassword") != LDAP_SUCCESS){

   - save the file off.
   - compile

3. Run your new pine exe

4. Config your directory server entry to point to localhost:389,
   and the correct search base.

5. Enjoy ssl and authenticated ldaps access from pine.

That being said, it _really_ should not be that hard to add this to
the UI, so that instead of passing NULL NULL, a user DN/password is
passed.   A person with more spare time than I could make up a patch
following the other numerous pine patches to at least add authenticated
ldap support to the mailer.   A person with even more spare time than
that could leverage the existing imaps code and maybe the service
parsing syntax to add ssl support to that.

Daniel,

You're right, it's probably the 63 new messages that has been expunged...
Could it be related to the new spam filter that my ISP just activated for
my account...?

If you look at his logs, what *I* think happened is that "Telephone
Answering" sender (I'm presuming this is some sort of automated telephone
thing that can send E-mail, Like Toshiba's "Stratus") hiccuped and
accidentally sent 63 bogus(?) messages, then perhaps the admin realized
the mistake and wiped 'em from the spool file.

Hello,
	Wondering where i can find a howto on roles and the specific information
to get my custom and default headers to show? I've checked the user's
guide and the faq, but i was hoping for something a little more detailed.
Thanks.
Dave.

How can I configure pc-pine to properly access the pop account on starband.net?
If anyone has done this, I would sure appreciate some guidance.
Thanks!

(I just installed pc-pine 4.56 on a windows machine (98 millenium). That
machine is connected to the starband satellite modem, and shares the
connection out using Proxy+ software. The network has 3 other windoze
machines, and one linux box. I'd like eventually to get pc-pine running on
all of the windows machines. Can they all share one mailbox, or how? I
presume pc-pine has a pop fetcher built into it? Right now, the inbox-path
is {pop.starband.net/pop3}inbox - that seems not to work. I'm sort of a
klutz when it comes to configuring email, and I know nothing about how it
works on windows.)

Hello!

I'm using pine 4.55 and i sort my INBOX by thread.
threading-display-style=show-thread-structure

That means, that new messages, that refer to an older thread, are not
displayed at the end of my INBOX.

Is there a possibility to sort the threads by date, so that threads are
placed at the end of the index if a new message arrived?

Thorsten Jungeblut
