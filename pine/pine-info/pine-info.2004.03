As you can see, nothing strange (no pun intended).

Is this something on my end, or something in the message, that is causing
the Formatting error message to show up?

LETH is thriving as an emerging world leader in the conversion of waste 
materials into electrical energy by utilizing their Biosphere Process Syst=
em, 
making them the hottest undervalued stock at this price level where shares=
 
are ready to explode on huge investor attention.

Sales have rocketed beyond all estimates for LETH with no signs of 
slowing. The numbers continue to stack-up as sales orders for the Biospher=
e 
exceed $150 Million over the past year while the stock price doesn't yet 
reflect the appearance of these impressive figures on an upcoming balance =

sheet. We are not the first to uncover this phenomenon as the stock is und=
er 
accumulation, but we are acting aggressively on this recently filed data.

The unique proprietary technology of the Biosphere fills an urgent 
worldwide need for cost-effective renewable energy sources and a 
corresponding universal need to solve critical problems in the disposal of=
 
waste. The Biosphere System provides the highest level of innovative 
technology while securing worldwide acceptance for a revolutionary product=
 
designed to significantly impact the global waste problem while 
simultaneously generating electricity. 

The Biosphere System enables LETH to draw revenue from the disposal of 
various types of waste at 5 to 7 tons per hour including such materials as=
:
Municipal Solid Waste, refinery wastes, agricultural surpluses or effluent=
s, 
medical waste, industrial waste, shale oil, sour natural gas, and the huge=
 
market of used tires are all converted in the Biosphere Process. LETH also=

profits from the sale of electricity created from the waste conversion on =
a 
continuous basis by generating 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of electricity =

which is then sold to replenish the local or national grid. 

LETH is an alliance partner with Tetra Tech, Inc. (NASDAQ: TTEK, $20) a 
leader and one of the largest providers in environmental, mechanical, and =

electrical management consulting services primarily for the US Government =

with annual sales of $800 Million. Tetra Tech will coordinate permitting, =

installation and continuous worldwide monitoring of the Biosphere Process =

System for LETH. Tetra Tech is now in the process of obtaining Department =

of Environmental Quality permitting for the Biosphere Process in the state=
 of 
Louisiana. This is a monumental event for LETH which opens the 
floodgates for major project revenues in Louisiana while having a parallel=
 
effect on LETH stock in the form of a huge near-term announcement. 

LETH has begun to catch the profit-making attention of investors by 
embracing a major foothold on the global waste problem while a major push =

for generating electricity from alternative sources continues to be the ho=
t 
topic due to shortages and massive power failures. LETH contains all the 
ingredients for major profits as global demand to solve two crisis areas, =

waste and electrical energy, reaches unprecedented levels. We view this 
perfectly timed convergence of events as the catalyst for additional contr=
acts 
that will perpetuate the shattering of the Company's own sales records. We=
 
are seeing substantial gains for early investors in a ground floor opportu=
nity 
that carries our highest rating for short-term trading profits.

Hi all,

I've been searching the archives, and aside from someone in 2001 saying it
wasn't working for them, I was wondering if anyone's been able to do what
I want to do:

My PC is dual-boot -- Windows 2000 (probably soon to be Windows XP
Professional) and RedHat Linux 9.  I'm currently just getting my mail on
the Windows side with PC-Pine from a POP3 server.  The mailboxes and
pinerc are on a FAT32 partition (drive F:) which I mount as /F on the
Linux side.

I need to be on each side of this system relatively equally, and ideally
would love to use pine and pc-pine to hit the same mailboxes.

Last I knew (doing some experiments back when I was reading pine on a Sun
and put PC-pine on my home Windows box), the end-of-line difference
between Windows and unix/Linux made this not work properly, but I'm
surprised not to see lots of requests for getting this to work somehow.

So, can any/all of the following be done (easily, or with workarounds):

- Read the mailboxes on both sides without one side of this causing
corruption? (vital)

- Get my pop3 mail to my INBOX, and send mail from either side (vital)

- Read the .pinerc and appropriately apply/ignore options (not as vital --
I can just remember to update one with any changes in, say filtering
rules, or write a perl script or something to do it).

If I can get this working, my last major dual-boot unhappiness will be
solved. :)

Thanks,

- Rick

Why don't you just use IMAP?  I _think_ that will solve part of your
problems, since the mail will just be on the server, and it doesn't matter
where you access it from.. you can even access it from multiple clients
simultaneously, which you can't do with POP.

Hello,

Any news on port of version 4.58 to Cygwin 1.5? Can we expect the same

What do you mean? Is the port not working for you? Did you download it

IMAP will solve some problems, but if you need your boxes on a local
filesystem you could configure this in .pinerc.
You must set "sentmail", "savemail" and other used folders on Unix to
the path of your mounted Win partition.
Another way is to set an rsync at login/logout to sync your local boxes
between win and Unix. In this case you should convert your windows mail
folders to Unix line end.
Backup up your local folders before you do this. the folders could crash
sometimes on win.

Hope that helps

Bye Rico

the shutdown of operation systems says nothing about the reachability of
their filesystems. the data of mail folders is on a physical volume. after
Unix boot partition on harddrive which is used by Win could mount. in this
case you could say on login or in boot-scripts

rsync -av --delete ${PATH_to_mounted_win_drive}/${Mail Path}/ ~user/Mail/

and on logout or in halt-scripts in the other way.

that's right, the reasons for central mail servers and folders are for
instance:

-central backup
-big volumes with enough space
-reachability from any point on the net

Since I've always used rsync between two separate running systems
(remote sync) I hadn't thought about syncing two folders on the same
running system. But why, in this case, use rsync at all, instead of
directly accessing the same mail store in Win and Linux? Is rsync doing
DOS to UNIX file format conversion (you could simply use dos2unix /
unix2dos for that)... what is the 'added value' of rsync here?

the only reasons to use rsync on the same system are to get a local backup
of the mailfolders and you don't need to change the default values in
.pinerc. The better way is to set the mounted folders in .pinerc. This was
my first thought I wrote in the first mail.
IMHO rsync can't use dos2unix or unix2dos online. but if you need this
feature try to pipe the data.

Forgive me my pedantry, but that doesn't explain the added value of
rsync.

If I recall correctly, rsync (even local) requires running a daemon, no?
What I'm getting at is that how is rsync different from plain old "cp
-R" to move those files around? Sure, the rsync might only copy
differences, but with most mail folders on a local harddisk is the extra
effort really worth it?

And this is why I use rsync. rsync transfers only differences and files
which are deleted would also remove from the destination. in case of use
of cp -R deleted files stay in destination directory til the day you
remove it manually.
if you use rsync on local system the daemon will start automatically only
for the sync process even if you start rsync on console to sync
directories.

If you're having trouble with mailboxes that are in mbox format,
try using c-client MBX format. I think that this format, which is
better in a lot of ways, should work with both Unix- and PC-Pine
(and not need any end-of-line adjustments). I have some
information and lots of links about Pine's mailbox formats here:

 <http://www.ii.com/internet/messaging/pine/#wishFormat>



> - Get my pop3 mail to my INBOX, and send mail from either side (vital)

To do get your pop3 mail, use Pine's Maildrop feature, which I
discuss here:

 <http://www.ii.com/internet/messaging/pine/pc/#mvMaildrop>

To send from either side, set smtp-server to the appropriate SMTP
server (or list of servers).

You can run Pine with commands like this:

 pine -p pinerc-shared -x pinerc-windows
 pine -p pinerc-shared -x pinerc-linux

where the -x (exceptions) pinerc contains settings that are
specific to that system. I discuss this in detail here:

 <http://www.ii.com/internet/messaging/pine/sharing/>

Let us know if you get this working.
Good luck,
Nancy

Hello,

Not a big issue? but then I'm saving attachment from message in some
character sets, Pine propose me file name with "[encoding name]" in it.

Screenshot is here:

Hi List,

I am trying to view Microsoft attachments with Pine on OS X 10.3

I set up my .mime.types file with this:
Application/VND.MS-EXCEL	xsl

I set up my .mailcap file with this:
Application/VND.MS-EXCEL; open %s

Now when I get an excel file, I can type ">" a few times (or "v") to
view the attachment. Excel gets started up as it should, but nothing
appears.

If I go to the attachment and type "A" to learn about it, it says it
will open with the following command:
                Display Method  : "open <datafile>"

But <datafile> never shows up...

Any suggestions?

Thanks,
  -k.

Is "open" the name of the application?

Have you tried with the full path to "open" binary?

yes it is.

on Mac OS X the "open" command is used from the
command line to open any file. It spawns the correct
app.

% open foo.ppt  # launches powerpoint
% open bar.pdf   # launches the Mac PDF viewer

Yes. But as I wrote above open launches excel as it
should. So the open command is executing. It is
determining the file-type (.xls), launching the
correct helper application (Excel). But Excel is not
displaying a file.

I figured out one problem: The tmp file that pine
generates in the /var/tmp/ folder does not stick
around long enough. Pine deletes it right away, so
Excel cannot access it.

Any idea how I can get pine to delete its tmp files at
the end of a session rather than right away?

Have you tried to specify the excell binary directly instead?

It might be that pine forks off process A (open) which in turn forks off
process B (excel) and then A terminates instead of waiting until B has
terminated. Then it could be that pine removes the temporary file when
process A terminates.

Specifying that excel should open might solve that problem.

============

There doesn't seem to be a difference if I look at the full headers or not, it
still shows the error message.  Tried exporting the message to a file, and
that didn't work either (gave the same error, followed by "Error on export:
Success" though the file was zero-bytes).

Viewing the message in Squirrelmail, I see the whole thing:

read the documentation (INSTALL) and/or check the code. 
INSTALL says :

  and 5.6.1 seem to be most predictable. If UTF8/Unicode Perl support

If It was changed, RELEASE_NOTES would also mention it.

For completeness, running Postfix 2.0.4, amavisd-new-20030314, and Cyrus IMAPD

OK, I got it all solved...

The problem was two-fold. As Matt said, the process
was forking and returning, so pine deleted the tmp
file. The second is that open doesn't use the magic
and/or mime-type properties correctly, but bases its
information on file extension. And pine doesn't
provide mime-type file extensions for its temp files.

So my solution is two-fold:

This is the contents of my .mailcap folder in my home
directory:


Application/VND.MS-Excel; exec open -a
'/Applications/Microsoft Office X/Microsoft Excel' %s
Application/MSWORD; exec open -a
'/Applications/Microsoft Office X/Microsoft Word' %s
Application/OCTET-STREAM; exec open %s
Application/PDF; /Users/mankoff/bin/pine_attach %s
Image/JPEG; /Users/mankoff/bin/pine_attach %s
Image/PNG; /Users/mankoff/bin/pine_attach %s
Image/GIF; /Users/mankoff/bin/pine_attach %s

The first two open excel and word documents. The
remainder all use the Preview application, which also
needs valid file extensions. So the pine_attach shell
script sets this up properly. It is simply this:


#!/bin/bash
file=`echo $1 | cut -d"/" -f4`
type=`file -bi $1 | cut -d"/" -f2`
echo $0 $1 $2 $3 $file $type >>
~/tmp/pine.attach/debug
cp $1 /Users/mankoff/tmp/pine.attach/$file.$type
open /Users/mankoff/tmp/pine.attach/$file.$type

It copies the tmp file to the tmp/pine.attach
directory with a valid extension, then calls "Open" on
that file, which launches Preview or some other
application.

My script might work for the Excel and Word files, but
I figured if I can have them handled in a more direct
(correct?) manner I would do that.

Side effects:

the /var/tmp/ directory fills up because when Word or
Excel finally quits, pine does not delete the file.
The pine.attach directory also fills up with tmp
files. Not a big deal...

  -k.

EXCLUSIVELY ON CD-ROM

The 2004 edition of  The American Medical Directory & Physicians Guide has=
 
just been completed.
  
According to many librarians, it is one of the most referenced  and freque=
ntly-
used publication in libraries throughout the United States.
 
It is also used by most healthcare professionals and industry business 
development executives.

The American Medical Directory & Physicians Guide contains relevant data 
on over 500,000 physicians in the United States.
 
Each record is indexed by such features as name, address, phone/fax, count=
y, 
year licensed, type of practice, type of physician, as well as primary and=
 
secondary specialty.

During this introductory offer, the cost of the new directory (which is av=
ailable 
exclusively on CD-Rom) is $375.00 (reg. $795).   

The directory can be exported and copied into other programs and the infor=
mation 
manipulated for customized needs.
  
It is also offered on an unlimited use basis.

Market Mover Stock Report's Last Pick (CWTD) exploded from $1.19 to 
$9.20, a gain of over 670% in 5 days (Feb 12 - 17)!!!

Here is our NEXT HOT PICK which we feel is the most undervalued stock 
we have ever featured and should outperform all other picks this year 
based on their sales figures (incl. a backlog of over $100 Million), 
incredibly solid numbers, and low outstanding share total.

Life Energy and Technology Holdings, Inc.
(OTCBB: LETH)
Current Price: 1.85
Near-Term Target: 7.00
Projected High for '04: 15.00

We are sending this URGENT INVESTOR BULLETIN REVEALING THE MOST 
UNDERVALUED STOCK ON THE OTCBB to our millions of subscribers for substant=
ial 
profits immediately! 
Sales orders received by LETH exceed $150 Million over the past year 
while major news was just released that adds multi-millions to the bottom =

line. LETH has experienced a recent spike in price and volume 
indicating heavy accumulation of shares which is a sign of even bigger thi=
ngs to 
come for this emerging world leader in the conversion of waste 
materials into electrical energy, an industry with such high global demand=
 that 
it is impossible to assign a value to the size of the market.

Solving a Dual Crisis - Waste and Energy:

LETH is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their Biosphere 
Process System to generate revenue from the disposal of a wide variety 
of waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour which makes a major impact on 
the global waste problem. This profitable and environmentally safe 
process converts into clean, "green" electricity such waste materials as 
Municipal Solid Waste, agricultural wastes, forestry wastes, medical 
wastes, industrial wastes, sewage sludge, shale oil, sour natural gas, and=
 
the huge market of used tires. LETH profits from the sale of 
electricity created from the waste conversion on a continuous basis by gen=
erating 
5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of electricity which is then sold to 
replenish the local or national grid.

(Mar 3 '04) LETH Releases Major Product Delivery and Net Profit News

LETH delivered 12 Biosphere Process Systems which resulted in a net 
profit of $3.5 Million, the equivalent of .12 cents per share. LETH is 
scheduled to receive an additional $7 Million translating into an 
additional .24 cents per share which is the balance of this completed cont=
ract 
over the next 6 months. The net profit per share from just this single 
contract would value the stock above $6 by calculating the .36 cents 
per share total at an average industry PE of 18 - 22. 

Examining LETH - By The Numbers:

Total Assets: 36.8 Million =3D 1.26 per share of assets
Cash: 23.4 Million =3D .80 cents per share of cash
Shares Outstanding: 29 million (down from 31.8 million) after 2.8 
million shares retired in Feb. '04
Additional Shares to be Retired: 1.3 million per Company press release
Estimated Shares in Float: 7 million
Completed Biosphere Process Systems Now in Operation: 26

Record Backlog of Sales for LETH:

During the past year, over 20 additional Biosphere Process Systems have 
been ordered, which upon completion represents a backlog exceeding over 
$100 Million in upcoming sales. Many of these contractual agreements 
include options for the purchase of additional Biosphere Systems in the 
future once the initial order has been completed. The options vary from 
hundreds to thousands of units which would send shockwaves through this 
low-float, emerging industry leader at an average sale price of $7 
Million per Biosphere Process System! 

LETH's Blue Chip Partner - Fortifying the System:

LETH is an alliance partner with Tetra Tech, Inc. (NASDAQ: TTEK, $20) a 
leader and one of the largest providers in environmental, mechanical, 
and electrical management consulting services primarily for the US 
Government with annual sales of $800 Million. Tetra Tech will coordinate t=
he 
securing of necessary permits, installation, and continuous worldwide 
monitoring of the Biosphere Process System for LETH. Tetra Tech is now 
in the process of obtaining Department of Environmental Quality 
permitting for the Biosphere Process in the state of Louisiana. This is a =

monumental event for LETH which opens the floodgates for major project 
revenues in Louisiana while having a parallel effect on LETH stock in the =

form of a huge near-term announcement.

Stock Set to Explode on Earnings Boom:

LETH has the impressive financials and sales already in the pipeline to 
achieve record-setting stock price levels in support of the Company's 
breakout year. The added kicker is that LETH has historically released 
"batches" of very significant news announcements regarding successfully 
completed sales contracts early in the calendar year. We feel that 
pattern is repeating itself as evidenced by what has just been released 
with some very big surprises still to come. There aren't any companies at =

any price level with the technology or exponential sales growth to 
match LETH, while simultaneously containing all the ingredients for major =

profits as global demand to solve two crises areas, waste and electrical 
energy, reaches unprecedented levels. 

Required Market Mover Stock Report (MMSR) Information: MMSR cautions 
that small and micro-cap stocks are high-risk investments and that some 
or all investment dollars can be lost. We suggest you consult a 
professional investment advisor before purchasing any stock. All opinions =

expressed on the featured company are the opinions of MMSR. MMSR recommend=
s 
you use the information found here as an initial starting point for 
conducting your own research and your own due diligence on the featured 
company in order to determine your own personal opinion of the company 
before investing. MMSR is not an Investment Advisor, Financial Planning 
Service or a Stock Brokerage Firm and in accordance with such is not 
offering investment advice or promoting any investment strategies. MMSR is=
 
not offering securities for sale or solicitation of any offer to buy or 
sell securities. MMSR has received twelve thousand dollars from an 
unaffiliated third party for the preparation of this company profile. Sinc=
e 
we have received compensation there is an inherent conflict of interest 
in our statements and opinions. Readers of this publication are 
cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements, which=
 are 
based on certain assumptions and expectations involving various risks 
and uncertainties, that could cause results to differ materially from 
those set forth in the forward looking statements.

It seems that pine has a problem decoding base 64 encoding subjects every
now and then, and the common factor to me seems to be the length of the
subject field.  The result is that the subject field is not decoded at all.

Is this a known problem?  If not, I can provide examples :)

I'm using pine 4.58 on Linux.

	This is indeed a problem but not pine's problem, at least for my 
research on the matter.	

	This is an RFC2047 (or the obsoleted RFC1522) violation while 
encoding the Subject, the size of the encoded Subject is over 75 chars 
(see bellow).

Quoting RFC2047:
| 2. Syntax of encoded-words
| (...)
| encoded-word = "=?" charset "?" encoding "?" encoded-text "?="
| (...)
| An 'encoded-word' may not be more than 75 characters long, including
| 'charset', 'encoding', 'encoded-text', and delimiters. If it is
| desirable to encode more text than will fit in an 'encoded-word' of
| 75 characters, multiple 'encoded-word's (separated by CRLF SPACE) may
| be used.
|
| While there is no limit to the length of a multiple-line header
| field, each line of a header field that contains one or more
| 'encoded-word's is limited to 76 characters.
|
| The length restrictions are included both to ease interoperability
| through internetwork mail gateways, and to impose a limit on the
| amount of lookahead a header parser must employ (while looking for a
| final ?= delimiter) before it can decide whether a token is an
| "encoded-word" or something else.

	Pine is RFC2047 strict and does not decode an invalid 
encoded-word.

	If this is not the case then you may have found a bug...

Market Mover Stock Report's Last Pick (CWTD) exploded from $1.19 to 
$9.20, a gain of over 670% in 5 days (Feb 12 - 17)!!!

Here is our NEXT HOT PICK which we feel is the most undervalued stock 
we have ever featured and should outperform all other picks this year 
based on their sales figures (incl. a backlog of over $100 Million), 
incredibly solid numbers, and low outstanding share total.

Life Energy and Technology Holdings, Inc.
(OTCBB: LETH)
Current Price: 2.40
Near-Term Target: 7.00
Projected High for '04: 15.00

We are sending this URGENT INVESTOR BULLETIN REVEALING THE MOST 
UNDERVALUED STOCK ON THE OTCBB to our millions of subscribers for substant=
ial 
profits immediately! 
Sales orders received by LETH exceed $150 Million over the past year 
while major news was just released that adds multi-millions to the bottom =

line. LETH has experienced a recent spike in price and volume 
indicating heavy accumulation of shares which is a sign of even bigger thi=
ngs to 
come for this emerging world leader in the conversion of waste 
materials into electrical energy, an industry with such high global demand=
 that 
it is impossible to assign a value to the size of the market.

Solving a Dual Crisis - Waste and Energy:

LETH is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their Biosphere 
Process System to generate revenue from the disposal of a wide variety 
of waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour which makes a major impact on 
the global waste problem. This profitable and environmentally safe 
process converts into clean, "green" electricity such waste materials as 
Municipal Solid Waste, agricultural wastes, forestry wastes, medical 
wastes, industrial wastes, sewage sludge, shale oil, sour natural gas, and=
 
the huge market of used tires. LETH profits from the sale of 
electricity created from the waste conversion on a continuous basis by gen=
erating 
5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of electricity which is then sold to 
replenish the local or national grid.

(Mar 3 '04) LETH Releases Major Product Delivery and Net Profit News

LETH delivered 12 Biosphere Process Systems which resulted in a net 
profit of $3.5 Million, the equivalent of .12 cents per share. LETH is 
scheduled to receive an additional $7 Million translating into an 
additional .24 cents per share which is the balance of this completed cont=
ract 
over the next 6 months. The net profit per share from just this single 
contract would value the stock above $6 by calculating the .36 cents 
per share total at an average industry PE of 18 - 22. 

Examining LETH - By The Numbers:

Total Assets: 36.8 Million =3D 1.26 per share of assets
Cash: 23.4 Million =3D .80 cents per share of cash
Shares Outstanding: 29 million (down from 31.8 million) after 2.8 
million shares retired in Feb. '04
Additional Shares to be Retired: 1.3 million per Company press release
Estimated Shares in Float: 7 million
Completed Biosphere Process Systems Now in Operation: 26

Record Backlog of Sales for LETH:

During the past year, over 20 additional Biosphere Process Systems have 
been ordered, which upon completion represents a backlog exceeding over 
$100 Million in upcoming sales. Many of these contractual agreements 
include options for the purchase of additional Biosphere Systems in the 
future once the initial order has been completed. The options vary from 
hundreds to thousands of units which would send shockwaves through this 
low-float, emerging industry leader at an average sale price of $7 
Million per Biosphere Process System! 

LETH's Blue Chip Partner - Fortifying the System:

LETH is an alliance partner with Tetra Tech, Inc. (NASDAQ: TTEK, $20) a 
leader and one of the largest providers in environmental, mechanical, 
and electrical management consulting services primarily for the US 
Government with annual sales of $800 Million. Tetra Tech will coordinate t=
he 
securing of necessary permits, installation, and continuous worldwide 
monitoring of the Biosphere Process System for LETH. Tetra Tech is now 
in the process of obtaining Department of Environmental Quality 
permitting for the Biosphere Process in the state of Louisiana. This is a =

monumental event for LETH which opens the floodgates for major project 
revenues in Louisiana while having a parallel effect on LETH stock in the =

form of a huge near-term announcement.

Stock Set to Explode on Earnings Boom:

LETH has the impressive financials and sales already in the pipeline to 
achieve record-setting stock price levels in support of the Company's 
breakout year. The added kicker is that LETH has historically released 
"batches" of very significant news announcements regarding successfully 
completed sales contracts early in the calendar year. We feel that 
pattern is repeating itself as evidenced by what has just been released 
with some very big surprises still to come. There aren't any companies at =

any price level with the technology or exponential sales growth to 
match LETH, while simultaneously containing all the ingredients for major =

profits as global demand to solve two crises areas, waste and electrical 
energy, reaches unprecedented levels.

Greetings,

Any future plans to include native Maildir support in Pine
as Mutt does? Yes, I know this can be added via various IMAP
implementations, but that's an unnecessary layer of complexity.

I've already had one ISP I know drop PINE completely in favor
of Mutt because of this. More and more ISPs that still allow
shell accounts are moving to Maildir format as standard.

Not more strict than when I tell pine to mark messages based on content of
subject, it does indeed also pick those with bogus encoding :)

Well, you seem to be correct, allthough the above behaviour is perhaps
strange.  (pine being able to "read" the bogus encoded subject when it does
search, allthough not being able to display them in index list or when
viewing message)

Hi all,

I just try to find a way to "unlock" my INBOX file when the new messages
will arrive and they will be filtered by Pine filters. I'm just not
sure if I expressed this correctly, but I wonder why my inbox checker
("wmbiff") can't show the correct number of e-mails (set in the Pine
as INBOX) when Pine already moved these e-mails from INBOX to some
other folders? The INBOX file is empty, but as long Pine stays open as
long "wmbiff" (other mailbox checkers as well) show that there are
e-mails in the INBOX. But as soon as Pine exits the correct state is
updated. For me it looks like Pine holds the INBOX file status and
update it on the program exit.

Is there a way to set Pine to allow the INBOX file to be updated
without a necessity to quit Pine and run it again?

Regards,
Murphy

Market Mover Stock Report's Last Pick (CWTD) exploded from $1.19 to
$9.20, a gain of over 670% in 5 days (Feb 12 - 17)!!!

Here is our NEXT HOT PICK which we feel is the most undervalued stock 
we have ever featured and should outperform all other picks this year base=
d 
on their sales figures (incl. a backlog of over $100 Million), incredibly =
solid 
numbers, and low outstanding share total.

Life Energy and Technology Holdings, Inc.
(OTCBB: LETH)
Current Price: 2.25
Near-Term Target: 7.00
Projected High for '04: 15.00

We are sending this URGENT INVESTOR BULLETIN REVEALING THE 
MOST UNDERVALUED STOCK ON THE OTCBB to our millions of 
subscribers for substantial profits immediately!
Sales orders received by LETH exceed $150 Million over the past year 
while major news was just released that adds multi-millions to the bottom =

line. LETH has experienced a recent spike in price and volume indicating 
heavy accumulation of shares which is a sign of even bigger things to come=
 
for this emerging world leader in the conversion of waste materials into 
electrical energy, an industry with such high global demand that it is 
impossible to assign a value to the size of the market.

(Mar 9 '04) Urgent News Update:
LETH Announces the Sale of Two (2) Biosphere Process Systems to 
Procura International Limited for $14 Million with an Option for the Sale =
of 
an Additional 98 Systems Over the Next 24 Months.

Solving a Dual Crisis - Waste and Energy:

LETH is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their Biosphere 
Process System to generate revenue from the disposal of a wide variety of =

waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour which makes a major impact on the 
global waste problem. This profitable and environmentally safe process 
converts into clean, "green" electricity such waste materials as Municipal=
 
Solid Waste, agricultural wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes, industr=
ial 
wastes, sewage sludge, shale oil, sour natural gas, and the huge market of=
 
used tires. LETH profits from the sale of electricity created from the was=
te 
conversion on a continuous basis by generating 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour=
 
of electricity which is then sold to replenish the local or national grid.=


(Mar 3 '04) LETH Release Major Product Delivery and Net Profit News
LETH delivered 12 Biosphere Process Systems which resulted in a net profit=
 
of $3.5 Million, the equivalent of .12 cents per share. LETH is scheduled =
to 
receive an additional $7 Million translating into an additional .24 cents =
per 
share which is the balance of this completed contract over the next 6 mont=
hs. 
The net profit per share from just this single contract would value the st=
ock 
above $6 by calculating the .36 cents per share total at an average indust=
ry 
PE of 18 - 22.

Examining LETH - By The Numbers

Total Assets: 36.8 Million =3D 1.26 per share of assets
Cash: 23.4 Million =3D .80 cents per share of cash
Shares Outstanding: 29 million (down from 31.8 million) after 2.8 million =

shares retired in Feb. '04
Additional Shares to be Retired: 1.3 million per Company press release
Estimated Shares in Float: 7 million
Completed Biosphere Process Systems Now in Operation: 26

Record Backlog of Sales for LETH:

During the past year, over 20 additional Biosphere Process Systems have 
been ordered, which upon completion represents a backlog exceeding over 
$100 Million in upcoming sales. Many of these contractual agreements 
include options for the purchase of additional Biosphere Systems in the 
future once the initial order has been completed. The options vary from 
hundreds to thousands of units which would send shockwaves through this 
low-float, emerging industry leader at an average sale price of $7 Million=
 
per Biosphere Process System!

LETH is an alliance partner with Tetra Tech, Inc. (NASDAQ: TTEK, $20) a 
leader and one of the largest providers in environmental, mechanical, and =

electrical management consulting services primarily for the US Government =

with annual sales of $800 Million. Tetra Tech will coordinate the securing=
 of 
necessary permits, installation, and continuous worldwide monitoring of th=
e 
Biosphere Process System for LETH. Tetra Tech is now in the process of 
obtaining Department of Environmental Quality permitting for the 
Biosphere Process in the state of Louisiana. This is a monumental event fo=
r 
LETH which opens the floodgates for major project revenues in Louisiana 
while having a parallel effect on LETH stock in the form of a huge near-
term announcement.

Stock Set to Explode on Earnings Boom:

LETH has the impressive financials and sales already in the pipeline to 
achieve record-setting stock price levels in support of the Company's 
breakout year. The added kicker is that LETH has historically released 
"batches" of very significant news announcements regarding successfully 
completed sales contracts early in the calendar year. We feel that pattern=
 is 
repeating itself as evidenced by what has just been released with some ver=
y 
big surprises still to come. There aren't any companies at any price level=
 
with the technology or exponential sales growth to match LETH, while 
simultaneously containing all the ingredients for major profits as global =

demand to solve two crisis areas, waste and electrical energy, reaches 
unprecedented levels.

I can confirm it! This also happens to me.

IMHO this is a misbehavior since it ruins strictness coherency. I call 
pine developers' attention for this point.

A maybe not fully matching example are encoded attachment file names.

Some programs encode some parts of them while it apparently was not
written in the RFC and lately, newer versions of pine started to
decode them also even if it wasn't required by the RFC(or maybe
even forbidden, don't know...).

I wouldn't want to promote to use longer encoded words, but OTOH, it does
not seem to have fatal consequencies to be able to read them.

There is a patch to relax the length check(allow double lengh) at decoding in:

It's originally from Jungshik Shin, looks plausible to me so far.

I didn't carefully re-verify it now, but: "go figure" :-)

Thanks, I generated a new smaller patch from those chunks and put them
into my own pine ebuild script (using gentoo), and it works nicely :)

Market Mover Stock Report's Last Pick (CWTD) exploded from $1.19 to
$9.20, a gain of over 670% in 5 days (Feb 12 - 17)!!!

Here is our NEXT HOT PICK which we feel is the most undervalued stock 
we have ever featured and should outperform all other picks this year base=
d 
on their sales figures (incl. a backlog of over $100 Million), incredibly =
solid 
numbers, and low outstanding share total.

Life Energy and Technology Holdings, Inc.
(OTCBB: LETH)
Current Price: 2.25
Near-Term Target: 7.00
Projected High for '04: 15.00

We are sending this URGENT INVESTOR BULLETIN REVEALING THE 
MOST UNDERVALUED STOCK ON THE OTCBB to our millions of 
subscribers for substantial profits immediately!
Sales orders received by LETH exceed $150 Million over the past year 
while major news was just released that adds multi-millions to the bottom =

line. LETH has experienced a recent spike in price and volume indicating 
heavy accumulation of shares which is a sign of even bigger things to come=
 
for this emerging world leader in the conversion of waste materials into 
electrical energy, an industry with such high global demand that it is 
impossible to assign a value to the size of the market.

(Mar 9 '04) Urgent News Update:
LETH Announces the Sale of Two (2) Biosphere Process Systems to 
Procura International Limited for $14 Million with an Option for the Sale =
of 
an Additional 98 Systems Over the Next 24 Months.

Solving a Dual Crisis - Waste and Energy:

LETH is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their Biosphere 
Process System to generate revenue from the disposal of a wide variety of =

waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour which makes a major impact on the 
global waste problem. This profitable and environmentally safe process 
converts into clean, "green" electricity such waste materials as Municipal=
 
Solid Waste, agricultural wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes, industr=
ial 
wastes, sewage sludge, shale oil, sour natural gas, and the huge market of=
 
used tires. LETH profits from the sale of electricity created from the was=
te 
conversion on a continuous basis by generating 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour=
 
of electricity which is then sold to replenish the local or national grid.=


(Mar 3 '04) LETH Release Major Product Delivery and Net Profit News
LETH delivered 12 Biosphere Process Systems which resulted in a net profit=
 
of $3.5 Million, the equivalent of .12 cents per share. LETH is scheduled =
to 
receive an additional $7 Million translating into an additional .24 cents =
per 
share which is the balance of this completed contract over the next 6 mont=
hs. 
The net profit per share from just this single contract would value the st=
ock 
above $6 by calculating the .36 cents per share total at an average indust=
ry 
PE of 18 - 22.

Examining LETH - By The Numbers

Total Assets: 36.8 Million =3D 1.26 per share of assets
Cash: 23.4 Million =3D .80 cents per share of cash
Shares Outstanding: 29 million (down from 31.8 million) after 2.8 million =

shares retired in Feb. '04
Additional Shares to be Retired: 1.3 million per Company press release
Estimated Shares in Float: 7 million
Completed Biosphere Process Systems Now in Operation: 26

Record Backlog of Sales for LETH:

During the past year, over 20 additional Biosphere Process Systems have 
been ordered, which upon completion represents a backlog exceeding over 
$100 Million in upcoming sales. Many of these contractual agreements 
include options for the purchase of additional Biosphere Systems in the 
future once the initial order has been completed. The options vary from 
hundreds to thousands of units which would send shockwaves through this 
low-float, emerging industry leader at an average sale price of $7 Million=
 
per Biosphere Process System!

LETH's Blue Chip Partner - Fortifying the System:

LETH is an alliance partner with Tetra Tech, Inc. (NASDAQ: TTEK, $20) a 
leader and one of the largest providers in environmental, mechanical, and =

electrical management consulting services primarily for the US Government =

with annual sales of $800 Million. Tetra Tech will coordinate the securing=
 of 
necessary permits, installation, and continuous worldwide monitoring of th=
e 
Biosphere Process System for LETH. Tetra Tech is now in the process of 
obtaining Department of Environmental Quality permitting for the 
Biosphere Process in the state of Louisiana. This is a monumental event fo=
r 
LETH which opens the floodgates for major project revenues in Louisiana 
while having a parallel effect on LETH stock in the form of a huge near-
term announcement.

Stock Set to Explode on Earnings Boom:

LETH has the impressive financials and sales already in the pipeline to 
achieve record-setting stock price levels in support of the Company's 
breakout year. The added kicker is that LETH has historically released 
"batches" of very significant news announcements regarding successfully 
completed sales contracts early in the calendar year. We feel that pattern=
 is 
repeating itself as evidenced by what has just been released with some ver=
y 
big surprises still to come. There aren't any companies at any price level=
 
with the technology or exponential sales growth to match LETH, while 
simultaneously containing all the ingredients for major profits as global =

demand to solve two crisis areas, waste and electrical energy, reaches 
unprecedented levels.

Market Mover Stock Report's Last Pick (CWTD) exploded from $1.19 to
$9.20, a gain of over 670% in 5 days (Feb 12 - 17)!!!

Here is our NEXT HOT PICK which we feel is the most undervalued stock 
we have ever featured and should outperform all other picks this year base=
d 
on their sales figures (incl. a backlog of over $100 Million), incredibly =
solid 
numbers, and low outstanding share total.

Life Energy and Technology Holdings, Inc.
(OTCBB: LETH)
Current Price: 2.45
Near-Term Target: 7.00
Projected High for '04: 15.00

We are sending this URGENT INVESTOR BULLETIN REVEALING THE 
MOST UNDERVALUED STOCK ON THE OTCBB to our millions of 
subscribers for substantial profits immediately!
Sales orders received by LETH exceed $150 Million over the past year 
while major news was just released that adds multi-millions to the bottom =

line. LETH has experienced a recent spike in price and volume indicating 
heavy accumulation of shares which is a sign of even bigger things to come=
 
for this emerging world leader in the conversion of waste materials into 
electrical energy, an industry with such high global demand that it is 
impossible to assign a value to the size of the market.

(Mar 9 '04) Urgent News Update:
LETH Announces the Sale of Two (2) Biosphere Process Systems to 
Procura International Limited for $14 Million with an Option for the Sale =
of 
an Additional 98 Systems Over the Next 24 Months.

Solving a Dual Crisis - Waste and Energy:

LETH is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their Biosphere 
Process System to generate revenue from the disposal of a wide variety of =

waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour which makes a major impact on the 
global waste problem. This profitable and environmentally safe process 
converts into clean, "green" electricity such waste materials as Municipal=
 
Solid Waste, agricultural wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes, industr=
ial 
wastes, sewage sludge, shale oil, sour natural gas, and the huge market of=
 
used tires. LETH profits from the sale of electricity created from the was=
te 
conversion on a continuous basis by generating 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour=
 
of electricity which is then sold to replenish the local or national grid.=


(Mar 3 '04) LETH Release Major Product Delivery and Net Profit News
LETH delivered 12 Biosphere Process Systems which resulted in a net profit=
 
of $3.5 Million, the equivalent of .12 cents per share. LETH is scheduled =
to 
receive an additional $7 Million translating into an additional .24 cents =
per 
share which is the balance of this completed contract over the next 6 mont=
hs. 
The net profit per share from just this single contract would value the st=
ock 
above $6 by calculating the .36 cents per share total at an average indust=
ry 
PE of 18 - 22.

Examining LETH - By The Numbers

Total Assets: 36.8 Million =3D 1.26 per share of assets
Cash: 23.4 Million =3D .80 cents per share of cash
Shares Outstanding: 29 million (down from 31.8 million) after 2.8 million =

shares retired in Feb. '04
Additional Shares to be Retired: 1.3 million per Company press release
Estimated Shares in Float: 7 million
Completed Biosphere Process Systems Now in Operation: 26

Record Backlog of Sales for LETH:

During the past year, over 20 additional Biosphere Process Systems have 
been ordered, which upon completion represents a backlog exceeding over 
$100 Million in upcoming sales. Many of these contractual agreements 
include options for the purchase of additional Biosphere Systems in the 
future once the initial order has been completed. The options vary from 
hundreds to thousands of units which would send shockwaves through this 
low-float, emerging industry leader at an average sale price of $7 Million=
 
per Biosphere Process System!

LETH's Blue Chip Partner - Fortifying the System:

LETH is an alliance partner with Tetra Tech, Inc. (NASDAQ: TTEK, $20) a 
leader and one of the largest providers in environmental, mechanical, and =

electrical management consulting services primarily for the US Government =

with annual sales of $800 Million. Tetra Tech will coordinate the securing=
 of 
necessary permits, installation, and continuous worldwide monitoring of th=
e 
Biosphere Process System for LETH. Tetra Tech is now in the process of 
obtaining Department of Environmental Quality permitting for the 
Biosphere Process in the state of Louisiana. This is a monumental event fo=
r 
LETH which opens the floodgates for major project revenues in Louisiana 
while having a parallel effect on LETH stock in the form of a huge near-
term announcement.

Stock Set to Explode on Earnings Boom:

LETH has the impressive financials and sales already in the pipeline to 
achieve record-setting stock price levels in support of the Company's 
breakout year. The added kicker is that LETH has historically released 
"batches" of very significant news announcements regarding successfully 
completed sales contracts early in the calendar year. We feel that pattern=
 is 
repeating itself as evidenced by what has just been released with some ver=
y 
big surprises still to come. There aren't any companies at any price level=
 
with the technology or exponential sales growth to match LETH, while 
simultaneously containing all the ingredients for major profits as global =

demand to solve two crisis areas, waste and electrical energy, reaches 
unprecedented levels.

Hi Guys,

I was hoping to get some help in regards to this rather unusual problem
i'm having with pine.  I am currently building from a debian package
downloaded from (http://src.braincells.com/debian).  I have since added
the following patches in:

  pine-maildir-patch:
	http://hico.fphil.uniba.sk/pine-patches.html

  Fix a bug when adding a pop3 incoming folder:
	http://www.math.washington.edu/~chappa/pine/info/halfopen.html

Now...the problem is...when i just had the first patch installed, i
couldn't access POP3 servers when trying to open a folder like:

  {my.mail.server/pop3}

With the second patch installed, I can access the mail servers, but i
can't save messages between my maildirs.  I can't think what it could
be...and it doesn't seem to matter which order I install the patches in!

Can anyone provide any insight/suggestions?

Thanks in advance.

Investor Financial Times Report

Specializing in Undervalued Small Cap Stocks for Immediate Breakout

We have the #1 track record for our most recent recommendations in 2004:

DLGI at .27	 	Currently .88	High 1.69 UP 526%
SWYC at .18	Currently 1.38	High 1.98 UP 1000%
FPDI at .21		Currently 1.08	High 1.25 UP 495%
VDWB at .18 	Currently 1.40	High 2.04 UP 1033%

Immediate Investor Recommendation
Our Hottest Sales and Earnings Play (and potential takeover target) 
Projected to Triple in 7 Days:

OrderPro Logistics, Inc. (OTCBB: OPLO)

Price--- .16
Sales '03--- over 2.3 million +2,700% growth over previous year
Est. Sales '04--- over 10 million 
Average PE--- Industry 22-25
7 day target--- .58
30 day target--- .92
Rating--- Extremely Undervalued

OPLO is a high-level provider of innovative management solutions for the 
transport and shipping industry for a blue-chip clientele, making them the=
 
hottest undervalued stock at this price level where shares are ready to 
explode on huge investor attention.

Sales have rocketed beyond all estimates for OPLO over the last 12 months =

with no signs of slowing. The numbers continue to stack-up as present sale=
s 
figures combined with current acquisition candidates, acquired and in 
process, total revenues of almost $40 million over the next 24 months. We =

are not the first to uncover this phenomenon as the stock is under 
accumulation, but we are acting aggressively on this recently filed data.

Major clients include Sears, Office Max, Union Pacific Railroad, 
NordicTrack, Pacer Global (the logistics company for Ford and General 
Motors), along with many other large and mid-level corporate giants lookin=
g 
to benefit from the Company's expertise in transportation and supply chain=
 
management, freight brokerage services, packaging assessment, and private =

fleet management.

OPLO can be considered a potential candidate to be acquired as their growt=
h 
and suite of services matches up identically to many companies acquired by=
 
UPS and FedEx over the past few years. We are expecting many significant 
upcoming press releases regarding record-breaking revenues and the 
completion of extremely profitable acquisitions.

OPLO is gaining in all the right categories with perhaps the one that matt=
ers 
most being the rapidly increasing attention from analysts, brokers, and 
aggressive investors with an eye for value and growth. OPLO has all the 
ingredients for major profits which is why we are seeing gains of 400=
% or 
more for early investors. This stock recommendation carries our highest 
rating for short-term trading profits.

Market News Alerts - Stock Pick of the Year
Life Energy and Technology Holdings, Inc.
(OTCBB: LETH)

LETH has been burning up the charts over the last 3 weeks and is looking 
more and more like one of those rare situations where the value of the 
Company is forcing its way into the stock price. We are seeing continuous =

big-block buying from investors on a worldwide scope with average daily 
trading volume up 10-fold (1,000%) over this recent period. 

While investors around the globe have LETH on their radar, they are also 
seeing the Company achieve record-breaking numbers with regard to sales, 
profits, and delivery of their Biosphere Process System in more countries =

than ever before. 

LETH Financial Summary:
Current Price: 2.50
Sales Orders Received '03: over $100 Million +300% growth vs. '02
Estimated Sales Orders '04: over $180 Million
Total Assets: $36.8 Million ($1.26 per share of assets)
Cash: $23.4 Million ($ .80 per share of cash)
Shares Outstanding: 29 million (down from 31.8 million) after 2.8 million =

shares retired in Feb. '04
Additional Shares to be Retired: 1.3 million per Company press release
Estimated Shares in Float: 7 million
Completed Biosphere Process Systems Now in Operation: 26
60-Day Price Target: 7.00 - 8.00
6-Month Price Target: 12.00 - 15.00 

The Biosphere Process System - Soaring Worldwide Demand:

LETH is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their Biosphere 
Process System to generate revenue from the disposal of a wide variety of =

waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour which makes a major impact on the 
global waste problem. This profitable and environmentally safe process 
converts into clean, "green" electricity such waste materials as Municipal=
 
Solid Waste, agricultural wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes, industr=
ial 
wastes, sewage sludge, shale oil, sour natural gas, and the huge market of=
 
used tires. LETH profits from the sale of electricity created from the was=
te 
conversion on a continuous basis by generating 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour=
 
of electricity which is then sold to replenish the local or national grid.=


The Biosphere Process succeeds in filling an urgent worldwide need for 
cost-effective renewable energy sources and a corresponding universal need=
 
to solve critical problems in the disposal of waste. LETH has secured 
worldwide acceptance for a revolutionary product designed to significantly=
 
impact the global waste problem while a major push for generating 
electricity from alternative sources continues to be the hot topic due to =

shortages and massive power failures.

Record Backlog of Sales for LETH:

During the past year, over 20 Biosphere Process Systems have been ordered,=
 
which upon completion represents a backlog exceeding over $100 Million in =

upcoming sales. Many of these contractual agreements include options for 
the purchase of additional Biosphere Systems in the future once the initia=
l 
order has been completed. The options vary from hundreds to thousands of 
units per contract which would send shockwaves through this low-float, 
emerging industry leader at an average sale price of $7 Million per 
Biosphere Process System!

Major Headlines and Highlights:
March 11, '04 - LETH retains Murdock Capital Partners, a 12 year-old, New =

York-based Corporate Communications firm to manage the Company's 
Investor Relations Program. LETH President and CEO, Dr. Chris 
McCormack, stated that a program which effectively communicates with 
investors is of significant value as LETH will be establishing a major US =

presence with the upcoming installation of the first Biosphere Process 
System at the Port of New Orleans early in the second quarter of 2004.

March 9, '04 - LETH Announces the Sale of Two (2) Biosphere Process 
Systems to Procura International Limited for $14 Million with an Option fo=
r 
the Sale of an Additional 98 Systems Over the Next 24 Months.

March 3, '04 - LETH Releases Major Product Delivery and Net Profit News
LETH delivered 12 Biosphere Process Systems which resulted in a net profit=
 
of $3.5 Million, the equivalent of .12 cents per share. LETH is scheduled =
to 
receive an additional $7 Million translating into an additional .24 cents =
per 
share which is the balance of this completed contract over the next 6 mont=
hs. 
The net profit per share from just this single contract would value the st=
ock 
above $6 by calculating the .36 cents per share total at an average indust=
ry 
PE of 18 - 22.

Feb. 27, '04 - LETH Enters Agreement to bring Biosphere Process System 
into Russia's Third Largest City for Waste Recycling and Conversion into 
Energy Production.

Feb. 13, '04: LETH Reports the Retirement of 2.8 Million Shares and 
Intends to Retire an Additional 1.3 Million for a Total of 4.1 Million.

Jan. 23, '04: LETH 10Q Reports Assets at $36.8 Million vs. $16.8 Million; =

Cash at $23.4 Million vs. Deficit.

LETH's Blue Chip Partner - Fortifying the System:

LETH is an alliance partner with Tetra Tech, Inc. (NASDAQ: TTEK, $20) a 
leader and one of the largest providers in environmental, mechanical, and =

electrical management consulting services primarily for the US Government =

with annual sales of $800 Million. Tetra Tech will coordinate the securing=
 of 
necessary permits, installation, and continuous worldwide monitoring of th=
e 
Biosphere Process System for LETH. Tetra Tech is now in the process of 
obtaining Department of Environmental Quality permitting for the 
Biosphere Process in the state of Louisiana. This is a monumental event fo=
r 
LETH which opens the floodgates for major project revenues in Louisiana 
while having a parallel effect on LETH stock in the form of a huge near-
term announcement.

Political Power Fosters Rapid Global Expansion:

LETH has captured the profit-making attention of both US and international=
 
investors by embracing a major foothold on the global waste problem as 
well as the urgent need to generate electricity from alternative sources. =
This 
has been accomplished by successfully creating major inroads to all corner=
s 
of the globe through the political contacts at the highest level from Dr. =

Albert Reynolds, Chairman of LETH, who is also the former Prime Minister 
of Ireland. Dr. Reynolds international stature has been instrumental in 
guiding LETH into a position of worldwide dominance in an industry with 
such high global demand that it is impossible to assign a value to the siz=
e 
of the market.

Uncommon Value for a Company of this Caliber:

We are witnessing a breakout year in the making judging by the frequency 
of recently announced sales contracts for the Biosphere, the impressive 
backlog of over $100 Million in sales orders, and the Company's very solid=
 
financial position. We view this perfectly timed convergence of events as =
the 
catalyst for additional contracts that will perpetuate the shattering of t=
he 
Company's own sal to =

place undue reliance on forward looking statements, which are based on 
certain assumptions and expectations involving various risks and 
uncertainties, that could cause results to differ materially from those se=
t forth 
in the forward looking statements.

Investor Financial Times Report

Specializing in Undervalued Small Cap Stocks for Immediate Breakout

We have the #1 track record for our most recent recommendations in 2004:

DLGI at .27	 	Currently .88	High 1.69 UP 526%
SWYC at .18	Currently 1.38	High 1.98 UP 1000%
FPDI at .21		Currently 1.08	High 1.25 UP 495%
VDWB at .18 	Currently 1.40	High 2.04 UP 1033%

Immediate Investor Recommendation
Our Hottest Sales and Earnings Play (and potential takeover target) 
Projected to Triple in 7 Days:

OrderPro Logistics, Inc. (OTCBB: OPLO)

Price--- .16
Sales '03--- over 2.3 million +2,700% growth over previous year
Est. Sales '04--- over 10 million 
Average PE--- Industry 22-25
7 day target--- .58
30 day target--- .92
Rating--- Extremely Undervalued

OPLO is a high-level provider of innovative management solutions for the 
transport and shipping industry for a blue-chip clientele, making them the=
 
hottest undervalued stock at this price level where shares are ready to 
explode on huge investor attention.

Sales have rocketed beyond all estimates for OPLO over the last 12 months =

with no signs of slowing. The numbers continue to stack-up as present sale=
s 
figures combined with current acquisition candidates, acquired and in 
process, total revenues of almost $40 million over the next 24 months. We =

are not the first to uncover this phenomenon as the stock is under 
accumulation, but we are acting aggressively on this recently filed data.

Major clients include Sears, Office Max, Union Pacific Railroad, 
NordicTrack, Pacer Global (the logistics company for Ford and General 
Motors), along with many other large and mid-level corporate giants lookin=
g 
to benefit from the Company's expertise in transportation and supply chain=
 
management, freight brokerage services, packaging assessment, and private =

fleet management.

OPLO can be considered a potential candidate to be acquired as their growt=
h 
and suite of services matches up identically to many companies acquired by=
 
UPS and FedEx over the past few years. We are expecting many significant 
upcoming press releases regarding record-breaking revenues and the 
completion of extremely profitable acquisitions.

OPLO is gaining in all the right categories with perhaps the one that matt=
ers 
most being the rapidly increasing attention from analysts, brokers, and 
aggressive investors with an eye for value and growth. OPLO has all the 
ingredients for major profits which is why we are seeing gains of 400=
% or 
more for early investors. This stock recommendation carries our highest 
rating for short-term trading profits.

of giving investors the necessary knowledge to make rational and profitabl=

I'm constantly trying to speed up Pine because I have a slow
dial-up connection but I like to run Pine on my local machine.
Today I did some random tweaks and things definitely seem to have
speeded up but I'm not sure which of my tweaks did it. I'm
thinking that it might be this:

 incoming-startup-rule            =
            Set    Rule Values
            ---  ----------------------
            ( )  first-unseen
            ( )  first-recent
            ( )  first-important
            ( )  first-important-or-unseen
            ( )  first-important-or-recent
            ( )  first
            (*)  last

I used to have it set to 'first-recent' and I was hoping that
changing it to last would speed things up because Pine doesn't
have to scan looking for the first RECENT message, but I have no
idea if my guess is correct. Does anyone know?

Also, if anyone has any other speed tips, let me know and I'll
add them here:

Thank you,

I tried to respond via to some of this (and ask some stuff about
the things on your website), but it just bounced back several hours later
with a 'reverse spam blocker'.

Actually that bounce-back was not a 'reverse spam blocker'
because I don't do that, and in general I'm against bounce backs,
as I discuss here:

 <http://www.ii.com/internet/robots/procmail/qs/#reject>

Instead, it was a problem at DreamHost, which seems to be fixed
now.

The answer to the question that you emailed me is in this section
of my Power Pine page:

 <http://www.ii.com/internet/messaging/pine/pc/#faveSettings>

i.e., expose-hidden-config is set in the Pine feature-list and it
is only available in Pine 4.40 and later.

Thank you,
Nancy

Hello Pine users!

I'm trying to send auto-answer to content of
*Disposition-Notification-To* header.

Have someone already done something like this?
What for rule can I use? (to make that full automatic!)
Extra question: what do you mean about that?

Best Regards!

Investor Financial Times Report

Specializing in Undervalued Small Cap Stocks for Immediate Breakout

We have the #1 track record for our most recent recommendations in 
2004:

DLGI at .27	Currently .88	High 1.69 UP 526%
SWYC at .18	Currently 1.38	High 1.98 UP 1000%
FPDI at .21	Currently 1.08	High 1.25 UP 495%
VDWB at .18 	Currently 1.40	High 2.04 UP 1033%

Immediate Investor Recommendation
Our Hottest Sales and Earnings Play (and potential takeover target)
Projected to Triple in 7 Days:

OrderPro Logistics, Inc. (OTCBB: OPLO)

Price--- .18

Sales '03--- over 2.3 million +2,700% growth over previous year
Est. Sales '04--- over 10 million
Average PE--- Industry 22-25
7 day target--- .58
30 day target--- .92
Rating--- Extremely Undervalued

OPLO is a high-level provider of innovative management solutions for 
the transport and shipping industry for a blue-chip clientele, making 
them the hottest undervalued stock at this price level where shares are 
ready to explode on huge investor attention.

Sales have rocketed beyond all estimates for OPLO over the last 12 
months with no signs of slowing. The numbers continue to stack-up as 
present sales figures combined with current acquisition candidates, 
acquired and in process, total revenues of almost $40 million over the 
next 24 months. We are not the first to uncover this phenomenon as the 
stock is under accumulation, but we are acting aggressively on this 
recently filed data.

Major clients include Sears, Office Max, Union Pacific Railroad,
NordicTrack, Pacer Global (the logistics company for Ford and General
Motors), along with many other large and mid-level corporate giants 
looking to benefit from the Company's expertise in transportation and 
supply chain management, freight brokerage services, packaging 
assessment, and private fleet management.

OPLO can be considered a potential candidate to be acquired as their 
growth and suite of services matches up identically to many companies 
acquired by UPS and FedEx over the past few years. We are expecting many 
significant upcoming press releases regarding record-breaking revenues 
and the completion of extremely profitable acquisitions.

OPLO is gaining in all the right categories with perhaps the one that 
matters most being the rapidly increasing attention from analysts, 
brokers, and aggressive investors with an eye for value and growth. OPLO 
has all the ingredients for major profits which is why we are seeing 
gains of 400% or more for early investors. This stock recommendation 
carries our highest rating for short-term trading profits.

         URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL
   (RE:  TRANSFER OF ($ 152,000.000.00 USD)
ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS

Dear sir,

We want to transfer to overseas ($ 152,000.000.00 USD)
One hundred and Fifty two million United States
Dollars) from  Co-operative 
Bank Of  Africa, I want to ask you to  quietly  look
for a reliable and honest person who will be
capable  and fit to provide either an existing bank
account  or  to set up a new  Bank a/c  immediately to
receive this money, even an empty a/c can serve to
receive this money, as long as you will remain honest
to me till the end for this important business
trusting in  you and believing  in God that you  will
never let me down either now or in future.

I am the Auditor General of
Co-operative Bank Of Africa , during the course of our
auditing  Idiscovered a floating fund  in an account
opened in the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has
operated
on this account again, after going through some old
files in the records I discovered that the owner of
the account  died without a [heir]  hence  the money
is floating and  if I do not remit this money out
urgently it will be forfeited for
nothing. the owner of this account is   Mr. Keith
Lathan Coulter , a foreigner, and an industrialist,
and  he
died,  since 1993. and  no other person knows about
this account or any thing concerning it, the account
has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved
to me as well that Mr. Keith Lathan Coulter   until
his death was the manager  Diamond Safari  [pty]. SA.

We will start the  first transfer with fifty two
million [$52,000.000] upon successful transaction
without any disappoint from your side, we shall
re-apply for the payment of the remaining  rest amount
to your account, The amount involved is (USD 152M) One
hundred and  Fifty two million United States Dollars,
only I want to first transfer $52,000.000 [fifty two
million United States Dollar from this money into a
safe foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I
don't know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as
a foreigner because this money can not be approved to
a local person here, without valid international
foreign passport, but can only be approved to any
foreigner with valid international passport or drivers
license and foreign a/c  because the money is in us
dollars and
the former owner of the  a/c  Mr. Keith Lathan Coulter
.
 is a foreigner too, [and the money can only be
approved into a foreign a/c.

However, we will sign a binding agreement,  to bind us
together   I got your contact address  from the Girl
who operates computer,  I am revealing this to you
with believe in God that you will never let me down in
this business,  you are the first and the only person
that I am contacting for this business, so please
reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step
to take urgently.

 Send also your private telephone and fax number
including the full details of the account to be
used for the deposit.

I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and
to sign a binding agreement that will  bind us
together  before transferring the money to any account
of  your choice where the fund will be safe. Before we
fly to your
country for withdrawal, sharing and  investments.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine.
because the management is ready to
approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct
information of this account, which I will give to you,
upon your positive response and once I am convinced
that you  are  capable  and will meet up with
instruction of  a key bank official who is deeply
involved with me in this business.
I need your strong assurance that you will never,
never let me down.

With my influence and the position of the bank
official we can transfer thismoney to any foreigner's
reliable account which you  can provide with assurance
that this money will be intact pending our physical
arrival in your country for sharing.

 The bank official will  destroy all documentsof
transaction immediately we receive this money leaving
no trace to
any place and to build confidence  you can  come
immediately  to discuss with me face to face after
which I will make this remittance in your presence and
three of us will fly to your country at least two days
ahead of the money going into the account.

I will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately
I hear from you that you are ready to act and receive
this fund in your account. I will use my position and
influence to obtain all legal approvals for  onward
transfer of this money to your account with
appropriate clearance from  the relevant  ministries
and foreign exchange departments.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given
35% of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while 5%
will be for expenses both parties might have incurred
during the process of transferring. I will send you my
all  my phone and fax numbers as soon as you indicate
interest in this businesses.

I look forward to your earliest reply through my email
address.
yours truly,
Mr. Kasada Ben,

Sure, that could be the cause of the slowness. It is going to depend on 
lots of different settings and what you are connecting to. The way to 
definitively figure out where the time is going is to run pine with 
timestamping turned on in the debugging. Something like

    pine -d verbose=9,imap=4,timestamp

You may want a lower level verbose.

Then start up pine, notice that it took longer than you'd like, quit and 
look through the timestamps in the debug file for gaps that correspond to 
the delay. It's not trivial but the debugging is verbose enough that you 
may be able to figure out approximately what is going on without knowing 
all about how it works. If you're lucky, a significant portion of the time 
will be taken up by the server responding to a particular command and 
you'll say, "Aha! If I change this config setting that delay might go 
away!". If you're not as lucky, the significant amount of time will just 
be the result of totalling up lots of little times and it won't give you a 
way to fix it, or you'll find the time but you won't understand what pine 
is trying to do, or the delay will happen one time but not the next, and 
so on.

I used to use SetScores and a filtering rule based upon that to filter out
some spam.

I wanted to change it to direct filtering rules that were more logical.

The main rule I'm using is "not to me or my mailing lists", which is
Recip pattern     = !mattack@area.com,trn-users@lists.sourceforge.net,pineinf...

and if it matches this, then the messages go to the suspected spam folder.

The ! is done after the rest, right?

i.e. it's

! (mattack@area.com OR trn-users@lists.sourceforge.net OR ....)

So the rule is only successful if NONE of them are a Recipient.. right?

If not, how can I end up doing this with direct filters?  (because I can't
do a ! on every address in an individual filter, because then everything
would hit one of them)

Right. Just to be clear, the "!" is not typed in as part of the pattern's 
value, "!" is a command that turns Not on or off for a particular pattern. 
So you'd end up with the line looking like

  ! Recip pattern   = abc,def

as opposed to

  Recip pattern     = !abc,def

But, provided that that is what you meant, then the answer is yes. It does 
mean:

   ! (mattack@area.com OR trn-users@lists.sourceforge.net OR ....)

Then that still leads me to wonder why some of my mail is incorrectly being
labelled as spam even though it clearly is directed to me and doesn't
contain words that hit other spam filters (".info", ".biz", etc.)

You could try running pine with

    pine -d verbose=5,imap=4

You would be interested in the debugging output that follows

   process_filter_patterns...

in the debug file. It should tell which filter matchs a message with a 
line like


  FILTER matching "<filter_name>": msg # "filed"              or
                                         "killed"

for each message for which the action is to move it to another folder or 
to delete it. I see that it won't print anything if the filter just sets 
the state or does nothing.

The imap=4 is in the debug so that we might be able to figure out why the 
match didn't happen. There should be imap SEARCH commands interspersed 
between the filters where pine is trying to do the matching. If you 
identify a message that should have matched and didn't, or vice versa, 
find the message and look at the raw message to see if something is 
strange about it that might cause the miss.

Alternatively, you can skip the debug stuff and just try to look at 
messages that get misfiled.

We (pine@cac.washington.edu) are interested in hearing about the results 
or helping by looking at debug files if you think that would help. Thanks.

Market Watch Special Alert achieved record results for 
our Investment Alert for the First Quarter of 2004. 
Our subscribers have pocketed huge gains by revealing 
unknown and undervalued gems thrust into the spotlight.

Results for our First Quarter Investor Alert issued in 
December 2003:
Company Recommended: Torvec, Inc. (TOVC)
Price when recommended: 1.45
Highest price reached: 8.99 (+520%)

Second Quarter Investment Alert:
Deer Park Technology, Inc. (DRPT)

Price: .35

Assets: over 18 Million (2.09 per share)
Est. 2004 EPS: .15 Growth 300%+
Shares Out: 8.6 million
Float: 1.7 million
Average PE: Industry 23-25

Put DRPT on your radar for the purpose of immediate 
investment. Merger completed with 10-year old 
"entertainment empire". Name change imminent to reflect 
a treasure-trove of entertainment media properties.

Stock Performance Guide: DRPT
7 day trading target: 1.20
30 day trading target: 2.50
12-Month Est. Average PE X 2004 EPS =3D 3.75

One glance inside DRPT's programming vault will make you 
realize that there is basically none of the Company's 
intrinsic value reflected in the price of the stock. 
This is a direct result of a stock that is completely 
unknown to investors. Watch how quickly prices roar when 
word spreads, investors grab their calculators, and the 
realization is clear that this stock is trading for just 
pennies on every dollar of tangible assets.

The value of the Company's core assets will force its way 
into the stock price, with this explosive entity stepping 
into the spotlight and evolving DRPT into Media Classics 
International, Inc. Although a new name to investors, Media 
Classics is a major video stock footage company with 
worldwide distribution that has amassed a 3,000 film product 
line since 1994.

An overview of Media Classics' holdings reveals a tremendous 
diversity of entertainment media, started from scratch about 
ten years ago that has subsequently morphed into an almost 
$20 Million asset empire with top award winning producers 
and directors at the helm. 

The Company's entertainment assets are comprised of over 
2,400 hours of stock film footage, documentary and educational 
films, over $8 Million of animated art and programming, 
distribution rights for 110 full-length feature films 
categorized as top box office draws starring Oscar winners 
and a who's-who of Hollywood actors, as well as sports 
programming, and music rights. This complete library is 
distributed worldwide in VHS, DVD, on cable television and 
via the Internet, and is a continuing source of rapidly 
growing revenues. 

Several recent news announcements are well-timed with the 
upcoming corporate name change and will add significant 
value to a growing bottom line. These releases include:
1. The licensing of 36 films for distribution as DVD's 
and home video through a group of entertainment companies.
2. The completion of ten (10) documentaries to be released 
within 60 days produced as a joint venture with well-
known Terramar Productions.
3. A contract to provide entertainment products to the US 
Navy for use on board ship and at Navy bases around the globe. 

Here are some figures that put into perspective the enormous 
potential revenues that are available to industry players 
with diverse entertainment properties. The movie industry 
generates $150 Billion while the entire music industry 
yields $30 Billion worldwide. Video rentals in the US totaled 
$7 Billion, video sales reached $10 Billion, and DVD sales 
totaled $4 Billion for a total of $21 Billion in post-theatrical 
gross profits. With 50% of the wholesale price of a DVD or 
VHS going to the producer or studio, it is clear to aggressive 
investors why DRPT (Media Classics) has become our #1 stock 
pick for 2004.

Murphy,

  What happens in practice is that messages are not being deleted from the
mailbox, they are being hidden. If you removed the filter you would see
all those message reappering in the index (maybe in another session of
Pine), with the "D" next to them.

:) Is there a way to set Pine to allow the INBOX file to be updated
:) without a necessity to quit Pine and run it again?

Not sure if this would work, by try pressing "X" (for expunge) in the
inbox. If that doesn't work (because there are no messages in the inbox),
send a message to yourself, delete it and expunge it. Does that work?

Yes, you are right - pine filter the messages into proper folders, but
it didn't remove the sources as long as it is opened. I opened the
second pine from which I could see this same INBOX and the message had
a two states "N" and "D" even if from the first pine the message was
already deleted.

So, is there a way that pine could move these messages and remove the
source after filters will finish its job?

I try it, and there is no difference. In fact I always expunge the
deleted messages automatically when I go to the different folder.

This behaviour of pine is strange for me. When I used the Netscape
mailer long ago then after filtering the original source (INBOX) was
cleaned up, so it was possible to have a correct state on the mail
checker, which could only see an empty file (after Netscape cleaning).

So I now wonder why pine is so different in this matter. :|

Murphy

:) I try it, and there is no difference. In fact I always expunge the
:) deleted messages automatically when I go to the different folder.

That's why I was not sure, I think I know what's going on from the point
of view of source code, and it probably means that there's nothing you can
do. I think that part of the problem is that the c-client library does not
(and will not according to a message I read once from Mark Crispin)
implement expunging on a "by message number" basis (which is what should
happen, but Pine instead hides those messages). I was thinking that maybe
a global expunge would trigger the server (or Pine) to expunge those
messages, but it does not as you just checked.

I don't think there's any sensible thing to do about your problem. For
example, one could write a program that expunges deleted messages from a
folder, but then depending on your folder format, you may loose access to
your inbox, which is not a big problem, but an annoying one to have. This
is a shortcoming of Pine (not of filters in Pine).

I wonder what people that never close Pine do. It seems that this is a
sure way to go over quota (and yes I know a place where the spool is under
quota, so ignoring it or saying that memory is cheap is not the solution
of the problem).

pine 4.44 on Solaris 9:

I have pine filter mail out of the exchange server
into local mailboxes (accessible to grep and
emacs). Stuff that I don't have filters for stays
in the (exchange) IMAP server INBOX until I cycle
around the NewMail folders and look at it again.
When I do, I usually do an xy to expunge the
e-mail I deleted by hand.

When pine disconnects from the IMAP server for
some reason (they boot it from time to time), when
I restart pine to get it to reconnect, it
refilters some old mail so there are two copies in
the local mailboxes of some messages. Annoying,
but never a *terribly* large quantity.

Hi,

I have moved from pico to vim as standard editor to compose mail,
because I am currently learning vim and this forces me to use it. :-)

However, sometimes it happens that I get confused. For example, I quite
vim after the composing is done and I use "k" to move one line up in the
header section. This does not work, because it is a vim command and not
a pine/pico command.

Is there a way that pine behaves like vi?

Greetings,
Claus

PS: I know that mutt would be a good alternative, but I am happy with
pine so far and want to avoid to spend time moving to another mail app.

You can always set the pine to call the external editor when you move
into a body of the e-mail (the headers has to be written in pine). So
when you will finish to write text you will go back to the pine to
send/postpone/cancel the message.

If it is ok for you, then you can set the "editor" in your setup
screen to "vim" and set the "enable-alternate-editor-implicitly".

Murphy

Use Setup -> Config

Activate the options 

enable-alternate-editor-cmd
enable-alternate-editor-implicitly

Set 'editor' value to /your/bin/path/vim

On your environment set EDITOR variable to /your/bin/path/vim

This should do the thing.

This is what I am doing currently already. But it is confusing, because
I use Vim commands for editing and Pico commands for the rest. I would
like to have Vim commands all over, also for editing the header, config
stuff, etc.

Well, just wondering. I don't have much hope that this is possible.
Anyway, thanks for your reply!

I do agree with Claus -- it would be a nice feature if it were possible
to edit the email headers along with the rest of the body using vi/vim.

Yeah. Even after using Pine/vi together for 3 years now, I still sometimes
hit an arrow key or vi command when in the headers.

Market Watch News Flash

Explosive short term trading profits in a new technology
issue (Ticker: SRGE) are being predicted as many 
significant news releases indicate strong contractual 
revenues with major Telecom firms. 

SRGE has been successfully working with Telecommunications 
giants (with five million subscriber lines) over the last 4 
years, but is now projecting "a banner expansion year with 
geometric growth in revenues" due largely to sales demands 
for their innovative patented products and expansion into 
International telecom markets.

Surge Technologies, Inc. (SRGE) is a cutting-edge leader 
that designs, develops, manufactures, and markets superior 
patented outside plant electrical surge protection 
equipment for the telecommunications industry.
The US sales projections for this market are $4 Billion 
annually, with this figure growing rapidly as the 
expansion of new HDSL and ADSL technologies permeate 
the industry.

SRGE provides the Telecom industry with the highest 
quality "protection element" for complex digital switches. 
Protecting these Telecom switching devices is crucial to 
inclusive components that are sensitive to interruptions 
in voltage which can cause extensive network damage, thus 
negating costly and time-consuming repair and down-time.
Major Telecoms require this protection throughout their 
network in order to prevent the hazards of harming 
personnel, damaging expensive equipment, and massive 
system failures.

How many times have you seen issues explode but you 
couldn't get your hands on them or didn't have the right 
information in time? We are alerting you now to a special 
Company with a unique technology that is on the forefront 
of a breakout! We are excited about SRGE's technology 
and expansion as they prepare to ink deal after deal with 
Major US Telecoms in conjunction with dramatic increases 
in revenue for 2004 and 2005. SRGE has made phenomenal 
advancements but may be one of the few stocks left in 
this industry group that is unknown and undervalued, 
therefore a 300%-400% jump may wind up being conservative.

Hello,

Let's say I use a sending-filter to process all mail that I send.  I was 
wondering if there is a way for my filter program to stop pine from 
sending the particular mail (if the filter decides that a particular mail 
should not be sent).

I'd prefer to stop message sending completely (I don't want to just erase 
the message content and send an empty message).

I would appreciate any help on whether this can be done and how.

Thanks

Lukasz

Make your filter remove the file that it processed. When Pine does not 
find it, it will send you an error message. A more elegant way is to make 
the filter exit with a return value different from zero, but that I don't 
recall correctly, so try it before you use.

In fact I'm not using a file from server as an INBOX, but just normal
file which is initially pre-filtered by procmail. So, from my
perspective filters should do (and they partially does) the things
which they suppose to do - move, for instance, the e-mails from one
folder (file) to another, means delete them also from the source
location (this is a definition of "move", not "copy"). If it would be
done like this (preferably configurable in the setup screen), then It
would be no problem.

Looking for temporary workaround is not the way I would like to do,
even if it would be possible (for instance make a script which would
rename the original file to the new name and create the empty INBOX.
But I'm afraid that it can do some harm when such a script will do
its work when actually a part of a new message will try to append
itself to the end of INBOX file. So, perfectly it would be that Pine
could do this work. I wish developers will add something like this in
the near future to the Pine.

For my case the quota is not a problem because I have no quota at all,
and all e-mails are immediately redirected from the mail server to the
local home directory. It is just big inconvenience if I have to close
and open the Pine again just for updating my mail checker.

Thanks Eduardo for explaining me the source of the problem. I hope
that Pine developers will find some solution for that.

Murphy

I checked what the "Mutt 1.4.2.1i" does about this INBOX when the
deleted messages are expunged. It actually does what it should - it
removes the messages from the INBOX, so there is no need to exit/open
it again just to have updated INBOX file.

Looks like in this round the score is 1:0 to Mutt. :(

Murphy

Hello,

I am seeking help for a question from one of our professors
who uses pine and wants to read MS words documents through 
locally installed antiword application. I don't have much 
experience with pine and appreciate you help.

Thank you in advance

Thanks a lot.  It ended up being user-error.

After nuking most of my old filters and starting over, I tried a "spam words"
filter (and mentioning this may hit some others' filters.. ohwell)

My filter was:
viagra,cialis,viag,cial,microsoft security,memolink.com

and duhh, I just realizec that "cial" is in a lot of words!  Heh.

Darn, if I could do "^cial" or something for start-of-word, this would
still be a reasonable filter.. (Since of course viagra and cialis don't
appear as full words too often anymore.)

and btw, this is *after* spamassassin runs.. a lot of stuff still gets
in my inbox.  The stuff that spamassassin gets goes directly to /dev/null.

I used to be paranoid about spamassassin catching good mail, but I have only
ever seen my own filters (like the above!) goof up.

I recommend that before you try to detect spam, you first detect
non-spam. One way to do that within Pine is to filter all
messages from addresses in your address book by using this type
of condition:

 From or ReplyTo is in address book? =
            Set    Choose One
            ---  --------------------
            ( )  Don't care, always matches
            (*)  Yes, in any address book
            ( )  No, not in any address book
            ( )  Yes, in specific address books
            ( )  No, not in any of specific address books
                 Abook List = <No Value Set>

and then put everyone you correspond with in your address book!
I discuss this type of "reverse spam filtering" here:

 <http://www.ii.com/internet/messaging/spam/>

If you use procmail, you could try LOAF, which is a a GPL'd
distributed social network filter that automatically "greenlists"
your pine address book and the address book of your
correspondents (and the address book of your correspondents'
correspondents, ad infinitum if you like!). Details are here:

 <http://loaf.cantbedone.org/>

Hope this is helful,
Nancy

I'm largely a filter-hater.  For the most part, I only filter spam (and
I philosophically disagree with that, but it's gotten too voluminous to
complain about all of it), and on my work account one of the mailing lists
I'm on to another folder.

Basically, could this detect non-spam tactic work if I by default want
stuff to REMAIN in my INBOX?  I don't think it will, because I think it would
just keep hitting the rest of the filtering rules and thus possibly be
triggered by one of them.

Actually, one of my recent tactics (which started this or one of the other
threads I sent recently) was sort of trying to accomplish the same goal as
your addressbook one is -- I was trying to assume messages that weren't to
me or my mailing lists were spam..  But that didn't seem to work well.

If I can add all of my mailing lists to my address book, add another rule
or two (looking for a Newsgroups: header for example because about the
only stuff I get on my personal acct besides some mailing lists is replies
to Usenet postings), then anything ELSE is assumed to be spam..  then
that would probably help a lot.

I'll still manually skim my suspected_spam folder, but it'd be a start.

**SRGE****SRGE****SRGE****SRGE****SRGE****SRGE**

Market Watch News Flash

Explosive short term trading profits in a new technology
issue (Ticker: SRGE) are being predicted as many 
significant news releases indicate strong contractual 
revenues with major Telecom firms. 

SRGE has been successfully working with Telecommunications 
giants (with five million subscriber lines) over the last 4 
years, but is now projecting "a banner expansion year with 
geometric growth in revenues" due largely to sales demands 
for their innovative patented products and expansion into 
International telecom markets.

Surge Technologies, Inc. (SRGE) is a cutting-edge leader 
that designs, develops, manufactures, and markets superior 
patented outside plant electrical surge protection 
equipment for the telecommunications industry.
The US sales projections for this market are $4 Billion 
annually, with this figure growing rapidly as the 
expansion of new HDSL and ADSL technologies permeate 
the industry.

SRGE provides the Telecom industry with the highest 
quality "protection element" for complex digital switches. 
Protecting these Telecom switching devices is crucial to 
inclusive components that are sensitive to interruptions 
in voltage which can cause extensive network damage, thus 
negating costly and time-consuming repair and down-time.
Major Telecoms require this protection throughout their 
network in order to prevent the hazards of harming 
personnel, damaging expensive equipment, and massive 
system failures.

Opening Price: 1.15
10 Day Target: 2.30
1 Month Target: 4.50
Outstanding Shares: 16.5 million
Est. Float: 2.2 million

How many times have you seen issues explode but you 
couldn't get your hands on them or didn't have the right 
information in time? We are alerting you now to a special 
Company with a unique technology that is on the forefront 
of a breakout! We are excited about SRGE's technology 
and expansion as they prepare to ink deal after deal with 
Major US Telecoms in conjunction with dramatic increases 
in revenue for 2004 and 2005. SRGE has made phenomenal 
advancements but may be one of the few stocks left in 
this industry group that is unknown and undervalued, 
therefore a 300%-400% jump may wind up being conservative.

I just moved my hosting to a new site, whose sysadmin set up Pine for 
me. I can receive mail but cannot send. Pine provides the exceedingly 
helpful error message [Mail not sent: email client.]

Where does one set up the various intricacies of SMTP servers? Yes, 
I've checked Setup --> Config and it appears I have everything filled 
out correctly.

I would leave the entry for SMTP server at Setup -> Config empty. If
this does not work, I would ask the Sysadmin what SMTP server you need
to set.

Market Watch News Flash

Explosive short term trading profits in a new technology
issue (Ticker: SRGE) are being predicted as many 
significant news releases indicate strong contractual 
revenues with major Telecom firms. 

SRGE has been successfully working with Telecommunications 
giants (with five million subscriber lines) over the last 4 
years, but is now projecting "a banner expansion year with 
geometric growth in revenues" due largely to sales demands 
for their innovative patented products and expansion into 
International telecom markets.

Surge Technologies, Inc. (SRGE) is a cutting-edge leader 
that designs, develops, manufactures, and markets superior 
patented outside plant electrical surge protection 
equipment for the telecommunications industry.
The US sales projections for this market are $4 Billion 
annually, with this figure growing rapidly as the 
expansion of new HDSL and ADSL technologies permeate 
the industry.

SRGE provides the Telecom industry with the highest 
quality "protection element" for complex digital switches. 
Protecting these Telecom switching devices is crucial to 
inclusive components that are sensitive to interruptions 
in voltage which can cause extensive network damage, thus 
negating costly and time-consuming repair and down-time.
Major Telecoms require this protection throughout their 
network in order to prevent the hazards of harming 
personnel, damaging expensive equipment, and massive 
system failures.

10 Day Target: 2.30
1 Month Target: 4.50
Outstanding Shares: 16.5 million
Est. Float: 2.2 million

How many times have you seen issues explode but you 
couldn't get your hands on them or didn't have the right 
information in time? We are alerting you now to a special 
Company with a unique technology that is on the forefront 
of a breakout! We are excited about SRGE's technology 
and expansion as they prepare to ink deal after deal with 
Major US Telecoms in conjunction with dramatic increases 
in revenue for 2004 and 2005. SRGE has made phenomenal 
advancements but may be one of the few stocks left in 
this industry group that is unknown and undervalued, 
therefore a 300%-400% jump may wind up being conservative.

As it turns out, I re-RTFMed and found that the entry to use is 
_localhost_. Don't leave home without it.

**SRGE****SRGE****SRGE****SRGE****SRGE****SRGE**

Market Watch News Flash

Explosive short term trading profits in a new technology
issue (Ticker: SRGE) are being predicted as many 
significant news releases indicate strong contractual 
revenues with major Telecom firms. 

SRGE has been successfully working with Telecommunications 
giants (with five million subscriber lines) over the last 4 
years, but is now projecting "a banner expansion year with 
geometric growth in revenues" due largely to sales demands 
for their innovative patented products and expansion into 
International telecom markets.

Surge Technologies, Inc. (SRGE) is a cutting-edge leader 
that designs, develops, manufactures, and markets superior 
patented outside plant electrical surge protection 
equipment for the telecommunications industry.
The US sales projections for this market are $4 Billion 
annually, with this figure growing rapidly as the 
expansion of new HDSL and ADSL technologies permeate 
the industry.

SRGE provides the Telecom industry with the highest 
quality "protection element" for complex digital switches. 
Protecting these Telecom switching devices is crucial to 
inclusive components that are sensitive to interruptions 
in voltage which can cause extensive network damage, thus 
negating costly and time-consuming repair and down-time.
Major Telecoms require this protection throughout their 
network in order to prevent the hazards of harming 
personnel, damaging expensive equipment, and massive 
system failures.

Opening Price: 1.15
10 Day Target: 2.30
1 Month Target: 4.50
Outstanding Shares: 16.5 million
Est. Float: 2.2 million

How many times have you seen issues explode but you 
couldn't get your hands on them or didn't have the right 
information in time? We are alerting you now to a special 
Company with a unique technology that is on the forefront 
of a breakout! We are excited about SRGE's technology 
and expansion as they prepare to ink deal after deal with 
Major US Telecoms in conjunction with dramatic increases 
in revenue for 2004 and 2005. SRGE has made phenomenal 
advancements but may be one of the few stocks left in 
this industry group that is unknown and undervalued, 
therefore a 300%-400% jump may wind up being conservative.

Hi,

Right now, I quit and re-start Pine whenever I want to move the read
messages in my inbox to my Read Messages folder.

Moving those messages without quitting would mean that I have to do the
following steps:

1 - select all read messages
2 - copy them to the Read Message folder
3 - mark the for being deleted
3 - eXpunge

Is there an easier way to empty the inbox, for example, having Pine to
move read messages when pressing x (eXpunge)?

Thanks for your input!
Claus

Have you tried setting up a filter?   M S R F


Condition: all read messages in specific mailbox which has been "read"

Action: Move those messages to Read Messages and set the 'delete' flag

        -- or --

        Delete messages


Then every time you visit the specific mailbox, the filter kicks in.

This does not work, since I am not visiting the Inbox, but I am already
there.

This is my workflow:

1 - Open Pine
2 - Read mail in Inbox
3 - Want to apply moving read mail and deleting them from inbox

I did not leave the Inbox.

Greetings,
Claus

*** if you make the rule, go to into Inbox, read a message and press
eXpunge-it should apply the rule on read message.

You can have a filter which matches and does nothing. Set it to "Just Set 
Message Status" and then have it set nothing. If a message matches that 
filter, nothing will be done to it and it won't be eligible to be matched 
by filter rules which follow that rule. So it will just be left in the 
INBOX.

The UW uses WebPine for its students and faculty to access their email 
accounts.  I would like to use it on my system as a web email frontend.  
Where do I get it?

Is there a way to filter based on the members of a
particular group/distribution list, in an addressbook?

Currently I have a 'friends' rule which has a whole bunch
of email addresses in to move read mail from friends into
a folder.  I also have a 'friends' distribution list in
my address book which has all their addresses.  Currently
to keep the rule in line with the alias any time I add
a new friend (or more likely they change email address ;-) )
I need to add it in both the addressbook and the filter rule.

Ideally what I'd want would be able to have an extra prompt
in the 'filter by address book' which allowed a particular
alias inside the selected addressbook.

Or is there another way (short of adding a whole address
book for the one distribution list)?

Maybe you could create a separate address book for these friends and
use a filter role, where you could say any address from this specific
address book.

Id like to submit a request (I looked at the website, but didnt see
anywhere to submit requests):


An option to put the "(fwd)" at beginning of the Subject line instead of
at the end.



Thanks.

Hello!

I try to use PC-Pine with Microsoft Exchange 2003 and it seems to work
basically. I read Pine-Exchange-Mini-Howto and added folder lists

{server/user=3Dme}inbox/[]
{server/user=3Dme}[]

and folder {server/user=3Dme}inbox as inbox

the folder collection looks like

    &ANY-ffentliche Ordner//
    Aufgaben[/]
    Entw&APw-rfe[/]
    Gel&APY-schte Objekte[/]
    Kontakte[/]

I have problems accessing the public folders in Exchange, there named
"=D6ffentliche Ordner" (german) and I see it in the list as "&ANY-ffentlich=
e
Ordner//". It is empty (ENTER) and has no subfolders (>) but in fact it
has the least: If I add the additional inbox "&ANY-ffentliche
Ordner/Inbox" I get the public folder "Inbox" and can read those mails.

But how do I get Pine to read the subfolders of the public folder? I added
folder collection {server/user=3Dme}&ANY-ffentliche Ordner/[] which didn't
had any effect. I can also goto {server/user=3Dme}&ANY-ffentliche
Ordner/anyfoldername and list the contents of public folder
"anyfoldername".

BTW: I'm quite satisfied with pine in general but listing Exchange folders
is quite non-intuitive. Here it's a disadvantage not to have the
possibility of a hierarchical folder tree as I have to look into each
folder by ">" to see whether subfolders exist.

BTW2: Access to public folders is quite slow, is there anything to tune
up?

BTW3: The german umlauts are quite cryptic encoded (see above). It's just
for the optic, but is it changeable (but I guess only Exchange can change
this...)

Best regards
Stefan

Manufacture of the Environmentally Friendly Biosphere 
Process System "waste-to-energy" Units in the United States. 

First Unit to Roll-out in New Orleans in early Second Quarter. 

We are expecting earth-shattering upcoming news leading a 
strong rally in LETH for a Company that has announced over 
$100 Million in sales orders in the past year, and tops that 
record-setting achievement by acquiring the equivalent of 
$8.62 per share in cash for major worldwide expansion.

The Biosphere Process System - Soaring Worldwide Demand:

LETH is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their 
Biosphere Process System to generate revenue from the disposal 
of a wide variety of waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour 
which makes a major impact on the global waste problem. This 
profitable and environmentally safe process converts into clean, 
"green" electricity such waste materials as Municipal Solid 
Waste, agricultural wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes, 
industrial wastes, sewage sludge, shale oil, sour natural gas, 
and the huge market of used tires. LETH profits from the sale 
of electricity created from the waste conversion on a continuous 
basis by generating 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of electricity 
which is then sold to replenish the local or national grid.

The Biosphere Process succeeds in filling an urgent worldwide 
need for cost-effective renewable energy sources and a 
corresponding universal need to solve critical problems in the 
disposal of waste. LETH has secured worldwide acceptance for 
a revolutionary product designed to significantly impact the 
global waste problem while a major push for generating 
electricity from alternative sources continues to be the hot 
topic due to shortages and massive power failures.

Financing of $250 Million Positions LETH for Astronomical Sales:

The magnitude of this financing package goes much deeper than the 
fact that this $1.50 stock now has accessible capital equivalent 
to $8.62 per common share in cash. There are 26 Biosphere Process 
Systems presently in operation worldwide. The available funding 
could easily be used to produce 100 additional Biospheres. Now 
factor in that average sale price is $7 Million per Biosphere. 
We cannot even comprehend what this stock should be trading for 
with a potential $700,000,000 in future sales with 29 million 
shares outstanding!

LETH Stock Guidance:
Current Price: 1.55
Near-Term Target: 4.80
Projected High for '04: 12.50

LETH's Blue Chip Partner - Fortifying the System:

LETH is an alliance partner with Tetra Tech, Inc. (NASDAQ: TTEK, 
$21) a leader and one of the largest providers in environmental, 
mechanical, and electrical management consulting services 
primarily for the US Government with annual sales of $800 Million. 
Tetra Tech will coordinate the securing of necessary permits, 
installation, and continuous worldwide monitoring of the 
Biosphere Process System for LETH. Tetra Tech is now in the 
process of obtaining Department of Environmental Quality 
permitting for the Biosphere Process in the state of Louisiana. 
This is a monumental event for LETH which opens the floodgates 
for major project revenues in Louisiana while having a parallel
effect on LETH stock in the form of a huge near-term announcement.

Political Power Fosters Rapid Global Expansion:

LETH has captured the profit-making attention of both US and 
international investors by embracing a major foothold on the 
global waste problem as well as the urgent need to generate 
electricity from alternative sources. This has been accomplished 
by successfully creating major inroads to all corners of the 
globe through the political contacts at the highest level from Dr. 
Albert Reynolds, Chairman of LETH, who is also the former Prime 
Minister of Ireland. Dr. Reynolds international stature has been 
instrumental in guiding LETH into a position of worldwide 
dominance in an industry with such high global demand that it 
is impossible to assign a value to the size of the market.

Uncommon Value for a Company of this Caliber:

We are witnessing a breakout year in the making judging by the 
frequency of recently announced sales contracts for the Biosphere, 
the impressive backlog of over $100 Million in sales orders, and 
the Company's very solid financial position. We view this perfectly 
timed convergence of events as the catalyst for additional contracts 
that will perpetuate the shattering of the Company's own sales 
records. As our Top Stock Pick for April, we anticipate the 
continuation of strong positive developments that will ignite 
LETH shares which carry our highest rating for short-term trading 
profits followed by robust long-term capital gains.

<HTML><DIV class=bgcolor STYLE="background-color: ;"><P>Dear
Friend,<BR>I am TONY AHMED the head of Account and
Audit<BR>Depertment in one of the banks in Ouagadougou
,Burkina<BR>Faso . I know this is coming to you as a surprise
,do<BR>not be,as i am writing to you following the
impressive<BR>information about you through one of my friends
who<BR>works with the investment bureau section of
burkina<BR>faso chamber of commerce and industry recommended
your<BR>person to me and advise that i should ask you
for<BR>help. <BR>He assured me of your capability and
reliability to<BR>champion this business opportunity. <BR>In my
department we discovered an abandoned sum of $<BR>10.5m US
dollars(Ten million, five hundred thousand US<BR>dollars) .
<BR>In an account that belongs to one of our foreign<BR>customer
who died a long with his entire family in<BR>16th Nov,2000 in an
auto crash. <BR>Since we got information about his death, we
have been<BR>expecting his next of kin to come over and claim
his<BR>money because we cannot release it unless
somebody<BR>applies for it as next of kin or relation to
the<BR>deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines
but<BR>unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next
of<BR>kin or relation died alongside with him leaving<BR>nobody
behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this<BR>discovery
that I and other officials in my department<BR>now decided to
make this business proposal to you and<BR>release the money to
you as the next of kin or<BR>relation to the deceased for safety
and subsequent<BR>disbursement since nobody is coming for it and
we<BR>don't want this money to go into the Bank treasury
as<BR>unclaimed Bill. <BR>The Banking law and guideline here
stipulates that if<BR>such money remained Unclaimed after four
years, the<BR>money will be transferred into the Bank treasury
as<BR>unclaimed fund. <BR>The request of foreigner as next of
kin in this<BR>business is occasioned by the fact that the
customer<BR>was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as
next<BR>of kin to a foreigner. <BR>We agree that 30 % of this
money will be for you as<BR>foreign partner,in respect to the
provision of a<BR>foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for
expenses<BR>incurred during the business and 60 % would be for
me<BR>and my colleagues. There after I and my colleagues<BR>will
visit your country for disbursement according to<BR>the
percentages indicated. <BR>Therefore to enable the immediate
transfer of this<BR>fund to you as arranged, you must apply
first to the<BR>bank as relations or next of kin of the
deceased<BR>indicating your bank name, your bank account
number,<BR>your private telephone and fax number for easy
and<BR>effective communication and location where the
money<BR>will be remitted . </P>
<P>Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax<BR>or
email the text of the application. I will not fail<BR>to bring
to your notice that this transaction is hitch<BR>free and that
you should not entertain any atom of<BR>fear as all required
arrangements have been made for<BR>the transfer . <BR>You should
contact me immediately as soon as you<BR>receive this letter.
<BR>Trusting to hear from you immediately. </P>
<P>Your's faithfully, <BR>TONY AHMED </P>

Hello,

it's not fine to answer my own mail, but I figured out more details:

(imap commands follow, just some snippets)

IMAP: 00000003 RLIST "" %
...
IMAP: * LIST (\Marked \HasNoChildren) "/" INBOX
IMAP: * LIST (\HasChildren) "/" Synchronisierungsprobleme
IMAP: * LIST (\Noselect) "/" "&ANY-ffentliche Ordner/"

Exchange gives this folder including some hierarchy separator as last
char. Pine now adds another hierarchy separator and

IMAP: 00000003 RLIST "&ANY-ffentliche Ordner//" %
IMAP: 00000003 NO This a special mailbox and can not be selected or used as the destination for mailbox operations.

So this doesn't work. I did some IMAP test and

IMAP: TAG123 RLIST "&ANY-ffentliche Ordner/" %

works just fine.

Question1: Can this be fixed in pine if it is a bug in exchange? Most
other IMAP clients seem not to have problems here (perhaps they don't add
the additional "/" for listing subfolders?)

Question2: Is it possible to add some translation for those
Unicode-Foldernames? At least for some often used chars like german
umlauts?

Regards
Stefan

Hello,

additional note. Setting up another folder collection in pine fails, too:

"FolderCollectionName" {server/user=me}&ANY-ffentliche Ordner/[]

This collection shows up as empty, but pine does not try to populate it
via IMAP RLIST (seen in Journal, debug=4).

Best regards
Stefan
