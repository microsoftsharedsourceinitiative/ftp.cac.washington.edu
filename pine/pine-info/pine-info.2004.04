April 2004 Top Pick of the Month
Life Energy and Technology Holdings, Inc.
(OTCBB: LETH)

LETH Receives $250,000,000 in Financing to Fund the 
Manufacture of the Environmentally Friendly Biosphere 
Process System "waste-to-energy" Units in the United States. 

First Unit to Roll-out in New Orleans in early Second Quarter. 

We are expecting earth-shattering upcoming news leading a 
strong rally in LETH for a Company that has announced over 
$100 Million in sales orders in the past year, and tops that 
record-setting achievement by acquiring the equivalent of 
$8.62 per share in cash for major worldwide expansion.

**Our readers grabbed substantial profits for our March pick**
USHG featured at .75
Reached 3.65 in 8 days!
Traded as high as 4.55 since!

The Biosphere Process System - Soaring Worldwide Demand:

LETH is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their 
Biosphere Process System to generate revenue from the disposal 
of a wide variety of waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour 
which makes a major impact on the global waste problem. This 
profitable and environmentally safe process converts into clean, 
"green" electricity such waste materials as Municipal Solid 
Waste, agricultural wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes, 
industrial wastes, sewage sludge, shale oil, sour natural gas, 
and the huge market of used tires. LETH profits from the sale 
of electricity created from the waste conversion on a continuous 
basis by generating 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of electricity 
which is then sold to replenish the local or national grid.

The Biosphere Process succeeds in filling an urgent worldwide 
need for cost-effective renewable energy sources and a 
corresponding universal need to solve critical problems in the 
disposal of waste. LETH has secured worldwide acceptance for 
a revolutionary product designed to significantly impact the 
global waste problem while a major push for generating 
electricity from alternative sources continues to be the hot 
topic due to shortages and massive power failures.

Financing of $250 Million Positions LETH for Astronomical Sales:

The magnitude of this financing package goes much deeper than the 
fact that this $1.50 stock now has accessible capital equivalent 
to $8.62 per common share in cash. There are 26 Biosphere Process 
Systems presently in operation worldwide. The available funding 
could easily be used to produce 100 additional Biospheres. Now 
factor in that average sale price is $7 Million per Biosphere. 
We cannot even comprehend what this stock should be trading for 
with a potential $700,000,000 in future sales with 29 million 
shares outstanding!

LETH Stock Guidance:
Current Price: 1.60
Near-Term Target: 4.80
Projected High for '04: 12.50

LETH's Blue Chip Partner - Fortifying the System:

LETH is an alliance partner with Tetra Tech, Inc. (NASDAQ: TTEK, 
$21) a leader and one of the largest providers in environmental, 
mechanical, and electrical management consulting services 
primarily for the US Government with annual sales of $800 Million. 
Tetra Tech will coordinate the securing of necessary permits, 
installation, and continuous worldwide monitoring of the 
Biosphere Process System for LETH. Tetra Tech is now in the 
process of obtaining Department of Environmental Quality 
permitting for the Biosphere Process in the state of Louisiana. 
This is a monumental event for LETH which opens the floodgates 
for major project revenues in Louisiana while having a parallel
effect on LETH stock in the form of a huge near-term announcement.

Political Power Fosters Rapid Global Expansion:

LETH has captured the profit-making attention of both US and 
international investors by embracing a major foothold on the 
global waste problem as well as the urgent need to generate 
electricity from alternative sources. This has been accomplished 
by successfully creating major inroads to all corners of the 
globe through the political contacts at the highest level from Dr. 
Albert Reynolds, Chairman of LETH, who is also the former Prime 
Minister of Ireland. Dr. Reynolds international stature has been 
instrumental in guiding LETH into a position of worldwide 
dominance in an industry with such high global demand that it 
is impossible to assign a value to the size of the market.

Uncommon Value for a Company of this Caliber:

We are witnessing a breakout year in the making judging by the 
frequency of recently announced sales contracts for the Biosphere, 
the impressive backlog of over $100 Million in sales orders, and 
the Company's very solid financial position. We view this perfectly 
timed convergence of events as the catalyst for additional contracts 
that will perpetuate the shattering of the Company's own sales 
records. As our Top Stock Pick for April, we anticipate the 
continuation of strong positive developments that will ignite 
LETH shares which carry our highest rating for short-term trading 
profits followed by robust long-term capital gains.

Good day, 

Getting your contact was not an easy task because
since I am not computer literate, if you rely
solely on God, you will never go wrong. 

My name is JANG DOO-HWAN, The brother of Mr. CHUN
DOO-HWAN, the former President of South Korea who
seized power in a military coup in 1979 and who ruled
from 1979 to 1987. My brother was pushed out of office
and charged with treason ,corruption and embezzlement
of over 21billion won. 

He was wrongly sentenced to death but fortunately
AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL stepped in and commuted the
sentence to life. We thank God that he has finally
being released though still under house arrest in the
sense of conditions of the freedom. During my
brother's regime as president of South Korea, we
realized some reasonable amount of money from various
deals that we successfully executed. I have plans to
invest this money for my children’s future on real
estate and industrial production. 

Before my brother's was overthrown, I secretly
siphoned the sum of $30,000,000 million USD (Thirty
million United states dollars) out of Seoul and
deposited the money with a security firm that
transports valuable goods and consignments through
diplomatic means. I am contacting you because I want
you to deal with the security company and claim the
money on my behalf since I have declared that the
consignment belong to my foreign business partner. You
shall also be required to assist me in investment in
your country. I hope to trust you as a God fearing
person who will not sit on this money when you claim
it, rather assist me properly, I expect you to declare
what percentage of the total money you will take for
your assistance. When I receive your positive response
I will let you know where the security company is and
the payment pin code to claim the money which is very
important. What we need is to indicate your interest
that you will assist us by receiving the money on our
behalf in Europe or with special arrangement, you can
get it transfered to you by bank transfer 

. For this, you shall be considered to be the
beneficiary of the money. The project in brief, is
that the funds with which we intend to carry out our
proposed investments in your country, is presently in
the custody of a Diplomatic Courier Services Company
in Europe. We cannot do this ourselves because we do
not have any relatives living outside South Korea and
moreover we do not want the government of my Country
to know about the money because they will believe I
got the money from my brother while he was still in
office as president .Once you confirm the receipt of
the money ,I will come over with my Children to your
Country or any Country in Europe to start a new life
with my Family. As soon as payment is effected, and
the amount mentioned above is successfully transferred
into your account, we intend to use our own share in
acquiring some estates abroad. For this too you shall
also be our overseas manager of all our properties and
you will be paid based on a certain percentage agreed
on by both parties. For now, let all our communication
be by e-mail because my line is right now connected to
the South Korean Telecommunication Network services
therefore we can not take the chances of being heard.
Please also send me your telephone and fax number. I
will ask my son to contact you to give you more
details on after I have received a response from you.
I am going to introduce you to him as an age long
friend so as to prevent him from using any of his own
friends who I regard as sycophants who are around him
for financial gains and treacherous if he gives them
this opportunity. This I got from the experience I had
when the people turned against Chun, my brother that
became the prelude of our sorrow. The reason why it
took this long was that the security company’s
agreement with me was that my brother must personally
sign the Power of Attorney that will transfer title to
the prospective beneficiary. It was a long wait but it
paid off. His excellency, Chun Doo-Hwan does not want
to be personally involved for security reason. Your
quick response will be highly appreciated. Thank you
in anticipation of your cooperation. 
You can also reach me on my alternative email
address:jangdoo@telstra.com

Yours faithfully, 

JANG DOO-HWAN.

As much of an IMAP fan as I am, I'm actually using direct mbox access on
my personal account (since I ssh in there already -- I used to use IMAP,
but it's faster if I don't and the mail server they're using barfs if I try
to connect with multiple clients anyway)..

Anyway..  So I'm trying out this new "not in address book" filter that
was recently described.  Mostly it's working pretty well, but every
once in a while I'm still getting things in my suspected_spam
folder.. such as addresses I forgot to add.

Anyway, how can I save these messages back to my INBOX?  On my
work account, I can simply do a Save, type INBOX, and it works.

But here, it says it saves, but the message never shows up in the INBOX.
(It's not getting refiltered either.)  Same thing if I try to save to
Mailbox.

The setting on this acct is:
inbox-path                    = Mailbox

I could forward it to myself and have done that in the past, but that
adds the extra fwd info and then shows up as coming from me.

Is there some way I can move messages back to my INBOX in this case?

April 2004 Top Pick of the Month
Life Energy and Technology Holdings, Inc.
(OTCBB: LETH)

LETH Receives $250,000,000 in Financing to Fund the 
Manufacture of the Environmentally Friendly Biosphere 
Process System "waste-to-energy" Units in the United States. 

First Unit to Roll-out in New Orleans in early Second Quarter. 

We are expecting earth-shattering upcoming news leading a 
strong rally in LETH for a Company that has announced over 
$100 Million in sales orders in the past year, and tops that 
record-setting achievement by acquiring the equivalent of 
$8.62 per share in cash for major worldwide expansion.

**Our readers grabbed substantial profits for our March pick**
USHG featured at .75
Reached 3.65 in 8 days!
Traded as high as 4.55 since!

The Biosphere Process System - Soaring Worldwide Demand:

LETH is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their 
Biosphere Process System to generate revenue from the disposal 
of a wide variety of waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour 
which makes a major impact on the global waste problem. This 
profitable and environmentally safe process converts into clean, 
"green" electricity such waste materials as Municipal Solid 
Waste, agricultural wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes, 
industrial wastes, sewage sludge, shale oil, sour natural gas, 
and the huge market of used tires. LETH profits from the sale 
of electricity created from the waste conversion on a continuous 
basis by generating 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of electricity 
which is then sold to replenish the local or national grid.

The Biosphere Process succeeds in filling an urgent worldwide 
need for cost-effective renewable energy sources and a 
corresponding universal need to solve critical problems in the 
disposal of waste. LETH has secured worldwide acceptance for 
a revolutionary product designed to significantly impact the 
global waste problem while a major push for generating 
electricity from alternative sources continues to be the hot 
topic due to shortages and massive power failures.

Financing of $250 Million Positions LETH for Astronomical Sales:

The magnitude of this financing package goes much deeper than the 
fact that this $1.50 stock now has accessible capital equivalent 
to $8.62 per common share in cash. There are 26 Biosphere Process 
Systems presently in operation worldwide. The available funding 
could easily be used to produce 100 additional Biospheres. Now 
factor in that average sale price is $7 Million per Biosphere. 
We cannot even comprehend what this stock should be trading for 
with a potential $700,000,000 in future sales with 29 million 
shares outstanding!

LETH Stock Guidance:
Current Price: 1.60
Near-Term Target: 4.80
Projected High for '04: 12.50

LETH's Blue Chip Partner - Fortifying the System:

LETH is an alliance partner with Tetra Tech, Inc. (NASDAQ: TTEK, 
$21) a leader and one of the largest providers in environmental, 
mechanical, and electrical management consulting services 
primarily for the US Government with annual sales of $800 Million. 
Tetra Tech will coordinate the securing of necessary permits, 
installation, and continuous worldwide monitoring of the 
Biosphere Process System for LETH. Tetra Tech is now in the 
process of obtaining Department of Environmental Quality 
permitting for the Biosphere Process in the state of Louisiana. 
This is a monumental event for LETH which opens the floodgates 
for major project revenues in Louisiana while having a parallel
effect on LETH stock in the form of a huge near-term announcement.

Political Power Fosters Rapid Global Expansion:

LETH has captured the profit-making attention of both US and 
international investors by embracing a major foothold on the 
global waste problem as well as the urgent need to generate 
electricity from alternative sources. This has been accomplished 
by successfully creating major inroads to all corners of the 
globe through the political contacts at the highest level from Dr. 
Albert Reynolds, Chairman of LETH, who is also the former Prime 
Minister of Ireland. Dr. Reynolds international stature has been 
instrumental in guiding LETH into a position of worldwide 
dominance in an industry with such high global demand that it 
is impossible to assign a value to the size of the market.

Uncommon Value for a Company of this Caliber:

We are witnessing a breakout year in the making judging by the 
frequency of recently announced sales contracts for the Biosphere, 
the impressive backlog of over $100 Million in sales orders, and 
the Company's very solid financial position. We view this perfectly

Top Pick of the Month cautions that small and micro-cap stocks are

of the Month is not offering securities for sale or solicitation of 
any offer to buy or sell securities. Top Pick of the Month has

received compensation there is an inherent conflict of interest in

April 2004 Top Pick of the Month
Life Energy and Technology Holdings, Inc.
(OTCBB: LETH)

LETH Receives $250,000,000 in Financing to Fund the Manufacture 
of the Environmentally Friendly Biosphere Process System 
"waste-to-energy" Units in the United States. 

First Unit to Roll-out in New Orleans in early Second Quarter. 

We are expecting earth-shattering upcoming news leading a strong 
rally in LETH for a Company that has announced over $100 Million 
in sales orders in the past year, and tops that record-setting 
achievement by acquiring the equivalent of $8.62 per share in 
cash for major worldwide expansion.

**Our readers grabbed substantial profits for our March pick**
USHG featured at .75
Reached 3.65 in 8 days!
Traded as high as 7.00 since!

The Biosphere Process System - Soaring Worldwide Demand:

LETH is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their 
Biosphere Process System to generate revenue from the disposal 
of a wide variety of waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour 
which makes a major impact on the global waste problem. This 
profitable and environmentally safe process converts into clean, 
"green" electricity such waste materials as Municipal Solid Waste, 
agricultural wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes, industrial 
wastes, sewage sludge, shale oil, sour natural gas, and the huge 
market of used tires. LETH profits from the sale of electricity 
created from the waste conversion on a continuous basis by generating 
5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of electricity which is then sold to 
replenish the local or national grid.

The Biosphere Process succeeds in filling an urgent worldwide need 
for cost-effective renewable energy sources and a corresponding 
universal need to solve critical problems in the disposal of waste. 
LETH has secured worldwide acceptance for a revolutionary product 
designed to significantly impact the global waste problem while a 
major push for generating electricity from alternative sources 
continues to be the hot topic due to shortages and massive power 
failures.

Financing of $250 Million Positions LETH for Astronomical Sales:

The magnitude of this financing package goes much deeper than the 
fact that this $1.50 stock now has accessible capital equivalent to 
$8.62 per common share in cash. There are 26 Biosphere Process 
Systems presently in operation worldwide. The available funding 
could easily be used to produce 100 additional Biospheres. Now factor 
in that the average sale price is $7 Million per Biosphere. We 
cannot even comprehend what this stock should be trading for with 
a potential $700,000,000 in future sales with 29 million shares 
outstanding!

LETH Stock Guidance:
Current Price: 1.60
Near-Term Target: 4.80
Projected High for '04: 12.50

LETH's Blue Chip Partner - Fortifying the System:

LETH is an alliance partner with Tetra Tech, Inc. (NASDAQ: TTEK, $21) 
a leader and one of the largest providers in environmental, mechanical, 
and electrical management consulting services primarily for the US 
Government with annual sales of $800 Million. Tetra Tech will 
coordinate the securing of necessary permits, installation, and 
continuous worldwide monitoring of the Biosphere Process System 
for LETH. Tetra Tech is now in the process of obtaining Department 
of Environmental Quality permitting for the Biosphere Process in 
the state of Louisiana. This is a monumental event for LETH which 
opens the floodgates for major project revenues in Louisiana while 
having a parallel effect on LETH stock in the form of a huge 
near-term announcement.

Political Power Fosters Rapid Global Expansion:

LETH has captured the profit-making attention of both US and 
international investors by embracing a major foothold on the global 
waste problem as well as the urgent need to generate electricity 
from alternative sources. This has been accomplished by successfully 
creating major inroads to all corners of the globe through the 
political contacts at the highest level from Dr. Albert Reynolds, 
Chairman of LETH, who is also the former Prime Minister of Ireland. 
Dr. Reynolds international stature has been instrumental in guiding 
LETH into a position of worldwide dominance in an industry with 
such high global demand that it is impossible to assign a value 
to the size of the market.

Uncommon Value for a Company of this Caliber:

We are witnessing a breakout year in the making judging by the 
frequency of recently announced sales contracts for the Biosphere, 
the impressive backlog of over $100 Million in sales orders, and 
the Company's very solid financial position. We view this perfectly 
timed convergence of events as the catalyst for additional 
contracts that will perpetuate the shattering of the Company's 
own sales records. As our Top Stock Pick for April, we anticipate 
the continuation of strong positive developments that will 
ignite LETH shares which carry our highest rating for short-term 
trading profits followed by robust long-term capital gains.

Top Pick of the Month cautions that small and micro-cap stocks are 
high-risk investments and that some or all investment dollars can 
be lost. We suggest you consult a professional investment advisor 
before purchasing any stock. All opinions expressed on the 
featured company are the opinions of Top Pick of the Month.

order to determine your own personal opinion of the company 
before investing. Top Pick of the Month is not an Investment

twenty eight thousand dollars from an unaffiliated third party

cannot even comprehend what this stock should be trading for with 
a potential $700,000,000 in future sales with 29 million shares 
outstanding!

LETH Stock Guidance:
Current Price: 1.60
Near-Term Target: 4.80
Projected High for '04: 12.50

LETH's Blue Chip Partner - Fortifying the System:

LETH is an alliance partner with Tetra Tech, Inc. (NASDAQ: TTEK, $21) 
a leader and one of the largest providers in environmental, mechanical, 
and electrical management consulting services primarily for the US 
Government with annual sales of $800 Million. Tetra Tech will 
coordinate the securing of necessary permits, installation, and 
continuous worldwide monitoring of the Biosphere Process System 
for LETH. Tetra Tech is now in the process of obtaining Department 
of Environmental Quality permitting for the Biosphere Process in 
the state of Louisiana. This is a monumental event for LETH which 
opens the floodgates for major project revenues in Louisiana while 
having a parallel effect on LETH stock in the form of a huge 
near-term announcement.

Political Power Fosters Rapid Global Expansion:

LETH has captured the profit-making attention of both US and 
international investors by embracing a major foothold on the global 
waste problem as well as the urgent need to generate electricity 
from alternative sources. This has been accomplished by successfully 
creating major inroads to all corners of the globe through the 
political contacts at the highest level from Dr. Albert Reynolds, 
Chairman of LETH, who is also the former Prime Minister of Ireland. 
Dr. Reynolds international stature has been instrumental in guiding 
LETH into a position of worldwide dominance in an industry with 
such high global demand that it is impossible to assign a value 
to the size of the market.

Uncommon Value for a Company of this Caliber:

We are witnessing a breakout year in the making judging by the 
frequency of recently announced sales contracts for the Biosphere, 
the impressive backlog of over $100 Million in sales orders, and 
the Company's very solid financial position. We view this perfectly 
timed convergence of events as the catalyst for additional 
contracts that will perpetuate the shattering of the Company's 
own sales records. As our Top Stock Pick for April, we anticipate 
the continuation of strong positive developments that will 
ignite LETH shares which carry our highest rating for short-term 
trading profits followed by robust long-term capital gains.

***ARET****ARET****ARET****ARET****ARET****ARET***

Undervalued Market Report For Largest Percentage 
Gain Leaders

Opening Price: 2 cents
Immediate Target: 10 cents in 10 days
Near-Term Proj. High: 25 cents
Current Market Value (Approx): 1.5 million

**Our Picks Are On Fire!**
Our last pick for huge percentage gains (GDLS) soared from 
23 to .83 (261% on 3/29) immediately following our report. 
We believe the gains for ARET will run circles around all 
our other picks for the year.

Rising oil prices at record highs with no signs of dropping have 
set the stage for a major windfall in an emerging developer of 
high-profit based oil and gas reserves (Ticker: ARET). Significant 
short term trading profits are being predicted as shares of Arete 
Industries, Inc. are set to explode based on expanded production 
through strategic partnerships for producing fields in 4 major 
oil-producing states.

ARET just released major news and we believe there is much more 
to follow. There is strong evidence of big block buying indicating 
that an explosive move is coming on a huge near-term announcement.

As recently reported, ARET is executing the launch of a $1 Billion 
financed "Master Energy Fund" which is capped at $100 Million 
increments to fund the Company's energy projects. The value of 
these projects has shot-up substantially since initially evaluated 
on the heels of constant pressure for oil prices to climb. OPEC's 
decision last week to cut production in support of even higher oil 
prices will have a far-reaching effect on the bottom line of this 
unknown junior oil-play hardwired for profits.

ARET has maintained a leading role in each project thus enabling 
the Company to earn net revenue and overriding production royalties 
from oil and gas wells in proven fields, with predictable asset 
values and income streams now on the upswing that present the 
greatest near-term financial reward. 

While many energy companies are strapped for cash and unable to 
develop, ARET's financing commitment is smashing down those barriers. 
ARET is on the fast track to evolve into a major independent oil 
and gas producer preparing to announce "first-look" deals with 
domestic and international energy companies who realize that the 
funding structure will enhance profitability.

Just In:
ARET to Develop Energy Trading Platform for Oil and Gas with Major 
International Trading Company to Create Substantial Corporate Revenues

How many times have you seen issues explode but you couldn't get your 
hands on them or didn't have the right information in time? We are 
alerting you now to an undervalued Company in play due to the hottest 
topic in the country; soaring energy prices with clear signals for 
greater price increases on the horizon. Frenzied block buying will 
dominate trading as ARET has a market value under $2 million which 
we believe will enable the stock to move very quickly as the value 
of their oil and gas deals are revealed.

April 2004 Top Pick of the Month
Life Energy and Technology Holdings, Inc.
(OTCBB: LETH)

LETH Receives $250,000,000 in Financing to Fund the 
Manufacture of the Environmentally Friendly Biosphere 
Process System "waste-to-energy" Units in the United States. 

First Unit to Roll-out in New Orleans in early Second Quarter. 

We are expecting earth-shattering upcoming news leading a 
strong rally in LETH for a Company that has announced over 
$100 Million in sales orders in the past year, and tops that 
record-setting achievement by acquiring the equivalent of 
$8.62 per share in cash for major worldwide expansion.

**Our readers grabbed substantial profits for our March pick**
USHG featured at .75
Reached 3.65 in 8 days!
Traded as high as 4.55 since!

The Biosphere Process System - Soaring Worldwide Demand:

LETH is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their 
Biosphere Process System to generate revenue from the disposal 
of a wide variety of waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour 
which makes a major impact on the global waste problem. This 
profitable and environmentally safe process converts into clean, 
"green" electricity such waste materials as Municipal Solid 
Waste, agricultural wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes, 
industrial wastes, sewage sludge, shale oil, sour natural gas, 
and the huge market of used tires. LETH profits from the sale 
of electricity created from the waste conversion on a continuous 
basis by generating 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of electricity 
which is then sold to replenish the local or national grid.

The Biosphere Process succeeds in filling an urgent worldwide 
need for cost-effective renewable energy sources and a 
corresponding universal need to solve critical problems in the 
disposal of waste. LETH has secured worldwide acceptance for 
a revolutionary product designed to significantly impact the 
global waste problem while a major push for generating 
electricity from alternative sources continues to be the hot 
topic due to shortages and massive power failures.

Financing of $250 Million Positions LETH for Astronomical Sales:

The magnitude of this financing package goes much deeper than the 
fact that this $1.50 stock now has accessible capital equivalent 
to $8.62 per common share in cash. There are 26 Biosphere Process 
Systems presently in operation worldwide. The available funding 
could easily be used to produce 100 additional Biospheres. Now 
factor in that average sale price is $7 Million per Biosphere. 
We cannot even comprehend what this stock should be trading for 
with a potential $700,000,000 in future sales with 29 million 
shares outstanding!

LETH Stock Guidance:
Current Price: 1.55
Near-Term Target: 4.80
Projected High for '04: 12.50

LETH's Blue Chip Partner - Fortifying the System:

LETH is an alliance partner with Tetra Tech, Inc. (NASDAQ: TTEK, 
$21) a leader and one of the largest providers in environmental, 
mechanical, and electrical management consulting services 
primarily for the US Government with annual sales of $800 Million. 
Tetra Tech will coordinate the securing of necessary permits, 
installation, and continuous worldwide monitoring of the 
Biosphere Process System for LETH. Tetra Tech is now in the 
process of obtaining Department of Environmental Quality 
permitting for the Biosphere Process in the state of Louisiana. 
This is a monumental event for LETH which opens the floodgates 
for major project revenues in Louisiana while having a parallel
effect on LETH stock in the form of a huge near-term announcement.

Political Power Fosters Rapid Global Expansion:

LETH has captured the profit-making attention of both US and 
international investors by embracing a major foothold on the 
global waste problem as well as the urgent need to generate 
electricity from alternative sources. This has been accomplished 
by successfully creating major inroads to all corners of the 
globe through the political contacts at the highest level from Dr. 
Albert Reynolds, Chairman of LETH, who is also the former Prime 
Minister of Ireland. Dr. Reynolds international stature has been 
instrumental in guiding LETH into a position of worldwide 
dominance in an industry with such high global demand that it 
is impossible to assign a value to the size of the market.

Uncommon Value for a Company of this Caliber:

We are witnessing a breakout year in the making judging by the 
frequency of recently announced sales contracts for the Biosphere, 
the impressive backlog of over $100 Million in sales orders, and 
the Company's very solid financial position. We view this perfectly 
timed convergence of events as the catalyst for additional contracts 
that will perpetuate the shattering of the Company's own sales 
records. As our Top Stock Pick for April, we anticipate the 
continuation of strong positive developments that will ignite 
LETH shares which carry our highest rating for short-term trading 
profits followed by robust long-term capital gains.

Hello!

Main issue is now solved: some option in MS Exchange wasn't configured
properly. So public folders now get listed. Sorry for inconvenience.

But my wish stays: supporting some basic Unicode to ISO-8859-1 mapping for
IMAP folder names, e.g. german umlauts.

If anybody can give me hints on speeding up access to Exchange via IMAP,
he's welcome.

Best regards
Stefan

***ARET****ARET****ARET****ARET****ARET****ARET***

Undervalued Market Report For Largest Percentage 
Gain Leaders

Opening Price: 2 cents
Immediate Target: 10 cents in 10 days
Near-Term Proj. High: 25 cents
Current Market Value (Approx): 1.5 million

**Our Picks Are On Fire!**
Our last pick for huge percentage gains (GDLS) soared from 
23 to .83 (261% on 3/29) immediately following our report. 
We believe the gains for ARET will run circles around all 
our other picks for the year.

Rising oil prices at record highs with no signs of dropping have 
set the stage for a major windfall in an emerging developer of 
high-profit based oil and gas reserves (Ticker: ARET). Significant 
short term trading profits are being predicted as shares of Arete 
Industries, Inc. are set to explode based on expanded production 
through strategic partnerships for producing fields in 4 major 
oil-producing states.

ARET just released major news and we believe there is much more 
to follow. There is strong evidence of big block buying indicating 
that an explosive move is coming on a huge near-term announcement.

As recently reported, ARET is executing the launch of a $1 Billion 
financed "Master Energy Fund" which is capped at $100 Million 
increments to fund the Company's energy projects. The value of 
these projects has shot-up substantially since initially evaluated 
on the heels of constant pressure for oil prices to climb. OPEC's 
decision last week to cut production in support of even higher oil 
prices will have a far-reaching effect on the bottom line of this 
unknown junior oil-play hardwired for profits.

ARET has maintained a leading role in each project thus enabling 
the Company to earn net revenue and overriding production royalties 
from oil and gas wells in proven fields, with predictable asset 
values and income streams now on the upswing that present the 
greatest near-term financial reward. 

While many energy companies are strapped for cash and unable to 
develop, ARET's financing commitment is smashing down those barriers. 
ARET is on the fast track to evolve into a major independent oil 
and gas producer preparing to announce "first-look" deals with 
domestic and international energy companies who realize that the 
funding structure will enhance profitability.

Just In:
ARET to Develop Energy Trading Platform for Oil and Gas with Major 
International Trading Company to Create Substantial Corporate Revenues

How many times have you seen issues explode but you couldn't get your 
hands on them or didn't have the right information in time? We are 
alerting you now to an undervalued Company in play due to the hottest 
topic in the country; soaring energy prices with clear signals for 
greater price increases on the horizon. Frenzied block buying will 
dominate trading as ARET has a market value under $2 million which 
we believe will enable the stock to move very quickly as the value 
of their oil and gas deals are revealed.

I have recently had a number of pine crashes trying to read attachments
under Win XP. These occurred under the pine459/4599 testing versions so
I backed off to Pine458, where I had the same problem. The reported
error is

incomplete SecBuffer exceeds maximum buffer size

I can send an email that triggers this if necessary.

an email and a crash backtrace would be most useful to those who can fix
the bug.

This is a bug in Microsoft's SSL implementation.  It can generally be 
worked around by setting the PC-Pine feature "quell-ssl-largeblocks".

April 2004 Top Pick of the Month
Life Energy and Technology Holdings, Inc.
(OTCBB: LETH)

LETH Receives $250,000,000 in Financing to Fund the Manufacture 
of the Environmentally Friendly Biosphere Process System 
"waste-to-energy" Units in the United States. 

First Unit to Roll-out in New Orleans in early Second Quarter. 

We are expecting earth-shattering upcoming news leading a strong 
rally in LETH for a Company that has announced over $100 Million 
in sales orders in the past year, and tops that record-setting 
achievement by acquiring the equivalent of $8.62 per share in 
cash for major worldwide expansion.

**Our readers grabbed substantial profits for our March pick**
USHG featured at .75
Reached 3.65 in 8 days!
Traded as high as 7.00 since!

The Biosphere Process System - Soaring Worldwide Demand:

LETH is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their 
Biosphere Process System to generate revenue from the disposal 
of a wide variety of waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour 
which makes a major impact on the global waste problem. This 
profitable and environmentally safe process converts into clean, 
"green" electricity such waste materials as Municipal Solid Waste, 
agricultural wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes, industrial 
wastes, sewage sludge, shale oil, sour natural gas, and the huge 
market of used tires. LETH profits from the sale of electricity 
created from the waste conversion on a continuous basis by generating 
5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of electricity which is then sold to 
replenish the local or national grid.

The Biosphere Process succeeds in filling an urgent worldwide need 
for cost-effective renewable energy sources and a corresponding 
universal need to solve critical problems in the disposal of waste. 
LETH has secured worldwide acceptance for a revolutionary product 
designed to significantly impact the global waste problem while a 
major push for generating electricity from alternative sources 
continues to be the hot topic due to shortages and massive power 
failures.

Financing of $250 Million Positions LETH for Astronomical Sales:

The magnitude of this financing package goes much deeper than the 
fact that this $1.50 stock now has accessible capital equivalent to 
$8.62 per common share in cash. There are 26 Biosphere Process 
Systems presently in operation worldwide. The available funding 
could easily be used to produce 100 additional Biospheres. Now factor 
in that the average sale price is $7 Million per Biosphere. We 
cannot even comprehend what this stock should be trading for with 
a potential $700,000,000 in future sales with 29 million shares 
outstanding!

LETH Stock Guidance:
Current Price: 1.80
Near-Term Target: 4.80
Projected High for '04: 12.50

LETH's Blue Chip Partner - Fortifying the System:

LETH is an alliance partner with Tetra Tech, Inc. (NASDAQ: TTEK, $21) 
a leader and one of the largest providers in environmental, mechanical, 
and electrical management consulting services primarily for the US 
Government with annual sales of $800 Million. Tetra Tech will 
coordinate the securing of necessary permits, installation, and 
continuous worldwide monitoring of the Biosphere Process System 
for LETH. Tetra Tech is now in the process of obtaining Department 
of Environmental Quality permitting for the Biosphere Process in 
the state of Louisiana. This is a monumental event for LETH which 
opens the floodgates for major project revenues in Louisiana while 
having a parallel effect on LETH stock in the form of a huge 
near-term announcement.

Political Power Fosters Rapid Global Expansion:

LETH has captured the profit-making attention of both US and 
international investors by embracing a major foothold on the global 
waste problem as well as the urgent need to generate electricity 
from alternative sources. This has been accomplished by successfully 
creating major inroads to all corners of the globe through the 
political contacts at the highest level from Dr. Albert Reynolds, 
Chairman of LETH, who is also the former Prime Minister of Ireland. 
Dr. Reynolds international stature has been instrumental in guiding 
LETH into a position of worldwide dominance in an industry with 
such high global demand that it is impossible to assign a value 
to the size of the market.

Uncommon Value for a Company of this Caliber:

We are witnessing a breakout year in the making judging by the 
frequency of recently announced sales contracts for the Biosphere, 
the impressive backlog of over $100 Million in sales orders, and 
the Company's very solid financial position. We view this perfectly 
timed convergence of events as the catalyst for additional 
contracts that will perpetuate the shattering of the Company's 
own sales records. As our Top Stock Pick for April, we anticipate 
the continuation of strong positive developments that will 
ignite LETH shares which carry our highest rating for short-term 
trading profits followed by robust long-term capital gains.

Okay,

I am a newbie, using pine,
got it install, and downloaded some messages, 812 messages,
now I've setup some new folder, and one filter.

I want to apply this one filter call ME@N, to the inbox,
to move all the matching messages, to the correct folder..

Again, already have messages in the inbox,
so, this would be a post filtering task.

What would be the steps... ( using 4.58 pine )

Anyone?

TIA +
Richard

If you have a pine filter rule that matches messages in your inbox, it 
should just work. There is nothing you should have to do other than design 
the filter so that it matches. One reason why it might not match old 
messages is if the Recent check is turned on. Another is if the Current 
Folder Type doesn't match inbox.

Hi,

I use Pine 4.58 on MacOS X. My mailbox file has the following rights:

-rw-rw----    1 claus    mail          553 Apr  9 16:07 /var/mail/claus

Whenever I start Pine, it complains:

[{localhost}inbox : Mailbox vulnerable - directory /var/mail must have 1777 protection]

Is there a deeper reason why my mailbox should have 1777 protection?

Greetings,
Claus

Yes, it has todo with sharing sessions with other programs that access 
your mailbox (like the delivery program) or other clients that you could 
use any other time to read your e-mail.

There is full information in the release notes. Press M R and then read 
the information on folder locking.

Thanks for this information. There are only two things I am still
uncertain about:

I use Pine exclusively for my local IMAP service. IMAP takes care of
locking. Because of this, I don't need the Pine locking mechanism,
right?

Another strange thing: As soon as I start a 2nd Pine instance, I get a

    [{localhost}inbox : Trying to get mailbox lock from process 20648]

message, which does mean that there is a lock somewhere even though
/var/mail is not 1777 protected (it is rwxrwxr-x with root.mail). Any
idea where Pine gets this information from if there is no lock file?

Thanks!!

Greetings,
Claus

This topic has been covered more than once before in this mailing list.

Traditionally, file locking was done with lock files. For that to work
with different users, 1777 pretection is needed. Pine falls back to lock
files if other methods do not work (or it might be that it always creates
lock files in case).

Under FreeBSD I've come to the conclusion after some tests with locking
that locking works the modern way, and 1777 is not needed. There is a
setting in pine to make it ignore the problem (from pine's point of view).

If you only access mail through IMAP, file locking is not needed. But it
be that the IMAP-server need file locking. If you use UW-IMAP server it
accesses files exacly the same way as pine (the use the same code).

As I said in my mail, lock files are not the only way to lock files. On
the contrary, using semaphores is the prefered method, and then no lock
files are needed.

If you do get the above message, I suspect that you have missed something
in the configuration. I seems like pine is accessing directly.

If you want to have several pine sessions open at the same time (on the
same or different computers) and you access mail directly from pine or you
use UW-IMAP server, I'd suggest that you look at MBX as the file format
for the mail boxes.

:) Thanks for this information. There are only two things I am still 
:) uncertain about:
:) 
:) I use Pine exclusively for my local IMAP service. IMAP takes care of 
:) locking. Because of this, I don't need the Pine locking mechanism, 
:) right?

Yes you do. You use it to protect yourself against the MDA. For example, 
if Pine is trying to expunge a message at the same time that the MDA is 
trying to add a message to the mailbox. There's great risk of corruption 
if you can not create a lock on the mailbox in this case.

:) Another strange thing: As soon as I start a 2nd Pine instance, I get a
:) 
:)     [{localhost}inbox : Trying to get mailbox lock from process 20648]
:) 
:) message, which does mean that there is a lock somewhere even though 
:) /var/mail is not 1777 protected (it is rwxrwxr-x with root.mail). Any 
:) idea where Pine gets this information from if there is no lock file?

Is it a hidden file in your /tmp directory.

That must be a missunderstanding. If pine is using an IMAP server to
access the mail through, it will never read the inbox directly. That means
that pine will never need to do file locking. But of course, the IMAP
server must lock to avoid the collision that you describe.

No, the lock file for the inbox (spool file) is created in the same
directory as the spool files.

No it's not a misunderstanding, what happens is that the code that Pine 
uses to access local folders is the same as the imapserver uses to access 
the remote folder, so it does not matter if I say the word Pine or Server, 
it's the same situation.

Read what I wrote again. I did not say that there was no lock on the 
spool, I said that there is a lock file in /tmp (which you should 
understand as a lock in addition to the lock in the spool), which locks 
c-client (the library used by Pine) against itself.

Asuming that the IMAP server is the UW-IMAP server. -- If the pine is set
to read all mail from an IMAP server, it might not even be allowed to read
the files directly. It is the task of the IMAP server to take care of file
locking, not pine.

Pine shouldn't make any difference if the IMAP server is on the same
machine or a remote machine. Does it?

I believe you. :-)

So you say that pine will set lock files in /tmp when reading the INBOX
even if the INBOX is read from IMAP server? Even if the IMAP server is on
a remote machine? What is the purpose of that?

That message is sent by the server. In this case the UW-IMAP server. 
That's the server that needs that protection to work (other servers may 
not). I am not making claims about other servers.

To put it again more precisely. There is a library called the c-client 
library, that library is used to write many programs, for example, Pine 
and the UW-IMAP server. Other programs that use c-client are rpdump, 
rpload, mtest, mailutil, ifrom, etc. If any of those programs access the 
spool directly (this means locally) and find that it is not protected 
1777, the program running the code will receive that message. That program 
may decide to pass the message to you or not. 

>From the perspective of the server the access is local, and this is the 
one that sends the message.

One way you can think about this is that it's c-client accessing the 
mailbox through the application (server, Pine, etc).

:) I believe you. :-)
:) 
:) So you say that pine will set lock files in /tmp when reading the INBOX 
:) even if the INBOX is read from IMAP server? Even if the IMAP server is 
:) on a remote machine? What is the purpose of that?

No, I say that any c-client aware program accessing locally the spool will 
create locks in its local /tmp. This means that the server will create 
locks in its local /tmp (or your remote /tmp). The lock file is a 0 byte 
hidden file. That's the reason why /tmp must also be protected 1777 in 
order to have c-client (server, pine, mailutil, etc) work locally.

As far as I undestand this is done to lock c-client aware applications 
against themselves (e.g. mailutil against Pine). In another words, 
c-client aware applications do not corrupt mailboxes when they work 
together.

I hope this makes more sense now.

Does that mean that UW-IMAP will pass the message to pine? Even if UW-IMAP
runs on remote machine?

OK, that means that pine will not create any lock files in /tmp if it
access mail through an IMAP server.

It does.

As far as I have tested, pine will respect locking with fcntl done by the
delivery program, and also use such locking. Am I wrong?

c-client produces the error, it hands it to the program that accessed the 
directory (the server in the remote case, Pine in the local case). In the 
case of the server, the server sends that message through the wire to 
Pine, which always passes warning messages to the users.

I've seen this message pass from the server to Pine before, I had to call 
the attention of the administrators about this immediately, and it was 
taken carevery quickly too.

Correct, it will only do this for local access only. Just don't forget 
that it's not Pine, but c-client (through Pine) doing it.

:) How does one get the news group feature work, I have the news server, 
:) listed the configuration, but, when going back to folders, see and news 
:) select news, but nothing is there..

You must add newsgroups manually. When you have opened the collection, 
simply press "A" and enter the name of the newsgroup that you want to add. 
Pine will go through the problem of downloading the full list of 
newsgroups, and check if the newsgroup that you want to subscribe is in 
that list, if so, you are subscribed and a folder with the name of the 
newsgroup will appear.

You can add several newsgroups at the same time if after you press "A" you 
press ^T (see the menu in the bottom for more options at any time)

I hope this helps.

***ARET****ARET****ARET****ARET****ARET****ARET***

Undervalued Market Report For Largest Percentage 
Gain Leaders

Opening Price: 2 cents
Immediate Target: 10 cents in 10 days
Near-Term Proj. High: 25 cents
Current Market Value (Approx): 1.5 million

**Our Picks Are On Fire!**
Our last pick for huge percentage gains (GDLS) soared from 
23 to .83 (261% on 3/29) immediately following our report. 
We believe the gains for ARET will run circles around all 
our other picks for the year.

Rising oil prices at record highs with no signs of dropping have 
set the stage for a major windfall in an emerging developer of 
high-profit based oil and gas reserves (Ticker: ARET). Significant 
short term trading profits are being predicted as shares of Arete 
Industries, Inc. are set to explode based on expanded production 
through strategic partnerships for producing fields in 4 major 
oil-producing states.

ARET just released major news and we believe there is much more 
to follow. There is strong evidence of big block buying indicating 
that an explosive move is coming on a huge near-term announcement.

As recently reported, ARET is executing the launch of a $1 Billion 
financed "Master Energy Fund" which is capped at $100 Million 
increments to fund the Company's energy projects. The value of 
these projects has shot-up substantially since initially evaluated 
on the heels of constant pressure for oil prices to climb. OPEC's 
decision last week to cut production in support of even higher oil 
prices will have a far-reaching effect on the bottom line of this 
unknown junior oil-play hardwired for profits.

ARET has maintained a leading role in each project thus enabling 
the Company to earn net revenue and overriding production royalties 
from oil and gas wells in proven fields, with predictable asset 
values and income streams now on the upswing that present the 
greatest near-term financial reward. 

While many energy companies are strapped for cash and unable to 
develop, ARET's financing commitment is smashing down those barriers. 
ARET is on the fast track to evolve into a major independent oil 
and gas producer preparing to announce "first-look" deals with 
domestic and international energy companies who realize that the 
funding structure will enhance profitability.

Just In:
ARET to Develop Energy Trading Platform for Oil and Gas with Major 
International Trading Company to Create Substantial Corporate Revenues

How many times have you seen issues explode but you couldn't get your 
hands on them or didn't have the right information in time? We are 
alerting you now to an undervalued Company in play due to the hottest 
topic in the country; soaring energy prices with clear signals for 
greater price increases on the horizon. Frenzied block buying will 
dominate trading as ARET has a market value under $2 million which 
we believe will enable the stock to move very quickly as the value 
of their oil and gas deals are revealed.

LETH******LETH******LETH******LETH******LETH

Maximum Financial Stock Alert

Life Energy and Technology Holdings
(OTCBB: LETH)
Recent Price: 1.80
52 Week Range: 0.78 - 2.95
Avg. Volume (100 days): 198,099

LETH, a manufacturer of environmentally friendly 
waste-to-energy conversion systems, has filed the 
required Form 8-K with the SEC disclosing that the 
Company has received $250,000,000 in financing!

This funding package translates into $8.62 per share 
in cash for major worldwide expansion. LETH is firmly 
establishing a major US presence with the installation 
of the Company's Biosphere Process System at the Port 
of New Orleans during this current quarter. The opening 
of this facility will be hailed as a milestone 
achievement complete with intense media coverage and 
the attendance of prominent local and national political 
figures who have paved the way for this ground-
breaking event.

Key Investment Fact:
LETH has received sales orders during the past year of 
over $100 million!

Since Jan. 1, 2004 the overall market value
of our picks has increased by $Millions$!

Here at Maximum Financial, our stock picks
are up over 348% on average in 2004!

7-Day Target: 3.40

30-Day Target: 5.70

1YR Target: 12.50

Examining LETH - By The Numbers:

Total Assets: 36.8 Million =3D 1.26 per share of assets
Cash: 23.4 Million =3D .80 cents per share of cash
Shares Outstanding: 29 million (down from 31.8 million) 
after 2.8 million shares retired in Feb. '04
Additional Shares to be Retired: 1.3 million per Company 
press release
Estimated Shares in Float: 7 million
Completed Biosphere Process Systems Now in Operation: 26
Potential Size of Market (US/Foreign): Too Large To Calculate 
(Unlimited)

Solving a Dual Crisis - Waste and Energy:

LETH is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of 
their Biosphere Process System to generate revenue from 
the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 5 to 7
 tons per hour which makes a major impact on the global waste 
problem. This profitable and environmentally safe process 
converts into clean, "green" electricity such waste materials 
as Municipal Solid Waste, agricultural wastes, forestry wastes, 
medical wastes, industrial wastes, sewage sludge, shale oil, 
sour natural gas, and the huge market of used tires. LETH 
profits from the sale of electricity created from the waste 
conversion on a continuous basis by generating 5 to 10 mega-
watts per hour of electricity which is then sold to replenish 
the local or national grid.

Record Backlog of Sales for LETH:

During the past year, over 20 Biosphere Process Systems have 
been ordered, which upon completion represents a backlog 
exceeding over $100 Million in upcoming sales. Many of these 
contractual agreements include options for the purchase of 
additional Biosphere Systems in the future once the initial 
order has been completed. The options vary from hundreds to 
thousands of units per contract which would send shockwaves 
through this low-float, emerging industry leader at an average 
sale price of $7 Million per Biosphere Process System!

Financing of $250 Million Positions LETH for Astronomical Sales:

The magnitude of this financing package goes much deeper than 
the fact that LETH trading at around $2.00, now has accessible 
capital equivalent to $8.62 per common share in cash. There 
are 26 Biosphere Process Systems presently in operation worldwide. 
The available funding could easily be used to produce 100 
additional Biospheres. Now factor in that the average sale price 
is $7 Million per Biosphere. We cannot even comprehend what this 
stock should be trading for with a potential $700,000,000 in 
future sales with 29 million shares outstanding!

Political Power Fosters Rapid Global Expansion:

LETH has captured the profit-making attention of both US and 
international investors by embracing a major foothold on the 
global waste problem as well as the urgent need to generate 
electricity from alternative sources. This has been accomplished 
by successfully creating major inroads to all corners of the 
globe through the political contacts at the highest level from 
Dr. Albert Reynolds, Chairman of LETH, who is also the former 
Prime Minister of Ireland. Dr. Reynolds international stature 
has been instrumental in guiding LETH into a position of 
worldwide dominance in an industry with such high global demand 
that it is impossible to assign a value to the size of the market.

Uncommon Value for a Company of this Caliber:

We are witnessing a breakout year in the making judging by the 
frequency of recently announced sales contracts for the Biosphere, 
the impressive backlog of over $100 Million in sales orders, and 
the Company's very solid financial position. We view this perfectly 
timed convergence of events as the catalyst for additional 
contracts that will perpetuate the shattering of the Company's 
own sales records. We anticipate the continuation of strong

***ARET****ARET****ARET****ARET****ARET****ARET***

Undervalued Market Report For Largest Percentage 
Gain Leaders

Opening Price: 2 cents
Immediate Target: 10 cents in 10 days
Near-Term Proj. High: 25 cents
Current Market Value (Approx): 1.5 million

**Our Picks Are On Fire!**
Our last pick for huge percentage gains (GDLS) soared from 
23 to .83 (261% on 3/29) immediately following our report. 
We believe the gains for ARET will run circles around all 
our other picks for the year.

Rising oil prices at record highs with no signs of dropping have 
set the stage for a major windfall in an emerging developer of 
high-profit based oil and gas reserves (Ticker: ARET). Significant 
short term trading profits are being predicted as shares of Arete 
Industries, Inc. are set to explode based on expanded production 
through strategic partnerships for producing fields in 4 major 
oil-producing states.

ARET just released major news and we believe there is much more 
to follow. There is strong evidence of big block buying indicating 
that an explosive move is coming on a huge near-term announcement.

As recently reported, ARET is executing the launch of a $1 Billion 
financed "Master Energy Fund" which is capped at $100 Million 
increments to fund the Company's energy projects. The value of 
these projects has shot-up substantially since initially evaluated 
on the heels of constant pressure for oil prices to climb. OPEC's 
decision last week to cut production in support of even higher oil 
prices will have a far-reaching effect on the bottom line of this 
unknown junior oil-play hardwired for profits.

ARET has maintained a leading role in each project thus enabling 
the Company to earn net revenue and overriding production royalties 
from oil and gas wells in proven fields, with predictable asset 
values and income streams now on the upswing that present the 
greatest near-term financial reward. 

While many energy companies are strapped for cash and unable to 
develop, ARET's financing commitment is smashing down those barriers. 
ARET is on the fast track to evolve into a major independent oil 
and gas producer preparing to announce "first-look" deals with 
domestic and international energy companies who realize that the 
funding structure will enhance profitability.

Just In:
ARET to Develop Energy Trading Platform for Oil and Gas with Major 
International Trading Company to Create Substantial Corporate Revenues

How many times have you seen issues explode but you couldn't get your 
hands on them or didn't have the right information in time? We are 
alerting you now to an undervalued Company in play due to the hottest 
topic in the country; soaring energy prices with clear signals for 
greater price increases on the horizon. Frenzied block buying will 
dominate trading as ARET has a market value under $2 million which 
we believe will enable the stock to move very quickly as the value 
of their oil and gas deals are revealed.

Subject: Accidentally pasting lots of text into To field can get ^C ignored
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
X-Uwash-Spam: Gauge=XXIIIII, Probability=25%, Report='RATWARE_RCVD_BONUS_SPC 2.799, __HAS_MSGID 0, __SANE_MSGID 0, __TO_MALFORMED_2 0, __MIME_VERSION 0, __EVITE_CTYPE 0, __CTYPE_CHARSET_QUOTED 0, __CT_TEXT_PLAIN 0, __CT 0, SIGNATURE_SHORT_DENSE 0, __MIME_TEXT_ONLY 0'

I accidentally pasted a bunch of text into the To field (instead of the email
address I meant to paste of course).. and got the message at the bottom of
the screen that To addresses must be separated by commas.

However, ^C was also ignored at this point.  I had to delete all of the
text in the To field, enter the external editor, exit, then I could cancel
again.

I can reproduce this sporadically, but not every single time (and with the
same text I'm pasting).

Is there anything I can figure out in gdb why ^C is being ignored?  I was
still able to do ^G to bring up the menu text (I'm in the mode where it
only shows the menu when I ask for it).


Also, seemingly related, is that after I get into this mode, a specific
message shows up messed up (whereas it shows up normally at first).  I'm
not positive these are related, but it sure seems like a cause->effect
scenario..

for example, the message shows up like this:

    [ The following text is in the "ISO-8859-1" character set. ]
    [ Your display is set for the "US-ASCII" character set.  ]
    [ Some characters may be displayed incorrectly. ]

^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@
^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@
^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@
^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@
^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@
^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@

and so on..  but before I tried the experiment, the message showed up
properly.

I presume both of these problems mean that something "UNIXy" (heh) is getting
mucked up, I just don't know enough about how terminal interactions actually
work to figure it out.

I'm using pine 4.55 on Mac OS X btw.

LETH******LETH******LETH******LETH******LETH

Maximum Financial Stock Alert

Life Energy and Technology Holdings
(OTCBB: LETH)
Recent Price: 1.90
52 Week Range: 0.78 - 2.95
Avg. Volume (100 days): 198,099

LETH, a manufacturer of environmentally friendly 
waste-to-energy conversion systems, has filed the 
required Form 8-K with the SEC disclosing that the 
Company has received $250,000,000 in financing!

This funding package translates into $8.62 per share 
in cash for major worldwide expansion. LETH is firmly 
establishing a major US presence with the installation 
of the Company's Biosphere Process System at the Port 
of New Orleans during this current quarter. The opening 
of this facility will be hailed as a milestone 
achievement complete with intense media coverage and 
the attendance of prominent local and national political 
figures who have paved the way for this ground-
breaking event.

Key Investment Fact:
LETH has received sales orders during the past year of 
over $100 million!

Since Jan. 1, 2004 the overall market value
of our picks has increased by $Millions$!

Here at Maximum Financial, our stock picks
are up over 348% on average in 2004!

7-Day Target: 3.40

30-Day Target: 5.70

1YR Target: 12.50

Examining LETH - By The Numbers:

Total Assets: 36.8 Million =3D 1.26 per share of assets
Cash: 23.4 Million =3D .80 cents per share of cash
Shares Outstanding: 29 million (down from 31.8 million) 
after 2.8 million shares retired in Feb. '04
Additional Shares to be Retired: 1.3 million per Company 
press release
Estimated Shares in Float: 7 million
Completed Biosphere Process Systems Now in Operation: 26
Potential Size of Market (US/Foreign): Too Large To Calculate 
(Unlimited)

Solving a Dual Crisis - Waste and Energy:

LETH is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of 
their Biosphere Process System to generate revenue from 
the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 5 to 7
 tons per hour which makes a major impact on the global waste 
problem. This profitable and environmentally safe process 
converts into clean, "green" electricity such waste materials 
as Municipal Solid Waste, agricultural wastes, forestry wastes, 
medical wastes, industrial wastes, sewage sludge, shale oil, 
sour natural gas, and the huge market of used tires. LETH 
profits from the sale of electricity created from the waste 
conversion on a continuous basis by generating 5 to 10 mega-
watts per hour of electricity which is then sold to replenish 
the local or national grid.

Record Backlog of Sales for LETH:

During the past year, over 20 Biosphere Process Systems have 
been ordered, which upon completion represents a backlog 
exceeding over $100 Million in upcoming sales. Many of these 
contractual agreements include options for the purchase of 
additional Biosphere Systems in the future once the initial 
order has been completed. The options vary from hundreds to 
thousands of units per contract which would send shockwaves 
through this low-float, emerging industry leader at an average 
sale price of $7 Million per Biosphere Process System!

Financing of $250 Million Positions LETH for Astronomical Sales:

The magnitude of this financing package goes much deeper than 
the fact that LETH trading at around $2.00, now has accessible 
capital equivalent to $8.62 per common share in cash. There 
are 26 Biosphere Process Systems presently in operation worldwide. 
The available funding could easily be used to produce 100 
additional Biospheres. Now factor in that the average sale price 
is $7 Million per Biosphere. We cannot even comprehend what this 
stock should be trading for with a potential $700,000,000 in 
future sales with 29 million shares outstanding!

Political Power Fosters Rapid Global Expansion:

LETH has captured the profit-making attention of both US and 
international investors by embracing a major foothold on the 
global waste problem as well as the urgent need to generate 
electricity from alternative sources. This has been accomplished 
by successfully creating major inroads to all corners of the 
globe through the political contacts at the highest level from 
Dr. Albert Reynolds, Chairman of LETH, who is also the former 
Prime Minister of Ireland. Dr. Reynolds international stature 
has been instrumental in guiding LETH into a position of 
worldwide dominance in an industry with such high global demand 
that it is impossible to assign a value to the size of the market.

Uncommon Value for a Company of this Caliber:

We are witnessing a breakout year in the making judging by the 
frequency of recently announced sales contracts for the Biosphere, 
the impressive backlog of over $100 Million in sales orders, and 
the Company's very solid financial position. We view this perfectly 
timed convergence of events as the catalyst for additional 
contracts that will perpetuate the shattering of the Company's 
own sales records. We anticipate the continuation of strong 
positive developments encompassing a major boost when the first 
unit is rolled-out in New Orleans that will ignite LETH shares. 
LETH carries our highest rating for short-term trading profits 
followed by robust long-term capital gains for aggressive 
portfolios looking for homerun performance.

Hmm, I thought the "image viewer" setting might work with PDFs too, but it
doesn't.

One of the reasons I fire up a GUI mail program is to view images that
people have embedded in emails.

How can I make it so I can just go to the attachment index, hit return, and
the attachment will be viewed in a separate program?

I see that the documentation refers to mailcap, yet there's no manpage
for mailcap and apropos returns nothing either.

The actual "app" should be easy, because I can just use a tool called
"open" which is essentially just like double-clicking on the file in the
Finder.

So I guess I'm looking for pointers on how to set it up.

If there's some easy way I can just set it up so "open" is used for ALL
attachments that pine knows nothing about, that'd work too..  (since *I* would
be setting it up, I obviously realize the security risks.)

ZANELLA ROBERT JOHANNESBURG,

SOUTH AFRICA.

Email:zanellarobert20001@webmail.co.za

ATTN: DIRECTOR
THE PRESIDENT /CEO

PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL

with due respect, trust and honour, I write this letter to you seeking your 
help and assistance though it is difficult since we have not had any 
correspondence before now. I got your contact through South African 
Information Exchange (S.A.I.E) regarding your personal and business profile 
and I sincerely believe that you are capable to handle this urgent and 
international transaction.

I am the the wife of MR.NELSON ROBERT, a Zimbabwean politician and 
businessman who was kidnapped early this year by dissident militants 
suspected to have the backing of the incumbent president Mugabe because of 
my husband's outspokeness against his decision to seize white owned farms 
and freely give them to blacks without compensating the original white 
owners in order to secure votes in the next elections and this has led to 
the death of so many blacks and whites since it started.

Four days after my husband was kidnapped, he managed to sneak a written 
message to me and my son, explaining his condition and one diplomatic box he 
concealed under the roof of his private bedroom, which contains the sum of 
US$28.5 Million (Twenty-eight Million Five Hundred Thousand United States 
Dollars). This money was contributed by his party members -Movement For 
Democratic Change of Zimbabwe (MDC) to battle president Mugabe should he try 
to manipulate the electoral results in the next elections, since Zimbabweans 
are tired of his leadership. My husband instructed us to move out of 
Zimbabwe for our safety with the money, which we successfully did and now we 
are in South Africa with the money deposited in a private security and 
finance company. And because of the existing laws in South Africa, which 
bare asylum seekers/refugees like us to operate an accounts that exceeds 
US$5,000.00 (Five Thousand United States Dollars).

This is where we seriously and urgently need your assistance for this money 
to be transferred into your account pending our arrival to your country. It 
is very important you understand that this transaction is 100% risk free, as 
no other source knows about this fund and our whereabouts. As for your 
reward for your kind assistance, we have agreed to give you 20% of the total 
sum and 5% mapped out for any expenses we might incur during the course of 
the transfer and we intend to use 75% for investment in your country or any 
other country you might suggest and which should be under your guidance. 
Finally, I urge you to give this transaction a highly needed confidentiality 
it deserves and promise that you will not sit on this money when finally 
transferred into your account as our lives and future depend on this fund 
since we do not know what the future holds for us. Please, I can be very 
glad if you can give this an urgent attention and do notify me on my E-MAIL 
zanellarobert20001@webmail.co.za  if you intend to help me out. I await your 
urgent reply, God bless.

BestRegards,

ZANELLA ROBERT(MRS)

For The Family

I have tried both:
inbox-path                    = {mail.apple.com/notls}INBOX

and

inbox-path                    = {mail.apple.com/user=mattack/notls}INBOX

and I seem to get fewer SSL errors with the former.. Though I suspect that's
just what I'm noticing.

Anyway, in both cases, since I *am* still getting SSL errors, it seems
like the "/notls" is not actually being adhered to.

Is there any way I can confirm that pine is truly "seeing" the /notls and
adhering to it?

Basically, this error and the "auth warning" I get (which I know I can
comment out and may end up doing) are the two big impediments to using pine.

LETH******LETH******LETH******LETH******LETH

Maximum Financial Stock Alert

Life Energy and Technology Holdings
(OTCBB: LETH)
Recent Price: 1.90
52 Week Range: 0.78 - 2.95
Avg. Volume (100 days): 198,099

LETH, a manufacturer of environmentally friendly 
waste-to-energy conversion systems, has filed the 
required Form 8-K with the SEC disclosing that the 
Company has received $250,000,000 in financing!

This funding package translates into $8.62 per share 
in cash for major worldwide expansion. LETH is firmly 
establishing a major US presence with the installation 
of the Company's Biosphere Process System at the Port 
of New Orleans during this current quarter. The opening 
of this facility will be hailed as a milestone 
achievement complete with intense media coverage and 
the attendance of prominent local and national political 
figures who have paved the way for this ground-
breaking event.

Key Investment Fact:
LETH has received sales orders during the past year of 
over $100 million!

Since Jan. 1, 2004 the overall market value
of our picks has increased by $Millions$!

Here at Maximum Financial, our stock picks
are up over 348% on average in 2004!

7-Day Target: 3.40

30-Day Target: 5.70

1YR Target: 12.50

Examining LETH - By The Numbers:

Total Assets: 36.8 Million =3D 1.26 per share of assets
Cash: 23.4 Million =3D .80 cents per share of cash
Shares Outstanding: 29 million (down from 31.8 million) 
after 2.8 million shares retired in Feb. '04
Additional Shares to be Retired: 1.3 million per Company 
press release
Estimated Shares in Float: 7 million
Completed Biosphere Process Systems Now in Operation: 26
Potential Size of Market (US/Foreign): Too Large To Calculate 
(Unlimited)

Solving a Dual Crisis - Waste and Energy:

LETH is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of 
their Biosphere Process System to generate revenue from 
the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 5 to 7
 tons per hour which makes a major impact on the global waste 
problem. This profitable and environmentally safe process 
converts into clean, "green" electricity such waste materials 
as Municipal Solid Waste, agricultural wastes, forestry wastes, 
medical wastes, industrial wastes, sewage sludge, shale oil, 
sour natural gas, and the huge market of used tires. LETH 
profits from the sale of electricity created from the waste 
conversion on a continuous basis by generating 5 to 10 mega-
watts per hour of electricity which is then sold to replenish 
the local or national grid.

Record Backlog of Sales for LETH:

During the past year, over 20 Biosphere Process Systems have 
been ordered, which upon completion represents a backlog 
exceeding over $100 Million in upcoming sales. Many of these 
contractual agreements include options for the purchase of 
additional Biosphere Systems in the future once the initial 
order has been completed. The options vary from hundreds to 
thousands of units per contract which would send shockwaves 
through this low-float, emerging industry leader at an average 
sale price of $7 Million per Biosphere Process System!

Financing of $250 Million Positions LETH for Astronomical Sales:

The magnitude of this financing package goes much deeper than 
the fact that LETH trading at around $2.00, now has accessible 
capital equivalent to $8.62 per common share in cash. There 
are 26 Biosphere Process Systems presently in operation worldwide. 
The available funding could easily be used to produce 100 
additional Biospheres. Now factor in that the average sale price 
is $7 Million per Biosphere. We cannot even comprehend what this 
stock should be trading for with a potential $700,000,000 in 
future sales with 29 million shares outstanding!

Political Power Fosters Rapid Global Expansion:

LETH has captured the profit-making attention of both US and 
international investors by embracing a major foothold on the 
global waste problem as well as the urgent need to generate 
electricity from alternative sources. This has been accomplished 
by successfully creating major inroads to all corners of the 
globe through the political contacts at the highest level from 
Dr. Albert Reynolds, Chairman of LETH, who is also the former 
Prime Minister of Ireland. Dr. Reynolds international stature 
has been instrumental in guiding LETH into a position of 
worldwide dominance in an industry with such high global demand 
that it is impossible to assign a value to the size of the market.

Uncommon Value for a Company of this Caliber:

We are witnessing a breakout year in the making judging by the 
frequency of recently announced sales contracts for the Biosphere, 
the impressive backlog of over $100 Million in sales orders, and 
the Company's very solid financial position. We view this perfectly 
timed convergence of events as the catalyst for additional 
contracts that will perpetuate the shattering of the Company's 
own sales records. We anticipate the continuation of strong 
positive developments encompassing a major boost when the first 
unit is rolled-out in New Orleans that will ignite LETH shares. 
LETH carries our highest rating for short-term trading profits 
followed by robust long-term capital gains for aggressive 
portfolios looking for homerun performance.

LETH******LETH******LETH******LETH******LETH

Maximum Financial Stock Alert

Life Energy and Technology Holdings
(OTCBB: LETH)
Recent Price: 1.90
52 Week Range: 0.78 - 2.95
Avg. Volume (100 days): 198,099

LETH, a manufacturer of environmentally friendly 
waste-to-energy conversion systems, has filed the 
required Form 8-K with the SEC disclosing that the 
Company has received $250,000,000 in financing!

This funding package translates into $8.62 per share 
in cash for major worldwide expansion. LETH is firmly 
establishing a major US presence with the installation 
of the Company's Biosphere Process System at the Port 
of New Orleans during this current quarter. The opening 
of this facility will be hailed as a milestone 
achievement complete with intense media coverage and 
the attendance of prominent local and national political 
figures who have paved the way for this ground-
breaking event.

Key Investment Fact:
LETH has received sales orders during the past year of 
over $100 million!

Since Jan. 1, 2004 the overall market value
of our picks has increased by $Millions$!

Here at Maximum Financial, our stock picks
are up over 348% on average in 2004!

7-Day Target: 3.40

30-Day Target: 5.70

1YR Target: 12.50

Examining LETH - By The Numbers:

Total Assets: 36.8 Million =3D 1.26 per share of assets
Cash: 23.4 Million =3D .80 cents per share of cash
Shares Outstanding: 29 million (down from 31.8 million) 
after 2.8 million shares retired in Feb. '04
Additional Shares to be Retired: 1.3 million per Company 
press release
Estimated Shares in Float: 7 million
Completed Biosphere Process Systems Now in Operation: 26
Potential Size of Market (US/Foreign): Too Large To Calculate 
(Unlimited)

Solving a Dual Crisis - Waste and Energy:

LETH is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of 
their Biosphere Process System to generate revenue from 
the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 5 to 7
 tons per hour which makes a major impact on the global waste 
problem. This profitable and environmentally safe process 
converts into clean, "green" electricity such waste materials 
as Municipal Solid Waste, agricultural wastes, forestry wastes, 
medical wastes, industrial wastes, sewage sludge, shale oil, 
sour natural gas, and the huge market of used tires. LETH 
profits from the sale of electricity created from the waste 
conversion on a continuous basis by generating 5 to 10 mega-
watts per hour of electricity which is then sold to replenish 
the local or national grid.

Record Backlog of Sales for LETH:

During the past year, over 20 Biosphere Process Systems have 
been ordered, which upon completion represents a backlog 
exceeding over $100 Million in upcoming sales. Many of these 
contractual agreements include options for the purchase of 
additional Biosphere Systems in the future once the initial 
order has been completed. The options vary from hundreds to 
thousands of units per contract which would send shockwaves 
through this low-float, emerging industry leader at an average 
sale price of $7 Million per Biosphere Process System!

Financing of $250 Million Positions LETH for Astronomical Sales:

The magnitude of this financing package goes much deeper than 
the fact that LETH trading at around $2.00, now has accessible 
capital equivalent to $8.62 per common share in cash. There 
are 26 Biosphere Process Systems presently in operation worldwide. 
The available funding could easily be used to produce 100 
additional Biospheres. Now factor in that the average sale price 
is $7 Million per Biosphere. We cannot even comprehend what this 
stock should be trading for with a potential $700,000,000 in 
future sales with 29 million shares outstanding!

Political Power Fosters Rapid Global Expansion:

LETH has captured the profit-making attention of both US and 
international investors by embracing a major foothold on the 
global waste problem as well as the urgent need to generate 
electricity from alternative sources. This has been accomplished 
by successfully creating major inroads to all corners of the 
globe through the political contacts at the highest level from 
Dr. Albert Reynolds, Chairman of LETH, who is also the former 
Prime Minister of Ireland. Dr. Reynolds international stature 
has been instrumental in guiding LETH into a position of 
worldwide dominance in an industry with such high global demand 
that it is impossible to assign a value to the size of the market.

Uncommon Value for a Company of this Caliber:

We are witnessing a breakout year in the making judging by the 
frequency of recently announced sales contracts for the Biosphere, 
the impressive backlog of over $100 Million in sales orders, and 
the Company's very solid financial position. We view this perfectly 
timed convergence of events as the catalyst for additional 
contracts that will perpetuate the shattering of the Company's 
own sales records. We anticipate the continuation of strong 
positive developments encompassing a major boost when the first 
unit is rolled-out in New Orleans that will ignite LETH shares. 
LETH carries our highest rating for short-term trading profits 
followed by robust long-term capital gains for aggressive 
portfolios looking for homerun performance.

Hi,

I don't know if this has been looked at before, but i've had a few people
that have sent replies to my emails saying they can't access attachments
i've sent them (They're using Outlook/Outlook Express).  Some of these
people have been using email for years and I can't see it being PEBKAC, as
sending the same email from a webmail interface seems to work.

Does anyone know if Pine does something funky with it's email attachment
handling, or is there a "Outlook Compatability" option?

Thanks,
Lee

Hi,

I've experienced the same thing! For at least some of the recipients, it
showed up that the attachment WERE possible to open in Outlook, by using a
menu choice called "Save attachments". The message size indicated that the
attachment were there, but there were no paper clip symbol, and no
attachment in the bottom of the message while opened.

I did not investigate any further about the other recipients (made the doc
avail by http instead), but from the same e-mail that I sent to several
recipients, some could open the attachment, while others could not...

regards,

Does the 'quell-content-id' option in the Advanced User Preferences help?

When you hit 'S' in the attachment view, pine offers to save the file in
your home directory. Is there some way to make it use an alternate
location?  Is there maybe a patch that makes this configurable?

OK, yes. But I would like the default directory to be configurable so that
I don't have to do that every time I save an attachment. I don't want to
clutter ~/ any more than I have to, and I have a separate location for
random files I'm looking at at the moment. Having to type the same path in
manually every time is rather annoying.

I don't know about your version of pine, but at least the one I'm using
at the moment (4.58) saves into it's current save directory by default,
which means that without changing it e.g. by using the file browser,
it saves to the directory where I started pine.

I'm using pine 4.58 on netbsd, and I don't get the behavior you describe.
I ran pine with a cwd of /tmp/foo and saved an attachment to the default
location. It ended up in ~/ not in /tmp/foo.

In fact, if I use ^T to navigate to /tmp/foo while saving attachment A and
then save attachment B to the default, A ends up in /tmp/foo while B ends
up in ~/. (So there isn't even save directory persistence. It always goes
back to ~/ )

Is there some compile-time flag or configuration option that could be
causing the different behavior you describe?

LETH******LETH******LETH******LETH******LETH

Maximum Financial Stock Alert

Life Energy and Technology Holdings
(OTCBB: LETH)
Recent Price: 1.90
52 Week Range: 0.78 - 2.95
Avg. Volume (100 days): 198,099

LETH, a manufacturer of environmentally friendly 
waste-to-energy conversion systems, has filed the 
required Form 8-K with the SEC disclosing that the 
Company has received $250,000,000 in financing!

This funding package translates into $8.62 per share 
in cash for major worldwide expansion. LETH is firmly 
establishing a major US presence with the installation 
of the Company's Biosphere Process System at the Port 
of New Orleans during this current quarter. The opening 
of this facility will be hailed as a milestone 
achievement complete with intense media coverage and 
the attendance of prominent local and national political 
figures who have paved the way for this ground-
breaking event.

Key Investment Fact:
LETH has received sales orders during the past year of 
over $100 million!

Since Jan. 1, 2004 the overall market value
of our picks has increased by $Millions$!

Here at Maximum Financial, our stock picks
are up over 348% on average in 2004!

7-Day Target: 3.40

30-Day Target: 5.70

1YR Target: 12.50

Examining LETH - By The Numbers:

Total Assets: 36.8 Million =3D 1.26 per share of assets
Cash: 23.4 Million =3D .80 cents per share of cash
Shares Outstanding: 29 million (down from 31.8 million) 
after 2.8 million shares retired in Feb. '04
Additional Shares to be Retired: 1.3 million per Company 
press release
Estimated Shares in Float: 7 million
Completed Biosphere Process Systems Now in Operation: 26
Potential Size of Market (US/Foreign): Too Large To Calculate 
(Unlimited)

Solving a Dual Crisis - Waste and Energy:

LETH is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of 
their Biosphere Process System to generate revenue from 
the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 5 to 7
 tons per hour which makes a major impact on the global waste 
problem. This profitable and environmentally safe process 
converts into clean, "green" electricity such waste materials 
as Municipal Solid Waste, agricultural wastes, forestry wastes, 
medical wastes, industrial wastes, sewage sludge, shale oil, 
sour natural gas, and the huge market of used tires. LETH 
profits from the sale of electricity created from the waste 
conversion on a continuous basis by generating 5 to 10 mega-
watts per hour of electricity which is then sold to replenish 
the local or national grid.

Record Backlog of Sales for LETH:

During the past year, over 20 Biosphere Process Systems have 
been ordered, which upon completion represents a backlog 
exceeding over $100 Million in upcoming sales. Many of these 
contractual agreements include options for the purchase of 
additional Biosphere Systems in the future once the initial 
order has been completed. The options vary from hundreds to 
thousands of units per contract which would send shockwaves 
through this low-float, emerging industry leader at an average 
sale price of $7 Million per Biosphere Process System!

Financing of $250 Million Positions LETH for Astronomical Sales:

The magnitude of this financing package goes much deeper than 
the fact that LETH trading at around $2.00, now has accessible 
capital equivalent to $8.62 per common share in cash. There 
are 26 Biosphere Process Systems presently in operation worldwide. 
The available funding could easily be used to produce 100 
additional Biospheres. Now factor in that the average sale price 
is $7 Million per Biosphere. We cannot even comprehend what this 
stock should be trading for with a potential $700,000,000 in 
future sales with 29 million shares outstanding!

Political Power Fosters Rapid Global Expansion:

LETH has captured the profit-making attention of both US and 
international investors by embracing a major foothold on the 
global waste problem as well as the urgent need to generate 
electricity from alternative sources. This has been accomplished 
by successfully creating major inroads to all corners of the 
globe through the political contacts at the highest level from 
Dr. Albert Reynolds, Chairman of LETH, who is also the former 
Prime Minister of Ireland. Dr. Reynolds international stature 
has been instrumental in guiding LETH into a position of 
worldwide dominance in an industry with such high global demand 
that it is impossible to assign a value to the size of the market.

Uncommon Value for a Company of this Caliber:

We are witnessing a breakout year in the making judging by the 
frequency of recently announced sales contracts for the Biosphere, 
the impressive backlog of over $100 Million in sales orders, and 
the Company's very solid financial position. We view this perfectly 
timed convergence of events as the catalyst for additional 
contracts that will perpetuate the shattering of the Company's 
own sales records. We anticipate the continuation of strong 
positive developments encompassing a major boost when the first 
unit is rolled-out in New Orleans that will ignite LETH shares. 
LETH carries our highest rating for short-term trading profits 
followed by robust long-term capital gains for aggressive 
portfolios looking for homerun performance.

which will set the Status flag for any unread message that has a priority
of 1 or 2 or high.


The problem is, when the new message comes in, Pine sets the flag like it
is supposed to, but the message is missing from the index.

I need to either move to another folder and then back, or execute a
command that refreshes the index (ie: expunge) in order to retrieve the
message.

Moreover, Im wondering why Pine does not automatically set the flag for
messages with the (X-)Priority header set.


 Thanks

These two inbox-path setting are identical, unless the logged-in user is 
something other than "mattack".  The only thing that "/user=" does is set 
the userid for IMAP login (which otherwise default to the logged-in 
userid).

What, precisely, are these "SSL errors" that you are getting?

I can confirm that if you use /notls Pine will not negotiate TLS with the 
IMAP server.

What, precisely, is the "auth warning" that you are refer to?

If this is the "SECURITY PROBLEM: insecure server advertised AUTH=PLAIN" 
warning, then I can assure you that you are *not* using SSL or TLS. 
What's more, every time that you log in to the server any hacker can 
easily steal your password.  It is not a good idea to comment out that 
warning.

When trying to move to other mailboxes, or trying to compose a new message
when there is a postponed message (in which mail itself is "moving to other
mailboxes" AFAIK), I get:

          [SSL/TLS failure for mail.apple.com: SSL negotiation failed]

*EVEN WITH* the /notls at the end of my inbox-path.  But after living with
the first setting above for several days, the SSL errors are much much
less frequent.  I still get one near the start of my session, but not
very often, like I do with the second form.  (But again, to be clear, I
should not get ANY with either form.. right?)

I presume the first instance of that same warning is when I get this:

There was an SSL/TLS failure for the server

                                mail.apple.com

The reason for the failure was

                            SSL negotiation failed
...and so on..

Then why am I getting the SSL failures?

Then these seem to be at odds.  I am getting the SSL *AND* SECURITY PROBLEM
warnings very often.

The mail server is behind a firewall.  Is there some way I can get these
AUTH=PLAIN warnings to stop happening then?  Obviously I can't change the
company's mail server.


Thanks for your reply though.. I have sent various questions/rants about these
two problems several times, and this is the first time I've gotten a good
reply (others have just said they comment out the latter warning!)

Hi there.

I have various mail moved into folders by filter rules
and this has been working fine.  But recently I've noticed
that I get duplicate copies of messages.  (Only two copies
of the message total.)

So someone mails me on a mailing list, it gets automatically
put into the folder for that mailing list.  I go to look at
that folder, and there are two copies of that message.

So someone mails me not on a mailing list, it stays in my
inbox, only one copy of it, and I read it.  I then eXpunge
and because it is a friend it gets filtered to a folder
dedicated to them.  I go look at that folder, and there are
two copies of that message.

This wasn't happening before, and I can't think of anything
that I've changed.  This is pine 4.58.

Any suggestions?

-James

James,
In your filtering rules, check the box near the bottom that says:
"move-only-if-not-deleted."
Do that for each filter.
The name of the feature wouldn't lead one to think it applies, but it
does, and no, I can't think of a better name!
That's probably the most likely reason for the duplicates.

LETH******LETH******LETH******LETH******LETH

Maximum Financial Stock Alert

Life Energy and Technology Holdings
(OTCBB: LETH)
Recent Price: 1.90
52 Week Range: 0.78 - 2.95
Avg. Volume (100 days): 198,099

LETH, a manufacturer of environmentally friendly 
waste-to-energy conversion systems, has filed the 
required Form 8-K with the SEC disclosing that the 
Company has received $250,000,000 in financing!

This funding package translates into $8.62 per share 
in cash for major worldwide expansion. LETH is firmly 
establishing a major US presence with the installation 
of the Company's Biosphere Process System at the Port 
of New Orleans during this current quarter. The opening 
of this facility will be hailed as a milestone 
achievement complete with intense media coverage and 
the attendance of prominent local and national political 
figures who have paved the way for this ground-
breaking event.

Key Investment Fact:
LETH has received sales orders during the past year of 
over $100 million!

Since Jan. 1, 2004 the overall market value
of our picks has increased by $Millions$!

Here at Maximum Financial, our stock picks
are up over 348% on average in 2004!

7-Day Target: 3.40

30-Day Target: 5.70

1YR Target: 12.50

Examining LETH - By The Numbers:

Total Assets: 36.8 Million =3D 1.26 per share of assets
Cash: 23.4 Million =3D .80 cents per share of cash
Shares Outstanding: 29 million (down from 31.8 million) 
after 2.8 million shares retired in Feb. '04
Additional Shares to be Retired: 1.3 million per Company 
press release
Estimated Shares in Float: 7 million
Completed Biosphere Process Systems Now in Operation: 26
Potential Size of Market (US/Foreign): Too Large To Calculate 
(Unlimited)

Solving a Dual Crisis - Waste and Energy:

LETH is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of 
their Biosphere Process System to generate revenue from 
the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 5 to 7
 tons per hour which makes a major impact on the global waste 
problem. This profitable and environmentally safe process 
converts into clean, "green" electricity such waste materials 
as Municipal Solid Waste, agricultural wastes, forestry wastes, 
medical wastes, industrial wastes, sewage sludge, shale oil, 
sour natural gas, and the huge market of used tires. LETH 
profits from the sale of electricity created from the waste 
conversion on a continuous basis by generating 5 to 10 mega-
watts per hour of electricity which is then sold to replenish 
the local or national grid.

Record Backlog of Sales for LETH:

During the past year, over 20 Biosphere Process Systems have 
been ordered, which upon completion represents a backlog 
exceeding over $100 Million in upcoming sales. Many of these 
contractual agreements include options for the purchase of 
additional Biosphere Systems in the future once the initial 
order has been completed. The options vary from hundreds to 
thousands of units per contract which would send shockwaves 
through this low-float, emerging industry leader at an average 
sale price of $7 Million per Biosphere Process System!

Financing of $250 Million Positions LETH for Astronomical Sales:

The magnitude of this financing package goes much deeper than 
the fact that LETH trading at around $2.00, now has accessible 
capital equivalent to $8.62 per common share in cash. There 
are 26 Biosphere Process Systems presently in operation worldwide. 
The available funding could easily be used to produce 100 
additional Biospheres. Now factor in that the average sale price 
is $7 Million per Biosphere. We cannot even comprehend what this 
stock should be trading for with a potential $700,000,000 in 
future sales with 29 million shares outstanding!

Political Power Fosters Rapid Global Expansion:

LETH has captured the profit-making attention of both US and 
international investors by embracing a major foothold on the 
global waste problem as well as the urgent need to generate 
electricity from alternative sources. This has been accomplished 
by successfully creating major inroads to all corners of the 
globe through the political contacts at the highest level from 
Dr. Albert Reynolds, Chairman of LETH, who is also the former 
Prime Minister of Ireland. Dr. Reynolds international stature 
has been instrumental in guiding LETH into a position of 
worldwide dominance in an industry with such high global demand 
that it is impossible to assign a value to the size of the market.

Uncommon Value for a Company of this Caliber:

We are witnessing a breakout year in the making judging by the 
frequency of recently announced sales contracts for the Biosphere, 
the impressive backlog of over $100 Million in sales orders, and 
the Company's very solid financial position. We view this perfectly 
timed convergence of events as the catalyst for additional 
contracts that will perpetuate the shattering of the Company's 
own sales records. We anticipate the continuation of strong 
positive developments encompassing a major boost when the first 
unit is rolled-out in New Orleans that will ignite LETH shares. 
LETH carries our highest rating for short-term trading profits 
followed by robust long-term capital gains for aggressive 
portfolios looking for homerun performance.

I just read the help for that page..  Doesn't that essentially conflict with:

Message is Deleted? =
            Set    Choose One
            ---  --------------------
            (*)  Don't care, always matches
            ( )  Yes
            ( )  No

That is, if you simply say No here, isn't that effectively the same thing
as checking that check box?   (And if so, then it seems bizarre to have
two contradictory settings.)

LETH******LETH******LETH******LETH******LETH

Maximum Financial Stock Alert

Life Energy and Technology Holdings
(OTCBB: LETH)
Recent Price: 1.90
52 Week Range: 0.78 - 2.95
Avg. Volume (100 days): 198,099

LETH, a manufacturer of environmentally friendly 
waste-to-energy conversion systems, has filed the 
required Form 8-K with the SEC disclosing that the 
Company has received $250,000,000 in financing!

This funding package translates into $8.62 per share 
in cash for major worldwide expansion. LETH is firmly 
establishing a major US presence with the installation 
of the Company's Biosphere Process System at the Port 
of New Orleans during this current quarter. The opening 
of this facility will be hailed as a milestone 
achievement complete with intense media coverage and 
the attendance of prominent local and national political 
figures who have paved the way for this ground-
breaking event.

Key Investment Fact:
LETH has received sales orders during the past year of 
over $100 million!

Since Jan. 1, 2004 the overall market value
of our picks has increased by $Millions$!

Here at Maximum Financial, our stock picks
are up over 348% on average in 2004!

7-Day Target: 3.40

30-Day Target: 5.70

1YR Target: 12.50

Examining LETH - By The Numbers:

Total Assets: 36.8 Million =3D 1.26 per share of assets
Cash: 23.4 Million =3D .80 cents per share of cash
Shares Outstanding: 29 million (down from 31.8 million) 
after 2.8 million shares retired in Feb. '04
Additional Shares to be Retired: 1.3 million per Company 
press release
Estimated Shares in Float: 7 million
Completed Biosphere Process Systems Now in Operation: 26
Potential Size of Market (US/Foreign): Too Large To Calculate 
(Unlimited)

Solving a Dual Crisis - Waste and Energy:

LETH is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of 
their Biosphere Process System to generate revenue from 
the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 5 to 7
 tons per hour which makes a major impact on the global waste 
problem. This profitable and environmentally safe process 
converts into clean, "green" electricity such waste materials 
as Municipal Solid Waste, agricultural wastes, forestry wastes, 
medical wastes, industrial wastes, sewage sludge, shale oil, 
sour natural gas, and the huge market of used tires. LETH 
profits from the sale of electricity created from the waste 
conversion on a continuous basis by generating 5 to 10 mega-
watts per hour of electricity which is then sold to replenish 
the local or national grid.

Record Backlog of Sales for LETH:

During the past year, over 20 Biosphere Process Systems have 
been ordered, which upon completion represents a backlog 
exceeding over $100 Million in upcoming sales. Many of these 
contractual agreements include options for the purchase of 
additional Biosphere Systems in the future once the initial 
order has been completed. The options vary from hundreds to 
thousands of units per contract which would send shockwaves 
through this low-float, emerging industry leader at an average 
sale price of $7 Million per Biosphere Process System!

Financing of $250 Million Positions LETH for Astronomical Sales:

The magnitude of this financing package goes much deeper than 
the fact that LETH trading at around $2.00, now has accessible 
capital equivalent to $8.62 per common share in cash. There 
are 26 Biosphere Process Systems presently in operation worldwide. 
The available funding could easily be used to produce 100 
additional Biospheres. Now factor in that the average sale price 
is $7 Million per Biosphere. We cannot even comprehend what this 
stock should be trading for with a potential $700,000,000 in 
future sales with 29 million shares outstanding!

Political Power Fosters Rapid Global Expansion:

LETH has captured the profit-making attention of both US and 
international investors by embracing a major foothold on the 
global waste problem as well as the urgent need to generate 
electricity from alternative sources. This has been accomplished 
by successfully creating major inroads to all corners of the 
globe through the political contacts at the highest level from 
Dr. Albert Reynolds, Chairman of LETH, who is also the former 
Prime Minister of Ireland. Dr. Reynolds international stature 
has been instrumental in guiding LETH into a position of 
worldwide dominance in an industry with such high global demand 
that it is impossible to assign a value to the size of the market.

Uncommon Value for a Company of this Caliber:

We are witnessing a breakout year in the making judging by the 
frequency of recently announced sales contracts for the Biosphere, 
the impressive backlog of over $100 Million in sales orders, and 
the Company's very solid financial position. We view this perfectly 
timed convergence of events as the catalyst for additional 
contracts that will perpetuate the shattering of the Company's 
own sales records. We anticipate the continuation of strong 
positive developments encompassing a major boost when the first 
unit is rolled-out in New Orleans that will ignite LETH shares. 
LETH carries our highest rating for short-term trading profits 
followed by robust long-term capital gains for aggressive 
portfolios looking for homerun performance.

Yes, you are correct. If the "Message is Deleted?" option had existed at 
the time the "move-only-if-not-deleted" option was added, then it clearly 
wouldn't have been added. The "Message is Deleted?" option was added to 
pine at the same time as the other message status checks and it seemed 
worth the consistency to add it even though it was possible to set it in 
the feature section. Also, "move-only-if-not-deleted" is only a Filter 
feature, whereas "Message is Deleted?" works for all rules. But it is a 
bit bizarre, yes.

If you run pine with "-d verbose=9,imap=4" you may be able to look at the

How is the folder accessed? That is, is it an IMAP folder, POP, news, etc.

Do other new messages that don't have the X-Priority header show up in the 
index?

There is no standard interpretation of the headers, so your X-Priority of 
1, 2, or High equals Important message might not match somebody else's. So 
we let you decide what you want to do.

	Instead of bouncing with the resent-from header added, it seems to
put the entire email, headers and all, into the body of the message

	See forwarded message below for what I'm getting.

	IIRC, it's something flaky about this Pine implementation, or in
the sendmail implementation, but I'm not sure what.

I have also noticed this behaviour sometimes ago.

Just to be sure, are you using filters that moves or delete mail before

So then maybe the Message Is Deleted and "move-only-if-not-deleted" options
should remain in sync.

i.e. if the user changes the checkbox, the radio buttons change to remain
in sync.

..or else remove one of them on filter options to further consistency..

(Yes, even text-based programs can have good Human Interface!  Pine is
actually my best example that a text-based app can be just as easy to use
as a GUI app.)

This sounds awfully similar to a very very sporadic problem that I was seeing
(and have mentioned here) when saving a message from one folder to another..
Once in a rare while, the saved message would be all munged and I'd see the
headers (most of them at least) all of the time/in the body.

Locally.

<font face=verdana size=1 color="#F3F3F3">Not long ago and not far away there was a beautiful, big teddy bear who sat on a shelf in a drug store waiting for someone to buy him and give him a home.His name was Wolstencroft. And he was no ordinary bear.His fur was a lovely shade of light grey, and he had honey colored ears, nose and feet. His eyes were warm and kind and he had a wonderfully wise look on his face.Wolstencroft looked very smart in a brown plaid waistcoat with a gold satin bow tie at his neck.Attached to the tie was a tag with his name written in bold, black letters
He had arrived in the store just before Christmas when there had been a lovely big tree in the window, all decorated with fairy lights. Yards and yards of sparkling tinsel had been draped over everything, and holiday music had been playing all the time. Wolstencroft was especially fond of Jingle Bells. He liked its light, tinkling sounds. It always made him feel merry.At that time there had been lots of other bears to keep him company. In fact, there had been so many teddy bears crowded onto that one narrow shelf that he had scarcely had room to move. 
But, one by one they had all gone. Gleefully waving goodbye as they were carried off to their new homes. Until finally, he was the only teddy bear left in the entire store.He had hoped that Santa Claus would drop by on Christmas Eve and deliver him to a good home. But he hadn’t. Santa had been too busy that year, delivering even more presents than usual.Wolstencroft felt sad and lonely sitting there all by himself on the shelf that was high above the Christmas cards. He longed to have a child take him home and love him and play with him. But, most of all, to hug him. For no hug is ever too big for a teddy bear.
Then one day, shortly before Easter, three bunny rabbits were placed on the shelf beside him. They all had very big ears and feet and long legs. All three were wearing woolen sweaters. Rita Rabbit wore a pink sweater. Roger Rabbit a green one. And Ronnie wore blue. Roger and Ronnie were twins, and Rita was their sister. "My you are a handsome bear," Rita told Wolstencroft after the store had closed for the night. "I’m surprised that no one has bought you and taken you home." "So am I," replied Wolstencroft and, although he tried very hard to stop it, a tear rolled down his furry cheek. Ronnie and Roger had jumped down off the shelf and were playing tag up and down the aisles. He was trying hard not to cry because he knew that tears would make his eyes all puffy and red and then he would have even less chance of finding a home.  But why oh why didn’t someone choose him? Why, he wondered, was he passed over so many times for other less beautiful bears?</font>

ATTN:SIR/MADAM
 
I am Baldwin Onuigbo, Bank Manager of DIAMOND BANK PLC, Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. I got your contact from my private search for a reliable and trusted foreign partner.
On June 6 1997, an American oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty-five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in the Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will c
ome forward to claim it. According to the Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 6{Six} years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Barry Kelly so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple;
1) I will like you to provide me immediately with your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin.
2) We shall employ the services of two attorneys for drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.
3) A bank account in any part of the world, which you provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin of Mr.Barry Kelly. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you.
There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address above. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.
Awaiting your urgent reply.
 
Thanks and regards,
Baldwin Onuigbo.

Total Assets: 36.8 Million =3D 1.26 per share of assets
Cash: 23.4 Million =3D .80 cents per share of cash
Shares Outstanding: 29 million (down from 31.8 million) 
after 2.8 million shares retired in Feb. '04
Additional Shares to be Retired: 1.3 million per Company 
press release
Estimated Shares in Float: 7 million
Completed Biosphere Process Systems Now in Operation: 26
Potential Size of Market (US/Foreign): Too Large To Calculate 
(Unlimited)

Solving a Dual Crisis - Waste and Energy:

LETH is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of 
their Biosphere Process System to generate revenue from 
the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 5 to 7
 tons per hour which makes a major impact on the global waste 
problem. This profitable and environmentally safe process 
converts into clean, "green" electricity such waste materials 
as Municipal Solid Waste, agricultural wastes, forestry wastes, 
medical wastes, industrial wastes, sewage sludge, shale oil, 
sour natural gas, and the huge market of used tires. LETH 
profits from the sale of electricity created from the waste 
conversion on a continuous basis by generating 5 to 10 mega-
watts per hour of electricity which is then sold to replenish 
the local or national grid.

Record Backlog of Sales for LETH:

During the past year, over 20 Biosphere Process Systems have 
been ordered, which upon completion represents a backlog 
exceeding over $100 Million in upcoming sales. Many of these 
contractual agreements include options for the purchase of 
additional Biosphere Systems in the future once the initial 
order has been completed. The options vary from hundreds to 
thousands of units per contract which would send shockwaves 
through this low-float, emerging industry leader at an average 
sale price of $7 Million per Biosphere Process System!

Financing of $250 Million Positions LETH for Astronomical Sales:

The magnitude of this financing package goes much deeper than 
the fact that LETH trading at around $2.00, now has accessible 
capital equivalent to $8.62 per common share in cash. There 
are 26 Biosphere Process Systems presently in operation worldwide. 
The available funding could easily be used to produce 100 
additional Biospheres. Now factor in that the average sale price 
is $7 Million per Biosphere. We cannot even comprehend what this 
stock should be trading for with a potential $700,000,000 in 
future sales with 29 million shares outstanding!

Political Power Fosters Rapid Global Expansion:

LETH has captured the profit-making attention of both US and 
international investors by embracing a major foothold on the 
global waste problem as well as the urgent need to generate 
electricity from alternative sources. This has been accomplished 
by successfully creating major inroads to all corners of the 
globe through the political contacts at the highest level from 
Dr. Albert Reynolds, Chairman of LETH, who is also the former 
Prime Minister of Ireland. Dr. Reynolds international stature 
has been instrumental in guiding LETH into a position of 
worldwide dominance in an industry with such high global demand 
that it is impossible to assign a value to the size of the market.

Uncommon Value for a Company of this Caliber:

We are witnessing a breakout year in the making judging by the 
frequency of recently announced sales contracts for the Biosphere, 
the impressive backlog of over $100 Million in sales orders, and 
the Company's very solid financial position. We view this perfectly 
timed convergence of events as the catalyst for additional 
contracts that will perpetuate the shattering of the Company's 
own sales records. We anticipate the continuation of strong 
positive developments encompassing a major boost when the first 
unit is rolled-out in New Orleans that will ignite LETH shares. 
LETH carries our highest rating for short-term trading profits 
followed by robust long-term capital gains for aggressive 
portfolios looking for homerun performance.

Hello,

I use LDAP for address book, and it works very well.

However, LDAP uses UTF8 and I use ISO-8859-1 in my terminals, so when I
look up a person whos name contains a non-ascii character (for instance
myself) there is the problem that it will show up UTF8-encoded.

Is it possible to tell pine to convert the LDAP search result from UTF8 to
whatever is set in the locale settings?

Pine uses version 2 of the LDAP protocol which means that results from the=

the pine LDAP support so that it uses version 3 instead.

It seems to match what I noticed, but I do not remember exactly how were
ordered my filters at that time.

May you try with the filter which sets the status before the "moving"

<font face=verdana size=1 color="#F3F3F3">Sti'Tumma had always wanted to have beautiful beaded "shooflies" attached to her saddle, on the breastplate and under the horse's tummy on the cinch. She had already made a couple for her favorite bridle! The shooflies were made from a small amount of horsehair being folded in half, wrapped with buckskin, and beadwork put over the buckskin. The shoofly would then be clipped onto the favorite spot selected by each rider. So when the horses had their tails cleaned, the hair was saved for Sti'Tumma who then went to work to make herself some beautiful and colorful shooflies. Sometimes Gilly, Sti'Tumma's sister, would do the beadwork on a dozen shooflies at a time for the trail guides. The shooflies would move with the horse and keep some of the flies from settling on the horse! 

      It was a beautiful Saturday morning and time to get ready to meet the scheduled trail riders at the lake for the 20-mile ride through the beautiful countryside. Her nephew and youngest brother saddled her horse while she went to select the shooflies to attach to her saddle today. Across the breastplate she clipped six, on the cinch she clipped two, and on the rear of the saddle she clipped two. She stood back to take a good look, and said to herself, "Today both Zoomer and I will look good!" 

     At the lake she stayed on horseback due to the pain she was feeling in her back and neck; getting off and on would only make it worse. Today she wanted to be able to complete the ride to show off all her hard work on the beautiful and colorful shooflies. By wearing her new ribbon shirt, she looked elegant upon that gorgeous horse with all the beadwork showing on the shooflies. She met the riders, gathered the riding fees, which were placed in the beaded bag tied tight to her saddle, and even had some pictures taken of her and Zoomer! 

     Today Sti'Tumma would begin the trail ride by trailing the riders. She took her time, although Zoomer wanted to be in the lead of the pack. What a lovely day, open views for nice photos, and she noticed that the riders were taking some lovely shots. Zoomer was becoming impatient, so Sti'Tumma let him walk a bit faster to get to the head of the riders. She was almost to the beginning of the riders when a pair of riders, an elder cowboy and his wife, moved up to talk to her. The lady asked, "We were wondering if you are a medicine lady, you have all the scalps with beadwork on them displayed on your saddle. And we wanted to know how you got anyone to actually touch the scalps to put the beadwork on them." 

     Sti'Tumma started chuckling, and then broke out in laughter! Her younger brother, the lead trail guide for today, stopped the group to check on his sister. Sti'Tumma decided this was a good spot to take a break and talk about the shooflies she was so proud of. By the time the riders started off again on the ride, the whole Country Trail Ride crew were amazed at how many of these city cowboys and cowgirls didn't understand the Native Americans at all, they still believed there was scalping and raiding going on within the reservation! Scalps, what a joke, now every trail guide would want to be decorated with the "scalps" displayed on their horse to show their "honor within the Tribe"! 

     Since that ride, and all the jokes and laughter about the medicine lady and her scalps, Gilly has been able to have a dozen "imitation scalps" beaded and ready for sale at each trail ride during the lunch break at the wonderful and remodeled old campsite.

Hello list,

I've searched the archives for IMAP information, and I'm struggling to
understand my problem.  TIA for helping.

I have one IMAP server successfully configured in PINE.  I'm trying to add
another different server.

After entering the setup page & the configure lists (L) section, I enter
in all the information I have (unfortunately PINE is not supported through
the company's IST group, so I'm limping along): imap.novell.com

I do not have a path.  When I save & exit, I receive the following error:

[Server disables LOGIN; no SASL Authenticator]

Is there an authenticator that I am missing?

Any ideas on which part of the authentication is failing?

I thought PINE would automatically search for the folders on the server,
but I am never prompted for a new UN/PW, so how can it?

Thanks again for helping!




Best regards,

I've already e-mailed Mark Crispin but I thought I'd hit the group as well
for input.  I'm currently running Pine 4.58 with the attendant IMAP daemon
as well on an HP box running Tru64 UNIX version 5.1B.  The package is built
without SSL for now.  At any rate, our system uses "enhanced security" so I
had to to a "build sos" to build the package.  If a user's password is
pre-expired (must be changed upon first login) or the account is locked,
IMAP still accepts the connection.  Is there any way to prevent this
behavior?  Thanks. in advance.

We want to transfer to overseas the sum of One hundred
and Forty Two Million United States Dollars
(U.S.$142,000,000.00) from a in Africa.

I want to ask you to kindly look for a reliable and 
honest person who will be capable and fit to provide 
either an existing bank account or to set up a new 
bank account immediately to receive this money,
though an empty bank account could serve this purpose
as long as you will remain honest to me till the end 
of this important business trusting in you and
believing in God that you will never let me down 
either now or in time to come.

I am IDARIPAUL,the external auditor of a Bank.During
the course of our auditing,I discovered a floating
fund in an account opened in the bank in 1990 and
since 1993 nobody has operated on this account
again.After going through some old files in the
records, I discovered that the owner of the account
died without a “Heir apparent to the throne” hence the
money is floating and if I do not remit this money
out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. 

The owner of this account who is Mr.Eshed.B.Willey,
a foreigner and an industrialist died, since
1990,until now no other person(s) knows about this
account or could give any documentary evidence
concerning this account. As such this account has no
other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as
well that Eshed.B.Willey until his death was the
manager Oriental Diamond Company,in South Africa. 

However, if you are interested in this business we
will start the first money transfer with Forty Two
Million U.S.Dollars(U.S.$42,000,000.00) upon
successful transaction without any disappointment from
you. We shall also re-apply for the payment of the
remaining amount to your account. 

While the total amount involved is One hundred and
Forty Two Million United States Dollars
(U.S.$142,000,000.00)only. I would want us to make
a first transfer of [Forty Two Million United States
Dollar.(U.S.$42,000,000.00)from this money into a safe
Foreigners account abroad before the rest. I am only
contacting you as a foreigner because this money can
not be approved to a local account, without valid
international foreign “Agreement”, but could only be
approved to any foreigner with valid international 
credentials: passport or drivers license and foreign 
account because this sum is in U.S. dollars and 
the former owner of the account Mr.Eshed.B.Willey is a
foreigner too, thus the money could only be approved
into a foreign account. 

However, knowing all this, we will reach a binding
agreement in this regards.

As a matter of urgency, I will inform you the next
step to take, while you Send your private telephone
and fax number including the full details of the
account to be used for the deposit.

I want us to meet face to face to build confidence
and to sign a binding agreement that will bind us
together before transferring the money to any account
of your choice where the fund will be safe. Before we
fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing and
investments,I need your full co-operation to make
this business a success, because the management is
ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has
correct information of this account, which I will give
to you,upon your positive response and once I am
convinced that you are capable and will meet up with
the instructions of a key bank official who is deeply 
involved with me in this business. I need your strong
assurance that you will never let me down.

With my influence and the position in the bank
we can transfer this money to any foreigner's
reliable account which you can provide with assurance
that this money will be intact pending our physical
arrival in your country for sharing.
And to build confidence that you can come immediately
to discuss with me face to face after which I will
make this remittance in your presence and three of us
will fly to your country at least two days ahead of
the money going into the account.

I will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately 
I hear from you that you are ready to act as directed.

To prove the authenticity of the business I will use
my position and influence to obtain all legal
approvals
for onward transfer of this money to your account with
appropriate clearance from the relevant ministries,
foreign exchange departments, embassy and Board of
Internal Revenue Services.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be
given 35% of the total amount, 60% will be for me,
while 5% will be for expenses both parties might have
incurred during this process.

I look forward to your earliest reply through
my email address.    :idaripaul@zwallet.com

Yours 


IDARI PAUL,

Hello list,

I've searched the archives for IMAP information, and I'm struggling to
understand my problem.  TIA for helping.

I have one IMAP server successfully configured in PINE.  I'm trying to add
another different server.

After entering the setup page & the configure lists (L) section, I enter
in all the information I have (unfortunately PINE is not supported through
the company's IST group, so I'm limping along): imap.novell.com

I do not have a path.  When I save & exit, I receive the following error:

[Server disables LOGIN; no SASL Authenticator]

Is there an authenticator that I am missing?

Any ideas on which part of the authentication is failing?

I thought PINE would automatically search for the folders on the server,
but I am never prompted for a new UN/PW, so how can it?

Thanks again for helping!




Best regards,


Marissa Krupa

Quick question:

I've just switched ISPs, and am now with Verizon.  I'm using Pc-Pine to access 
university email, but each time I try to send messages, it cancels SMTP 
authentication.  I can find no other way to authenticate other than something 
like 'outgoing.verizon.net/user=username' 
or 'outgoing.verizon.net/user=username pass=password'.  

Any thoughts?

Thanks!

Hello,

I changed this to:  imap.novell.com/ssl/user=[blah]

And I was prompted for my password!  Then I was prompted to save the
changes.

However, when I went to the folder list, the IMAP folders were still
empty.  There wasn't even an inbox, although I indicated INBOX.* in the
folderlist setup.

I know I'm really close, but still slightly blind.  Any suggestions would
be much appreciated.

Thank you!

Is the IMAP server UW-IMAP? Then try to specify the path to the folders.
For my folder collection (not INBOX) I specify

  Nickname  : Mailfolders
  Server    : [127.0.0.1]/user=dufberg/NoRsh
  Path      : ~dufberg/mailfolders/
  View      :

For the inbox try with path INBOX, that is

{[127.0.0.1]/user=dufberg/NoRsh}INBOX

Dear Sir,
 
My name is Adams Abubakar,I am the operational manager in account management section incharge of credit and foreign bills of one of the prime banks here in South Africa. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank who perished with his whole families on
25TH JULY,2000 CONCORDE PLANE CRASH [ Flight AF4590 ] with the whole passengers aboard.  
 
There is an account opened in this bank in 1998 by this great late INDUSTRIALIST who died without a written or oral WILL attatched to the account. Since his death , I personally has watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds and no other person knows about this account or anything concerning it,the account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the manager of his company. 
 
The total amount involved is 16,000,000.00 USD.[Sixteen million United States Dollar ]. We wish to start the first transfer with $6,000,000.00[Six million] and open successful transaction without any disappointment from your side, we shall re-apply for the transfer of the remaining balance to your account. 
 
I have secretly discussed this matter with the general manager of the bank who I must involve in order to have a smooth and a successful transfer of the fund to any foreign bank account which you are going to nominate. On this note, I decided to seek for a reliable foreigner who will act as the foreign beneficiary of the fund from the deceased by providing his/her bank account where the fund will be transferred for immediate investment on any viable project as no one has come up to be the next of kin.
 
 
The banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than six years without claim hence the money will be recalled to the government treasury as unclaimed after this long period of domancy. 
 
 
In view of this I got your contact through my personal search to see if you can assist by providing your safe bank account for the transfer or find a reliable person who will be capable of receiving such amount in
his or her personal account.At the conclussion of the transfer 65% of the fund will be for me, I will give you 20% of the total transfer sum, 10% for charity both in Africa and in your country while the remaining 5% will be set aside to settle expenses both parties might incure during the transfer process. 
 
Upon the receipt of your reply, I will send to you a detailed information about the transaction.I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is 100% risk and trouble free and that you should not
entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within 7 to 9 banking days, after you apply to the bank as the beneficiary of the fund from the deceased. When you receive this letter. Kindly send me an e-mail or you can call me or fax me. You should also include
your private fax and phone numbers for easy and safe communication. 
 
Respectfully yours,
 
Adams Abubakar
