It took me a while to figure out what you're asking for.  This has nothing 
to do with the "build"; what you want is to have client code use that 
path.

How is this useful?  It's one thing to want to store server certificates 
in a different directory (more importantly, the server private keys).  But 
CA certificates and public keys should be global for all applications.

It is useful as we do not want to rebuild OpenSSL but prefer to keep 
certificates/keys in their own local directory (not part of the system 
OpenSSL installation). All other OpenSSL-aware applications we use; 
Apache, WU-IMAP, Postfix, stunnel, etc; allow us to specify where they 
look for certificates and keys.

As you are allowed to set SSLCERTS on the build command line, I thought it 
really meant something, but that variable was only used in the build 
script for some simple checks. We build WU-IMAP with SSLCERTS set to our 
own directory and that works great (it then looks for imapd.pem and 
ipop3d.pem there). It would be great if Pine would use SSLCERTS (build 
command line) as its default location for looking up certificates as well.

Also one might have different trust for different application usage, and 
hence want to trust different (number of) CAs for different applications.

Sincerely,
   Henrik

I am also interested in this for a different reason. I use Mac OS X,
which isn't using the latest version of OpenSSL. Since I don't want to
mess with the System files, which can cause problems for OS updates from
Apple, among other things, I installed the latest version in
/usr/local/. I also don't want to add things into the System Library if,
for example, I need to add certificates. So, I want to build Pine so it
uses the /usr/local/ installation of OpenSSL and looks for certificates
in the appropriate directory there.

I'm not sure I'm not missing something, because I know very little about
OpenSSL and am really whistling in the dark. So, I apologise in advance
if I'm way off.

Clea

Dear Sir/Madam       

My name is Mr.J.Frances,I am the operational manager
in account management section incharge of credit and
foreign bills of one of the prime banks here in South
Africa. 

I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my 
bank who perished on EGYPTIAN Boeing 737 PLANE CRASH
into the red sea CONCORDE PLANE CRASH with the whole
passengers aboard.

There is an account opened in this bank by this great
late INDUSTRIALIST who died without a written or oral
WILL attatched to the account. Since his death , I
personally has watched with keen interest to see the
next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has
come to claim his funds and no other person knows
about this account or anything concerning it,the 
account has no other beneficiary and until his death
he was the manager of his 
company.

The total amount involved is 48,223,000.00 USD.[ Forty
eight million two hundred and twenty three thousand
United States Dollar ]. We wish to start the first
transfer with $8,000,000.00[Eight million] and upon 
successful transaction without any disappointment from
your side, we shall re-apply for the transfer of the
remaining balance to your account.

I have secretly discussed this matter with the manager
of the bank who I must involve in order to have a
smooth and a successful transfer of the fund to any
foreign bank account which you are going to nominate.
On this note, I want you to act as the foreign
beneficiary of the fund from the deceased by providing
your bank account where the fund will be transferred
for immediate investment on any viable project as no
one has come up to be the next of kin.

The banking ethics here does not allow such money to
stay more than 2 years without claim hence the money
will be recalled to the government treasury as
unclaimed after this long period of domancy.

In view of this I got your contact through my personal
search to see if you can assist by providing your safe
bank account for the transfer or find a reliable
person who will be capable of receiving such amount in
his or her personal account.At the conclussion of the
transfer 65% of the fund will be for me, I will give
you 20% of the total transfer sum, 10% for charity 
both in Africa and in your country while the remaining
5% will be set aside to settle expenses both parties
might incure during the transfer process.

Upon the receipt of your reply, I will send to you a
detailed information about the transaction.I will not
fail to bring to your notice that this business is
100% risk and trouble free and that you should not 
entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer
can be finalized within 7 to 9 banking days, after you
apply to the bank as the beneficiary of the fund from
the deceased.

When you receive this letter. Kindly send me an e-mail
or you can call me or fax me. You should also include
your private fax and phone numbers for easy and safe
communication.

Respectfully yours,

Mr.J.Frances.

Apache, UW imapd (there is no such thing as "WU-IMAP" [*]), Postfix, 
stunnel, etc. are all servers.  It is useful at times for server 
certificates, particularly private keys, to be stored in a separate 
directory than public CA certificates.

Pine is a client, not a server.  As such, it needs access to Certificate 
Authority (CA) certificates in order to validate certificates.  It is 
sometimes necessary to be able to access a local public key if it is 
self-signed; but self-signing is inferior security practice to using a CA 
(if necessary, set up your own CA and install its certificate).

That is incorrect.

The SSLCERTS setting from the Pine build is passed down to the IMAP 
toolkit build, where it sets the server certificates location for impad 
and ipop3d.  That's what that line that writes an imap/SPECIALS file is 
all about.

Put another way, the SSLCERTS build parameter is to set the certificate 
path for the imapd and ipop3d servers that are built as part of the Pine 
build.

There are excellent reasons NOT to do this.  The entire purpose for 
setting SSLCERTS to a different location is to place server certificates 
(and especially the private keys) in a separate read-protected directory 
from the publicly-readable directory used by clients.

The only acceptable way to have a build-line parameter that would alter 
Pine's *client* certificate directory would be if it was a new parameter 
name that set the client certificate directory separately from the server 
certificate directory.

This would be a fair amount of work.  I question its utility compared to 
just building OpenSSL with its default certificate directory set to the 
desired directory for client certificates.

> Also one might have different trust for different application usage, and 
> hence want to trust different (number of) CAs for different applications.

I can't imagine how this would be useful, especially for Pine which can 
potentially be used to access a server anywhere in the world.  CA 
certificates are global in nature.

[*] imapd is a product of the University of Washington (UW) in Seattle,
     WA, USA.  To my knowledge, Washington University (WU) in St. Louis,
     MO, USA does not produce an IMAP server, although they do produce an
     highly-regarded FTP server.  Geographically, the two universities are
     thousands of kilometers apart.

That may be true, but when I build Pine I build Pine. When I build IMAP I 
download it and build it. So to me it looked like it was (and is) ignored 
by Pine itself.

How come? Don't you have all certificate authorization abstraced in one 
place?

Between different applications, not in Pine. I prefer not to re-symlink 
the system certs directory everytime a new application is to be run. With 
variant symlinks this would of course be possible, but variant symlinks 
are not available on my current Linux distribution.

But I can accept you won't do it. I'll dig into the code myself and locate 
the places where I have to change it to make it work with our system 
setup. The benefit of having access to the source, no less. Thanks for 
your time.

Are you really adding certificates for client programs, such as Pine?

Note that this proposed feature, if added, would require that all the 
Certificate Authority certificates be copied from Mac OS X's OpenSSL to 
the /usr/local copy.

Also note that if you install all of the latest version of OpenSSL into 
/usr/local, then you can use that version to build Pine.  In that case, 
the client certificates directory would be the directory of your choosing 
when you built OpenSSL, and Pine will get that version.

I realize that this is complicated and hard to understand -- it took me a 
long while to understand it myself!  But I think that as long as you use 
*only* your /usr/local version of OpenSSL with Pine (as opposed to 
building Pine with the System version of OpenSSL but expecting Pine to use 
the /usr/local files) then you will be OK.

Another reason for even having a user configurable (pinerc) option for 
this is if users want to trust their own CAs or self-signed certificates. 
The end-user may not have root access or the ability to re-compile OpenSSL 
(or install OpenSSL in their home directory and then compile their own 
Pine with that as well). A sysadmin may not want to centrally install each 
users trusted CAs/certificates.

And before you say there are only one set of trusted CAs, I can tell you 
that for example KDE comes with more trusted CAs (for Konquerer, etc) than 
OpenSSL (which it does not install by default). So there seems to be 
little consenses of the common CA set.

Self-signed certificates are inferior if you do not have any independent 
verification of them.

Other mail clients let me accept a self-signed certificate, which means 
that if I verify the certificate once, it is as safe as a certificate 
signed by a trusted CA.

The pine user might not be able to set any CA up, because the mailserver 
is controlled by someone else (e.g. IT department).


My request is that pine lets me accepts any certificate after presenting 
its fingerprint.

Hello,

Does pine have anything like "enable-vi-navigation"
so that hjkl-keys work like arrow keys, Ctrl-F and
Ctrl-B work like page-up/down, /<pattern> works
for WhereIs <pattern> etc.?

I have not been able to find any such think.  If pine
does support such a feature, how does one turn it on?

Thanks,

--Suresh

                        HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL 

Dear Sir/Madam,

Good Day And Compliment of season. 

I am Dr.Dominik Kabila {a Civil servant in the ministry of 
Health} here in Nigeria. I know this letter would come to 
you as a surprise because we have not met before either 
physically or through correspondence. I got your contact 
from our chamber of commerce here in Nigeria and have no 
doubt in your ability to handle this proposal involving 
huge sums of money. 

The Subject: My father Chief Micheal Kabila {Now late} was 
the Royal head of my community, Eleme {an Oil rich town} 
in Nigeria. My community produce 5.8% of the total annual 
Oil production in Nigeria and 0.5% of the Dollar value of 
each barrel is paid to my father as royalty by the federal 
government. In his position as the royal head and chairman 
of the Eleme Oil trust fund, he made some money which he 
kept behind for his children. The money is one hundred and 
twenty eight Million, Five Hundred thousand US Dollars 
{$128.5m}. This money originated from the accumulated 
royalties between 1998. Due to poor banking system in 
Nigeria and political/economic instability as a result of 
past military rules {1985-1999}, he deposited this money 
in a "Box" with an open beneficiary in a security Vault.In 
the name of a foreign firm. He told the security Company 
that the content of the box is Gold worth [$128.5m] And 
the box will be safeguarded until he finishes arrangement 
to transfer it abroad. He was planning this when he died 
last year of heart Attack. 

The Proposal: Just before my father died, he called my 
attention in confidence to the money and charged me to 
look for a foreigner who would assist me in the 
transfer/investment of the fund. So I would be very 
grateful if you could accept to help me achieve this great 
objective. I promise to give you 25% of total fund 
transferred as compensation for your assistant. Five 
percent {5%} will be set aside to take care of all 
expenses we may incur during the transaction. To indicate 
your interest, contact me urgently and confidentially for 
more information and the roles you will play in the 
transaction. I will like if you to add your phone/fax 
number on your reply for easy contact. 
Always reply your mail via my private email box 
dominik3@gawab.com.

God bless you.
  
Dominik Kabila, 
For the family.

I was looking for vi-emulation not while entering text but
while navigating the various "menu/control" windows of pine.
I have since learnt (from Eduardo Chappa) that this cannot
be done (and also that pine does not support reconfiguration
of keystrokes).

Hi!

I have two questions (maybe feature requests) regarding file-name
completion.  I should add that I am using PC-Pine 4.60 under Windows
2000.

1) Is there a way to get file-name completion to work for the fcc
    field when composing a message?  This would be very useful.  I have
    been using pine for many years, and that would be my number one
    feature request, if there isn't already a way to do this.  (I know
    about the ^T command, but that is too slow for my taste.  Also, it
    does not work too well for me in directories with many mail
    folders.)

2) When I use file-name completion (e.g., when saving a message), pine
    automatically appends a "/" at the end of the file's name
    (reslting, say in "myfile/", but does not let me save to "myfile/",
    giving me the error message

               "Folder "myfile/" doesn't exist.  Create?

    I have to manually delete the "/" to sucessfully save the message
    to the file "myfile".  Is there a way to tell pine not to append
    "/" at the end of the file name?

Thanks for any pointers!
Yours,

Nikolaus Vonessen

While reading the help on alt-addresses I didnt see anything about patten
matching addresses.

I have multiple sendmail aliases
(either  sbirl+DamnSpammers@concept.temple.edu  or  test@concept.temple.edu)
and would like an easier way to have Pine to detect them instead of
entering them all in.


Thanks
Birl

I have the same problem when trying to save messages to another
mailbox on Mac OS X..  Pine 4.56 running on my personal acct (on "SunOS"
which I think is Solaris?) doesn't have this problem.  My main acct only
started doing this a few years ago, AFAIK..  So it may be a server issue,
I still think pine should work around the problem.

Greetings,

I just upgraded to 4.60 from 4.44 and am getting used to the many new 
features. One feature seems to be troubling me.

When viewing messages in pine 4.44, they'd all wrap properly at 74 
characters. 4.60 seems to wrap arbitrarily, depending on how big the xterm 
I'm in seemd to be.

I've set quell-flowed-text to prevent this from happening on messages *I* 
create. Now how do I prevent this on messages other people send me?

In other words, referencing RFC 2646, how do I *VIEW* messages in 
Format=Fixed even if they were composed in Format=Flowed (like I could do 
in the good 'ole days with pine 4.44).

-Chuck

funny you should ask. there's no option to do this in pine 4.60...but, 
like you, i wasn't satisfied with that. so, i wrote a patch to provide 
just such an option. it's here:

Outstanding, thank you very much. Only one problem though, whenever I 
click on the link to get the patch, I get a message that says:

"Redirection limit for this URL exceeded. Unable to load requested page. 
This may be caused by cookies that are blocked."

I checked, and I'm not blocking any cookies.

Any chance you could send me the patch directly?

sorry...i occasionally play at being a sysadmin, which causes problems, 
since i'm not a very good one. :P

Ryan, thanks for that. Came through just fine. I've taken the liberty of 
patching the pine 4.60 source with your patch and rolling the patched 
version into RPM and DEB packages. Binary and source versions are 
included. I've posted them here:

I just tried to create a rule so when I reply to the openvpn-users 
mailing list, my reply should automatically set the To: header to the 
list-addr. However, when I try to reply to a mail using this rule, pine 
stops with a segfault.

I'm using Pine v4.60 on Slackware Linux 9 system.

Here is the rule I've created:

LIT:pattern="/NICK=Mail to openvpn-users@lists.sourceforge.net/
TO=openvpn-users@lists.sourceforge.net/FLDTYPE=EMAIL"action="/
ROLE=1/CSTM=To: 
openvpn-users@lists.sourceforge.net/RTYPE=YES/FTYPE=YES/CTYPE=NO"

Please let me know how I can debug this further or if I need to provide 
more info.

Here is the last output from .pine-debug running pine -d 9:

There are some tests in the code which *can* look at uninitialized variables 
that may cause a crash.  Eduardo Chappa's unofficial patched version of 4.60 
has the fix for this (http://www.math.washington.edu/~chappa/pine/ ).  I 
believe the the Pine team mentioned on the Pine newsgroup (comp.mail.pine) 
that the problem would be corrected in the next release.  The problem is (I 
believe) in pine/send.c where there are tests for if(*pf->addr) which should 
be if(pf->addr && *pf->addr) (to be safe).

By the way, Before I discovered the NULL pointer problem in the code itself, 
I found a workaround for my setup was to use CC: instead of To:, but that 
may not work for you.

We have a server running Pine 4.5.1.  In spite of many experiments, I've 
been unable to help a user who is getting a lot of spam with a Subject 
line of the form "$12345" (string of digits).  Any way to specify a "$" 
in a filter rule?  Thanks.

Try using $$ instead of $. All pine variables go through enviroment 
variable expansion, so $var is used for that. I don't have a pine 4.51 
handy to try it there, but it works in current version.

Thanks to both Steves.  I'd tried double dollars because of the 
environment variable comments in the new-in-4.60 document, but what it 
appears to do is cause the $-subject mail to completely disappear, never 
apparently arriving in the inbox or in the filter-target folder.

Oddly, though I'd tried \$ earlier and had it fail, one of my 
colleagues, unaware of the test, suggested I try it, and when I did, it 
worked.  Who knows why these things happen....  Thanks again for the 
assistance offered!

It will fail the next time that you edit any filter. Try version 4.60, and 
let us know if it works for you.

Well, I'd created another dummy filter just to experiment with 
shuffling, since my user said the \$ didn't work for him.  I went back 
and changed the To:-line pattern in that filter and tried another test 
with a $-sign, and it filtered OK.  Why were you expecting it not to work?

Dick

PS: Unfortunately this pine is on a Unix server serving a lot of people 
at the University, and the system staff aren't always crazy about 
upgrading software, especially (and, from experience, rightfully so) 
newly released versions.  So experimenting with 4.60 is not going to be 
relevant for a while.

I recall a bug in which a rule with a "$" sign would be omitted from the

hi,

I have updated the original smime patch for pine which can be found in the
current pine source tree under contrib/smime.  it works for me using
cygwin, but not using linux/debian (so far, I have only tested with
incoming smime messages, as I am planning to use something based on the
external scripts produced by thorsten glaser for outgoing smime messages).

my patch can, together with much more *nix-related information, be found
at: http://godot.studentenweb.org/debian/index_bw.cgi#pinesmime

the pine-info archive
http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/2004.01/msg00055.html mentions
the existance of an smime patch finetuned for 4.58 which is claimed to
solve some old bugs and add a few new features, but the site which should
provide more information seems to be down.

is there anyone out there who could provide me with a copy of that patch
against version 4.58?

many thanks, danny.

Super. But it would probably had been better if you coordinated with 
Martin Kouril (Kouril period Martin with seznam period cz) who has been 
working hard on getting his very much improved patch to work with 4.60 and 
OpenSSL 0.9.7d. His patch has lots of bugfixes, time server support and 
support for preference settings.

His site seems down now actually, it was up not many days ago. I have a 
local copy of smime-patch-for-pine4.58.20040508.diff I could send over if 
you want to. I'll send it in a private email as I am unsure if this lists 
accepts attachments.

That patch worked really well with both incoming and outgoing messages for 
Pine 4.58. What it could have needed was support to select the key 
depending on From header, now it selects the key based on your master 
address (i.e. it uses the master address even if you override it with a 
role to find the key in your home directory).

I'm using a pine account for approving messages for a majordomo list. 
Since upgrading to 4.6 many of the approved messages are rejected by 
majordomo. The problem seems to be that when I forwarded a message to 
majordomo using 4.58, it would be sent with:
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=X-UNKNOWN
But when I forward the same message using Pine 4.6 it gets sent as:
Content-Type: MULTIPART/MIXED; BOUNDARY="0-848703117-1089550477=:11690"
Might there be a configuration setting within 4.6 that I can change to 
be sure that the messages are sent as TEXT/PLAIN?
Thanks,
 Stephen Ronan

In trying to use this, in version 4.44 running on Red Ht Linux 7.3, 
going via a Postfix SMTP server, I get the response " This server does 
not allow Delivery Status Notification", or some such response.

However, I appear to get successful sending of return rexeipt requests, 
when using Mozilla Messenger mail. I have just checked, and my settings 
for Mozilla messenger, use the same SMTP server as my PINE email 
application.

This is using DSNOpts which displays at the bottom of the screen, when 
pressing <CTRL><X>, then D for DSNOpts, then S for Success, then Y for 
<Yes>, to send, in PINE.

So, Delivery Status Notification appears to not work in PINE version 
4.44, or, for me, anyway.

In checking, the above response to my request, was the only response 
that I appear to have received to the feature request.

Does this mean that the feature exists in later versions of PINE (than 
version 4.44), or that using a different editor to the default (which 
from memory is pico), will enable the features in the response, both in 
composing messges and, in traversing lists of messages within a folder, 
and, the message folders?

expunges them. The message then shows as D(eleted) in the mail index (it 
does not disappear). When I now switch folder (for example to INBOX), Pine 
wants to expunge the deleted message (which no longer exists in the 
mailbox) and dies with this in the debug-file:

     ---- FOLDER LISTER ----
About to open folder "INBOX"    inbox is: "INBOX"
expunge_and_close: "henrik.edlund.org"
Want_to read: y (121)
about to end_tty_driver
Pine Panic: Received abort signal(sig=11)

(If I leave the folder answering no to the expunge questions, Pine does 
not die.)

Known bug?

Also, shouldn't Pine thanks to the MBX format mailbox notice the message 
has been expunged? Why does it show as deleted?

Since which version has Pine supported sending-filters with the _MIMETYPE_ 
variable?

   _MIMETYPE_
       When the command is executed, this token is replaced in the command
       name with a temporary file name used to accept any new MIME
       Content-Type information necessitated by the output of the filter.
       Upon the filter's exit, if the file contains new MIME type
       information, Pine verifies its format and replaces the outgoing
       message's MIME type information with that contained in the file.
       This is basically a cheap way of sending something other than
       Text/Plain.

Dick,

 Here's a trick that should work, regardless of which version of Pine you 
are using. Define the subkect field as:

	=?utf-8?Q?=24?=

that's equivalent to a peso ($) sign.

If that would work with a "$" symbol, could you please also give the 
required equivalents, for the "!", "?", "|", and "." symbols? These 
are also prevalent in subject lines of spam messages, and the "." 
and "|" symbols are used to fragment alphabetic character strings, such 
as words, to defeat spam filters.

Thank you in anticipation.

I don't think you need those codes, you can enter them directly, however, 
if you really think this is the way to do it, replace the "=24" above 
(which is the code of the $ sign) by the ascii code of the character that 
you want.

For example, at www.asciitable.com, you will see that a "$" sign has 
associated the number "24" under the Hx column, "!" is 21, "|" is 7C, and 
so on.

(please don't top-post)

If you're using regular mail delivery on your system, you should be able to 
just compile a new pine and use it for yourself.  (On my personal account,
they don't use "regular" mail delivery, I think they use qmail, which
requires a big hassle each time to get a new pine up and running.)  But if
you're just using IMAP for example to access your mail, you could just
compile a new one.

Does anyone have an icon for pine that I can attach to an Applescript file 
that starts up Pine from the desktop?  Or is there a way with OS X to 
convert the icons in contrib so they can be pasted in to the "Get Info" 
panel that manages OS X icons?

I just recently upgraded to 4.60 and I'm having the same problem.  What
do you mean by 'the next time you come into the folder'?  I've tried
switching to a different folder then switching back, but the filter
doesn't apply.  The only way I'm able to get the filter to apply is by
exiting and restarting pine.  I would prefer to not do this as I tend to
leave pine running all the time (in a screen session).

Would it be possible to make this functionality a tunable feature in
the next version?

Thanks,
Tony

Hi all. I've written a patch that removes trailing quotes from 
compositions:

http://snarfed.org/space/pine+remove+trailing+quote+patch

If you try to observe decent netiquette, and quote the smallest relevant 
piece of emails when you reply, you often need to trim a lot of extra 
quoted text. This is especially true if you correspond with people who 
(ick) top-post. This patch automates the drudgery of trimming that excess 
quoted text.

The patch adds an option that removes quoted text if it's the last text in 
the message, except for (possibly) your signature. At the "Send message?" 
prompt, it removes the trailing quote so you can see what the trimmed 
composition will look like before you send. If you cancel, it replaces the 
trailing quote. It also provides a keystroke to remove trailing quotes 
manually. Enjoy!

-Ryan

*** Hi,

I have built pine4.60 with new chappa patches again and the filter on 
expunge works but only in one case:

I have rule "if message is not recent (is not new)"

If I set the status of the message using "*!n" (change status, not, new), 
then try to expunge, it doesn't filter. If I leave the folder and go into 
other folder and then go back, message is not still filtered.

If I read the message (status has changed to NOT new), then I do expunge 
and message is filtered.

Any ideas if this is OK or error?

Bye 

Wolf.

Pine 4.60, just upgraded on a new box (we=20
switched over within the same ISP) from 4.45.=20
Using a Mac with DataComet-Secure as terminal=20
program, which I quite recommend.

Previously, I could always type accents (as with=20
Option-e e for =E9). Now it gives me "[ Unknown=20
Command ]." I don't recall changing anything=20
charset-related in Pine prefs, and, apart from=20
server name, DataComet is unchanged.

What could be going wrong?

BTW, f=3Df seems to be working adequately.=20
Sometimes it adds spurious quoted lines to ends=20
of messages, though.

I thought I had managed to compile pine 4.60 on mac os x (10.2.8) with
an updated version of openssl installed in /usr/local/... I did this by
feeding in the config flags for the openssl certificate, include,
library etc. directories. I also did some correcting by hand after
configuring and before making.

This obviously isn't enough, since pine is compiled to use the default
openssl despite my configuration attempts. Can anybody tell me what more
is necessary to ensure pine compiles with the updated installation of
openssl?

Thanks,

Here is one of the release notes for pine 4.61. Maybe this will fix your 
problem.

     Relaxed conditions which caused a filter to not be reevaluated before
     expunging if the user changed flags manually. Now only a manual
     Undelete may cause the filter to not be reevaluated before expunging.

Hi, All, 
I'm using Pine 4.60 and have my normal index set for status msgno 
smarttime init subject(100%).
I have no problems with this, works great. 
But when I sort by threads, the index-format changes to what's close to 
the defaults, with a thread-indicator character or the number of 
messages in parenthesis. 
Is there a way (hopefully an easy one) to get the same index-format when 
reading threads? 
I'm using mutt-like threads and sorting by ordered-subject. 
Thanks,
--Rick

Just noticed that inside threads, (using

just not in the message index itself.

If you use one of the threading-index-styles that starts with "separate" 
so that it says THREAD INDEX instead of MESSAGE INDEX at the top of the 
screen, you can't control the format of that THREAD INDEX page. Sorry.

Hi,

Im try to figure out how to use these Keywords to create a new flags
and how to use them later on (Pine 4.60). My idea was to mark some
messages with these new flags using keywords automatically, but so far without a
succes.

Can somebody explain me how these things working?

Regards,
Murphy

Hi,

anyone can check this error?

If started pine4.61 compiled with Chappa all patch, there is a warning

"[Sort type "date" is invalid]"

This warning disappear when I add in pinerc value "thread" or "arrival" 
(different than date) into thread-sort-key. There is default value "date" 
for this but probably some patch destroyed the functionality for "date" in 
thread-sort-key options.

There is no warning in pine 4.61 without chappa patch.


Wolf.

The Chappa fancy (threading) patch adds thread-sort-key option. It used to 
support all the options of sort-key, but we had some discussion about bad 
usability with having options that does nothing (subject, from, to, etc) 
and options that does the same as another option (date same as thread). So 
the fancy patch now (part of all.patch) only takes "arrival" and "thread" 
(Pine default thread sort without patch) as thread-sort-key.

So either change "date" to "thread" in .pinerc, or if Pine can be started, 
change it in the Config.

Hi list. This is my first post.

I was a avid Pine user years ago. It's nice to see the Windows
version has added some GUI elements (to make it a bit more
modern). But I prefer the faster TUI interface.

Now I'd like to build PC-Pine with MingW (making my own makefile
if I have to). Anybody built it with MingW/gcc 3.3 lately? 

Just briefly skimming through the source/makefiles, I cannot find the 
resource files anywhere (the .rc-files that makes up the menus etc.).
Where are they; do they get generated? 

I downloaded the latest pine.tar.bz2 expecting everything needed for 
building it, to be there. Maybe not..

I'm trying to build Pine 4.61 on my HP/UX 11.22 box and ran into the
following error:

ar: creating libpico.a
        : libpico.a
        gcc   -g -DDEBUG  -Dhpp -DJOB_CONTROL -DPOSIX -DMOUSE -c main.c
        gcc   -g -DDEBUG  -Dhpp -DJOB_CONTROL -DPOSIX -DMOUSE main.o libpico.a  -ltermcap -lV3 -o pico
ld: Can't find library or mismatched ABI for -ltermcap
Fatal error.
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
*** Error exit code 1

Stop.

The command used to do the build was './build NOSSL ghp'.  Is there a
problem or is this another HP/UX compatibility issue between HP/UX 10 and
11i?  Thank in advance.

Dear Pinesters,

I didn't use PC-Pine 4.60 since it crashed when opening any mailbox
without a network connection available (#move INBOX) and when exiting
after delete or delete/expunge. I stayed on 4.58 instead.

Today I installed 4.61 and found both problems fixed plus noticeably
increased filtering speed. Excellent!

Thanks a lot to all who have contributed!

Cheers from goudy old Germany,

Possible the help text shown at the end of this message, in 4.61, could be 
improved and possible split in two options, reply-indent-string and 
display-indent-string.

If I reply to a quoted messages with "> > >" (in Message Text view) Pine 
will render this as ">>>" in the Composer. Well, ">>>" is what Pine must 
send in order to follow the RFC for flowed text, but it is not what was in 
the original email. Maybe this conversion when doing reply is okay, maybe 
it is not, I am not sure myself how I feel about it at this stage. (But 
when sending, any "> > >" must be converted to ">>>" before handing off to 
MTA if flowed text.)

Thing now is, that when I get an incoming flowed message with ">>>", Pine 
will convert this to "> > >" before displaying it in Message Text view. 
This is where I want display-indent-string (or maybe 
display-quote-string?) to come in. If I set this option to "| " then Pine 
would convert the ">>>" to "| | | " before display (but it would still be 
">>>" in the message source saved on disk).

If we go back to the second paragraph above and my question to myself if 
it was correct of Pine to show ">>>" in the Composer. Maybe it is here 
Pine should use the reply-indent-string ("> " per default). It should 
render the message I reply to with "> > >" or "| | |" if that is what I 
set reply-indent-string to. Before the message is handed off to the MTA, 
then Pine should convert all "reply-indent-string" into ">" so that the 
message is in conformance with the flowed text RFC.

What do you think?

--- snip ---

                           OPTION: Reply-Indent-String

This option specifies an aspect of Pine's Reply command. When a message
is replied to and the text of the message is included, the included text
usually has the string "> " prepended to each line indicating it is
quoted text. (In case you haven't seen this before, "string" is a
technical term which means chunk of text.)

The implicit conversion from "> > >" to ">>>" when replying also causes 
problems when using the ^V NoFlow option of ^X Send. As Pine changed all 
the "> > >" into ">>>", if NoFlow is enabled, the message sent in Fixed 
format will now actually have ">>>" and not "> > >" (as in original 
message). I think this is a bug.

It seems to me the conversion from pine-indent-string to 
format-flowed-indent-string should take place when the message is actually 
sent, after we know if the user finally choose Flow or NoFlow.

Also, is it possible so that the help text for reply-indent-string that 
today states that if one changes it, the message will not be flowed, 
should then really be: ''If the message is sent using flowed text, the 
indent string specified here will simply be ignored and internally 
converted to the standard ">" before message is sent. If you choose NoFlow 
just before sending, even if flowed text is turned on by default, this 
string will still be used though.''

Hello Wolf,

 I am sorry about this. I had fixed this error (in fact it's not in the 
"fancy" patch), but I forgot to fix it in the "all patch". It is now 
fixed. Sorry about that.

Ah, that's why I could not replicate it with my fancy.patch so I could 
give Wolf a patch. (I don't use all.patch.)

Here's a strange one for you.  I'm running Pine under Tru64 UNIX version 
4.0E.  For years I've been able to select mail folders based on the 
presence of unseen messages and zoom (;PUZ is the sequence).  Now, since 
I've built and installed 4.61, this doesn't work anymore.  Any ideas?

How doesn't it work?. Do you have enabled [X] enable-aggregate-cmd-set?

Yup.  It seems to only work intermittently if my current folder has a new 
message in it and it only selects that folder.  My configuration files 
haven't changed at all; this worked fine this morning before I migrated 
from 4.58 to 4.61.

I have a certain email where the URL detection fails..

The URL is similar to:

http://a.b.com/X/Y/whatever.php?whatever=number

And the URL detection only selects up through the ?

However, I can't reproduce it.  Even copying/pasting the EXACT URL into a new
mail to myself doesn't show the problem.  But in the original email, it happens
every time.  (4.61, but I'm almost positive I've seen this before)

If you view this message with full headers, do you get the same problem? 
There are ways to generate a special type of flowed message where this 
would happen, but if the highlight didn't work with full headers then that 
would be a problem I'm not familiar with.

Is this problem new to 4.61?

Thanks,
Jeff

Yes, the problem happens with full headers.  But I do see that with full
headers, it shows up like

http://url?
whatever=whatevernum

So the part after the question mark shows up on a separate line _in full header
mode_.  (I even made my window very wide just to make sure that didn't have
anything to do with it.)

> Is this problem new to 4.61?

As I said above, I didn't think so.. but I did run the 4.60 I had and 
confirmed, the problem is not new.

hi,

after having received the smime patch for pine4.58 from henrik, I slightly 
changed it to make it work with pine4.61.  next to this version 
synchronization, I have corrected and extended some user interface 
features to improve the signer's (certificate) details.

I successfully tested it with cygwin, linux (redhat and debian) and with 
osf1.  if you should experience problems (e.g., segmentation faults when 
pressing ctrl-e when trying to view a signer's details), you might 
consider recompiling openssl (with time stamping support) and the patched 
pine itself using gcc-2.95.

the patch and detailed installation instructions can be found here: 
http://godot.studentenweb.org/debian/index_bw.cgi#pinesmime

That's the scenario I was talking about.  What the generating client did 
is a gray area in the spec wrt its use of delsp.  It appears that they 
aren't using delsp for its intended purpose.  Therefore, we are doing the 
safest (and easiest) thing in treating the two lines as separate entities 
and not treating them as part of the same URL.  We will keep our eye out 
for clarifications on this behavior, though.

Do you have more specifics?

The "generating client" is Apple's Mail.app.  I could write up a bug on
the area.. I just don't know the details.

I know you said gray area.. but it still might be worth a bug.

DEPARTMENT OF MINERALS AND ENERGY
PRETORIA, 
SOUTH AFRICA.

Kindly reply:thomasmbuso2@mail2southafrica.com

Dear Friend,
It is my great pleasure to write you this letter on behalf
of my colleagues.I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you 
in the execution of a deal hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope 
you will keep it confidential because of the nature of the business.Within the 
Department of Minerals and Energy where I work as an Assistant Director of 
Audit,with the co-operation of two other top officials,we have in our 
possession an overdue contractor payment in US Dollars funds.The said funds 
represent certain percentage of the contract value executed on behalf of my 
Department by a foreign contracting firm,(Pearls Ltd) which we the officials 
over-invoiced to the amount of US$15,200,000 (Fifteen Million Two Hundred 
Thousand US Dollars).Since the present elected Government is determined to pay
foreign contractors all debts owed,so as to maintain good relations
with foreign governments and non-governmental agencies,we included our
bills for approvals with the Department of Finance and the Reserve
Bank of South Africa (RBSA).We are 100% sure of funds approvals to
anyone or company we (The Audit Committee) recommend as part of the 
sub-contractors who did jobs for the Department. We are seeking your 
assistance to front as the sub-contractor of the unclaimed funds,since we are 
not allowed to operate foreign accounts.Details and change of beneficiary 
information upon application for claim to reflect payment and approvals will 
be secured on behalf of you/your Company.
My colleagues and I are prepared to give you US$2.5m while we take US$7.4m and 
the balance of US$5.3m for taxes and miscellaneous expenses incurred.
This business is completely safe and secure,provided you treat it with
utmost confidentiality.It does not matter whether you/your Company does
contract projects,as a transfer of rights will be secured in favour of
you/your Company through the Federal High Court of South Africa before
we can proceed.
I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint 
us.Kindly notify me immediately via my alternative email 
(thomasmbuso2@mail2southafrica.com) for further details upon your acceptance 
of this proposal.

Yours Faithfully,
Thomas Mbuso (Mr)
NB:Please contact me via(thomasmbuso2@mail2southafrica.com)

Hello, I've been using pine as my chosen mail-reader for so long that I
almost can't remember using anything else of my own free will.

I'm currently using it at home on a multi-boot PC where I've got pine
4.60 installed on Fedora Core 1 & Fedora Core 2 & pine 4.58 on Mandrake
9.1. I mostly do my mail/news reading while in FC2.

When I joined Fedora's mailing list I found that I simply had to start
filtering my mail somehow. I chose to learn to use pine's filtering
capabilities. Which worked well on my local folders. 

I also use pine to import mail from my various non-local inboxes. which
currently amount to several pop accounts on one ISP's pop server. I
also use it for some newsgroups. 

The problems arose when I decided to use pines filters to selectively
move mail & newsgroup messages based on a specific incoming folder.

Problem # 1 of 2) I discovered that: Specific incoming folders didn't
differentiate between separate pop inbox folders...

when I selected any ONE of the pop accounts as a specific incoming
folder in the current folder type portion of a filter rule, the rule
would actually be applied to ANY of the three pop accounts...

For example, consider this extract from my ~/.pinerc which, if I
understand the help text, should cause mail from anyone in my
addressbook(s) to be moved to the local folder appropriate for which mail
account they sent to... 

 	LIT:pattern="/NICK=KnownSender_W/FLDTYPE=SPEC/FOLDER=W1LDcard/AFROM=YES" action="/FILTER=1/FOLDER=\/home\/jtwdyp\/mail\/KnownToWildcard/NOKILL=1",
 	LIT:pattern="/NICK=KnownSender_J/FLDTYPE=SPEC/FOLDER=jtwdyp/AFROM=YES" action="/FILTER=1/FOLDER=\/home\/jtwdyp\/mail\/KnownToJtwdyp/NOKILL=1",
 	LIT:pattern="/NICK=KnownSender_S/FLDTYPE=SPEC/FOLDER=spamen0t/AFROM=YES" action="/FILTER=1/FOLDER=\/home\/jtwdyp\/mail\/KnownToSpamen0t/NOKILL=1",

In practice mail from anybody in the addressbook(s) sending mail to the
pop accounts associated with the  "jtwdyp" and "spamen0t" incoming
folders were being moved to the "KnownToWildcard" local folder...

This problem didn't happen when I tested the sorting rule on three local
folders. 

I checked the pine 4.58 installed to my Mandrake linux, and it did the
same thing...

Is there something I'm misunderstanding here or shouldn't I be able to
sort mail having otherwise the same characteristics to different local
folders based on which remote pop server inbox they are being moved
from???

("Yeah, I know I could catch "most" of them via the To: header, but
believe it or not I get "SOME" mail sent to me with missing To: & Cc:
header lines that don't meet my personal description of spam.  And in
those cases I "_really_" want to be aware of which mailbox they are
sending it to...)

I suppose I can take the time to do a MSRF{select appropriate filter}$UEY
to reorder the KnownSender* rules so that the appropriate one is found
first before each/every time I open an pop account incoming folder, But
that is a REAL pain in the orifice.

Is there a more reasonable way I can accomplish this?

 - - - - - - - - -< s n i p >- - - - - - - - - -
 
Problem # 2 of 2) I discovered that: Specific incoming (News) folders
sometimes get applied to the local INBOX.

When I simply wanted to import all the "new" messages from a subscribed
newsgroup to a local folder where further processing could be
accomplished much more quickly {yeah I know this "COULD" be done by way
of running my own local news spool, but I would want chron to help me
manage that, And you never know when I'll be running a different linux,
or win98se or even have reason to powerdown this personal PC when the
chron job should start... So personal mail folders work better for me}

Anyway, the long and the short of it is as long as I didn't mind any
local linux INBOX messages being moved to the local fedora folder, this
worked:
	LIT:pattern="/NICK=SpecificNewsIfFedoraNewsGgroupToFedora-Now/FLDTYPE=SPEC/FOLDER={news.gmane.org\/nntp}#news.gmane.linux.redhat.fedora.general/STATD=NO" action="/FILTER=1/FOLDER=\/home\/jtwdyp\/mail\/fedora-now/NOKILL=1",

But since I like to keep local linux mail (such as messages sent to me
by one of my bash scripts...) in my INBOX until I deal with them I
played with it until I found that simply by adding a extra header field
to the rule (specifically "Newsgroups:") I could prevent this from being
applied to the INBOX folder even if I left it blank.

	LIT:pattern="/NICK=SpecificNewsIfFedoraNewsGgroupToFedora-Now/ARBNewsgroups=/FLDTYPE=SPEC/FOLDER={news.gmane.org\/nntp}#news.gmane.linux.redhat.fedora.general/STATD=NO" action="/FILTER=1/FOLDER=\/home\/jtwdyp\/mail\/fedora-now/NOKILL=1",


The thing is, Once I added that extra header field, I don't see anything
to even suggest that the messages in INBOX are bing checked for
anything. But when I tried the 1st version of the rule I couldn't open
INBOX without dumping it's contents into fedora-now...

Is this a known problem or a fluke? Simply adding that header seams to
have solved it for me, but I'm curious if anyone could tell me why this
happened?

Thanks!

There appears to be a bug with the 'show full header' command introduced in 
Pine 4.61  (Possibly in 4.60, but definetely not before that).

If you show full headers on a message, and then hit n or p to go to next or 
previous message.. it no longer shows the headers, and you have to hit 'h' 
again to show the headers. I'm not sure when that functionality broke, but 
it's a real pain to compare headers when you have to hit the h command each 
time when cycling messages.

I think it would be good if this feature operated differently based on 
context.  For example, if full headers are turned on by the user while 
looking at the mail index, then each message viewed in that index defaults 
to full header.  If it is turned on in the message, then it follows the new 
way of toggling header mode off after moving to the next message.

I agree with you on that. that was the first thing I tried, thinking maybe 
they changed it to be that way. But doesn't seem to be the case. Did you 
confirm on your OSX box the same behavior?

You should probably bother and read the release notes for 4.61:

  *  The behavior of the HdrMode Command has changed slightly. It now
     reverts back to normal mode when you switch to a new message. It also
     has an additional state if Quote-Suppression-Threshold is turned on.
  *  The old behavior of the HdrMode Command can be restored by not
     setting the Quote-Suppression-Threshold and setting the new feature
     Quell-Full-Header-Auto-Reset

Features like this shouldn't be turned on by default in an upgrade.. Just my 
.02..  Should have it as a new option, so people who "bother" to read the 
release notes, can enable it if they want to.

Flowed text went default _on_ in 4.60 as well.

It's not the first time.

I can't put wildcards in patterns, right?  From the online help it doesn't
look so.

I'd love to be able to catch:

http://*.org/

because it seems like the only spam I'm getting into my work account is ".org"
porn spam.

I tried adding just ".org" to an existing filter I've got but somehow it
matched a whole bunch of messages (I picked one or two of them, and the w
command couldn't see .org in the message).

No, you can't use wildcards in a Pine pattern but you could 
create Pine filter that uses an

  External Categorizer Commands

and the external categorizer (e.g. grep) could use wild cards. To 
learn about External Categorizer Commands, go to MSRF and read 
the relevant help. I think this was introduced in 4.60.

Hope this helps,

I think you should've read the release notes, but I agree with this part.

I think that feature changes for the most part shouldn't be pushed on people.

Unless perhaps pine could figure out that someone doesn't have a lot of
changes from the previous defaults, then maybe setting some currently-favored
preferences would be reasonable.

Is there any way to have the tab key do completion in the message

Is there a way to select a set of attachments and 
save them?

Someone sent me a file with a couple hundred attachments 
(instead of a single zip with them all in *Sigh*)  I couldn't
find a way to select all of them to save in a single command 
or select a subset of them to save. 

Was I just missing it somewhere  (in pine 4.60)?

Not really. The best you can do in Pine4.61 is to save all attachments at 
once. This is done as part of the export command. In fact, if you have a 
message that has attachments, then pressing "E" to export it, will show a 
key in the menu "^P", which when pressed will make Pine save all 
attachments included in the message in one directory.

The name of the directory is obtained from the name of the file where you 
will export your message by adding a ".d" suffix.

Hello,

I try to make some usage of the "keywords" in the Pine 4.61 on NetBSD
2.0F, but this does not working. :(

I set the keyword in the setup screen like this:

     keywords                       = S

then I try to mark some message using this keyword, but the only thing
which is happening is the message:

     Cannot add keywords for this folder

I try to do this for a different folders and still the same result.
Can somebody tell me what is wrong with this keywords?

Regards,
Murphy

Hi,

I have a problem regarding PINE's attempt to automatically use CRAM-MD5
when the server advertises it:

My own mailserver has a few accounts, which do not support CRAM-MD5 among
a majority of other ones (basically all shell accounts). I have decided to
keep the CRAM-MD5 in the capabilities of the IMAP server, as more then 95%
of the users can use it, and the remaining 5% are all people that can deal
with the situation, such as me ;-).

Regarding Pine, (tested with 4.58), the disable-these-authenticators
directive in the .pinerc works fine in general. I run into troubles while
using a remote pinerc with the -p command line switch. Of course, the
disable... config directive in my local .pinerc is now ommited, so I have
tried adding the same directive at the commandline (using
- -disable-these-authenticators=CRAM-MD5) and into the systemwide pinerc
(using the line "disable-these-authenticators=CRAM-MD5"). Neither of the
two actually did change the behavoir of PINE when trying to load the
remote configuration.

Here are the parts that seem to be interesting from a -d 7 log file:

- ---cut---
  Global config:     /usr/local/lib/pine.conf
  Personal config:   {localhost/user=torben}INBOX.internal.pine.remote_pinerc
...

- ---cut---

I can verify this behavoir both with 4.58 and 4.61.

Are there any other ways of getting this working? Perhaps a hidden command
to influence the authenticator used per-server? It seems like a bug to
me, that the global configuration is ignored at this point. Or did I miss
something really trivial ?


Live long and prosper!

FROM DR.MIKE ASIEKE
DIRECTOR INCHARGE OF 
AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT,
CONTINENTAL TRUST BANK,
COTONOU-BENIN REPUBLIC
 
ATTN: MY FRIEND
 
Pleasure writing to you at this moment of the day, I am DR.MIKE ASIEKE, 
the director incharge of auditing and accounting Unit of Continental 
Trust Bank in Cotonou-Benin Republic. I and my colleagues deem it fit 
to contact you regarding to a transaction that will favour both of us 
at the end, and i got your contact in my search for a reputable and 
reliable person to help me claim the fund in question.
 
We discovered the sum of eight million one hundred thousand United 
States Dollars (USD8.1M) belonging to a deceased customer of this bank. 
The fund has been lying in a suspence account without anybody coming to 
put claim over the money since the account owner late Mr. Mohamed Mohd  
from libanon, who was involved in the December 25th Benin plane crash. 
Here is the air crash  website= 
http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/12/26/benin.crash/index.html
The said fund is now ready for transfer to a foriegn account whose 
owner will be portrayed as the beneficiary and next of kin to the 
deceased customer of the bank. 
 
The foriegn account owner will impost himself as the next of kin to the 
deceased and respond positively like a true next of kin who wishes to 
speed up the release and transfer of his inherited fund. If the over 
due fund if not claimed by the end of next quarter, the government of 
the Federal Republic of Benin will take over the ownership of the fund 
in line with the Federal Edict Act of 1979. We do not want the 
government to take over the ownership of this money, that is why I 
contacted you for us to do the deal together, so that we will portray 
you as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased whose name is Mr. 
Mohamed mohd.
 
If you accept to carry out this project with us, we will offer you 30% 
of the total sum, while I and my colleagues involved will take 70% of 
the total sum.Upon your acceptance to do this deal with us, we will 
jointly effect the transfer within eight working days.
 Be rest assured that, this transaction carries no risk and no extra 
responssibilities on your part, except the above mentioned roles and 
normally you will be required to maintain absolute information and
absolute secrecy throughout the duration of this transaction, because 
discussing it with a third party might jeopardise the entire 
transaction. 
 
I am looking forward to receiving your interesting response on this 
project as this will greatly enrich the both of us at the end. please 
You may contact me throughmy private  email: or phone 
mike_asieke1@yahoo.co.uk
 
BEST REGARDS,

Hiya,

I remember this being discussed earlier but didn't find an easy 
solution.  In 4.61 under debian linux with a system character 
set of  UTF-8.  Many messages are received fine, but I get 
a lot that are windows-1252, iso-8859-1, etc. 

The side effects I'm experiencing are that some messages 
converted internally by pine lose things like apostrophes. 
If I have pass-control-characters-as-is and the c1 checked, 
then they render like ~R etc.  Also when I forward a message 
in another character set some users then have problems.

Suggestions?

-James

Dear Friend,

This business proposal to you is strictly Confidential, with due 
respect.
Sorry at this perceived confusion or stress you may have by receiving  
this letter from me, Since we have not known ourselves or  met previously.  
Despite that, I am constrained to write you this letter because of the urgency 
involved.

I am Mrs. Rose Khobe, the wife of late Gen.Maxwell Khobe former ECOMOG 
[West African Peace-Keeping Force] Commander who died in the Sierra Leone  
civil Disturbances[War]. My three Children and I are trapped in obnoxious 
custom traditional rites. We have Suffered maltreatment and untold hardship in
the Hands of my late husbands family, simply because I did not Bear a  male
child  for my late husband by tradition, All that my husband  had,[wealth]
belongs  to his Brothers/family, while myself has to be married by his 
Immediate younger brother.

They have taken all that I suffered with my husband to acquire  
including Treasure, Houses whereby, his bank accounts were closed by his family  
members. I wanted to escape to the United State of America [USA} with my children 
on exile, but again they conspired and stole my international passport 
and other traveling documents to further frustrate me. Thank God, two weeks
ago, I received Key Text Code [KTC} from SECURITIES COMPANY, that my  
husband deposited U.S  $15 Million [Fifteen Million United States Dollars]  cash with this company. It has therefore, become very  necessary and urgent to contact someone, from a foreign country like you to help me receive/secure these funds overseas also to help and invest it on our behalf as well, while we find a way of  getting out to meet 
with you in your country. These funds are kept on a CODE with the Securities Company to avoid detection, seizure or a diversion I have had several telephone discussions
with the Assistant Director of the Securities company who has express willingness
to help me on meeting the companys demand.

This is why I have contacted you to help save my children and, receive 
these funds on our behalf. But, you would need to give me sufficient  
assurance that if you help me out, you would not divert the funds. My children 
and I have resolved to give you 20% of the total sum. This is all my children and I have got to live on. Please, I have reposed my confidence in you and hope you will not disappoint me.

I will forward to you the contact particulars of the assistant director
so that you can contact him and ask the possibility of receiving this  
fund on our behalf as the sole beneficiary, I look forward to your response.

Best Regards,

Mrs. Rose Khobe.

NB: Please response to this email address :- rosekhobe@netscape.net

Blaming this on Windows isn't correct.

I'm basically positive he's referring to "smart quotes" aka "curly quotes"
which aren't in the regular ASCII set.. They turn into Rs and Ss, for example.

I hate 'em too, but they're becoming more prevalent.

Blaming this on Windows is entirely correct- instead of making those be
high-byte or Unicode characters, MS co-opted plain-vanilla control
characters (you're actually seeing "Ctrl-R" and "Ctrl-T" (or the like))
for their "smart" apostrophes.

Then you're talking about something completely different.

Smart quotes I'm talking about (and typed with option keys on Macs for example)
have the high bit set, and when *stripping* the high bit, you end up seeing
Rs and Ss..  and I think these smart quotes were on the Mac before Windows,
that was kind of my implication about "blame".

Whatever fault-laying exercises might be undertaken, yes, I think they 
are probably windows smart quotes from windows code pages in this
instance.  

I'd just like to be able to read the email with all the characters the 
user sent.  But because I read from all sorts of different ssh
connections, pine is great for me and I don't want to switch.  (Hrmmm 
does mutt have this problem?)  So, rather than laying blame, is there 
a way for me to stop this?  I usually read from a debian linux machine 
that is my desktop machine, so I can install extra locales if that helps 
(but doesn't seem to have), or anything else needed.

Or is it a problem that can't be solved?

-James

I am the Director in charge of Overseas investments in The Petroleum Oil and Gas Corporation of South Africa (PetroSA).We have been trying to pay the heirs of one A. ADAMS, a citizen of the United States of America who has huge shares in our company for over Sixty years.This investment has been on since the apartheid regime. During the last
management meetings of our Corporation we realized  that the monetary shares equivalent of the presumed deceased person is up to ($40,000,000.00) Million USD.
All attempts to locate the heirs of the above named person is abortive since he didn't state any next of kin in his shares' certificate. If you can stand as the heir, we have all the paperwork in place to tranfer all the money to your designated account; but you shall only be entitled to 30% of the total amount, we keep 60% and 10% will be used towards offsetting any cost. If you are interested, send us an email to enable us work out modalities to make this transfer possible.

 to the file   /etc/inetd.conf 
 
4)modified the /etc/services entry as 
   imaps     993/tcp 
 
5)Restarted inetd

My university is upgrading from pine 4.33 to 4.60. i have two
questions:

1) Will they need to push a new .pinrc to each user because of the new
available options, or can they just update the symbolic link to
'pine'.

2) Should I try to get them to go to 4.61 for any reason, like broken
functionality in 4.60?

thanks

Kevin,

There is no need to update the .pinerc file, it updates on its own.

:) 2) Should I try to get them to go to 4.61 for any reason, like broken 
:)    functionality in 4.60?

Yes, there are some bugs in 4.60 which make Pine crash, which were fixed 
in 4.61, so it's better to use this new version than the old one. You can 
read the release notes in

http://www.washington.edu/pine/changes.html

click on the changes from 4.60 to 4.61 to get you an idea of what issues 
were found in 4.60.

Subject: IMAP on HP/UX

Mark, I've monkeyed around enough that I _finally_ managed to get the Pine
4.61 suite to build under HP/UX 11.22.  The only problem I'm seeing now is
with IMAP.  It built fine but I can't seem to connect to it from IE.  When
I telnet to port 143 on my Tru64 UNIX box (and IMAP works to this box) I
get this:

* OK [CAPABILITY IMAP4REV1 LOGIN-REFERRALS AUTH=LOGIN] falcon.dickinson.edu IMAP
4rev1 2003.339 at Tue, 27 Jul 2004 08:49:03 -0400 (EDT)

However, on my HP/UX box I get this:

* OK [CAPABILITY IMAP4REV1 LITERAL+ SASL-IR LOGIN-REFERRALS AUTH=LOGIN] falcon2
IMAP4rev1 2004.352 at Tue, 27 Jul 2004 08:49:52 -0400 (EDT)

I think the whole problem is that reference to SASL.  I did a build with
"NOSSL" specified.  Is there something else I need to do to keep SASL out
of the picture?

There is this handy save rule that says Pine should try to find the "nick"
in the addressbook for the sender/from of the message.

It would be very nice if one for one person could list alternate address
(non-primary) that this rule would match against.

Never mind.  The issues was a DNS resolution problem on the PC side.
IMAP's working fine.

Hi,

I would like to be able to change what role I'm using 
to send a message at the editing screen (i.e. to/from/subject, 
etc.) without needing to manually edit the To/From fields.

I know in most cases you can choose what role you want to 
compose with when starting a message from scratch, but 
I don't seem to be offered this option of changing roles 
when replying to a message.  Nor, when is often the case, 
I use the 'mailing list management' option on the bottom 
of messages to post to a mailing list (as I am at the moment 
with this very list) since I never remember what address 
to post to. :-)  I read a lot of mailing lists that will only 
let me post from the address I subscribed from - sometimes an 
entirely unique address for that mailing list alone - and to 
change thing manually for each reply is tedious.  Does that 
make sense?  Any reason why this can't be done? Have I missed 
something?

-James

James,

  There is a feature in Pine4.61 which would help you do this. It is 
called "alternate-role-menu", which when enabled allows you to choose a 
role when you reply to a message. It works as follows: If you enable it, 
you can press "#" to choose a role, but you have the option to choose 
either to forward, compose or reply to the current message using the 
selected role.

:)  Nor, when is often the case, I use the 'mailing list management' 
:) option on the bottom of messages to post to a mailing list (as I am at 
:) the moment with this very list) since I never remember what address to 
:) post to.

This requires that you be able to choose a role when you compose a message 
by following a mailto: link. You can do that only if you apply a patch

redefine what to do with a mailto: link using a scheme. This has to do

I agree that this would be a nice feature..  however, I sub under many 
addresses to different lists.. and in my role definitions, I include body 
searches for those addresses..  so when I reply, it automatically selects that 
role.

It is tedius if you are configuring many roles.. but at the same time, if you 
are going through the hassle of setting up the roles.. might as well add the 
search information in there.

I use something like.. I have a couple of lists that dont seem to get caught 
quite right, so i put something unique from their headers in there to also 
snag on those:

AllText pattern   = email@domain.com
                     [Broken-List]
                     [Someother-List]

Also.. you can configure pine to ask if you want to use a certain role when 
you hit reply.

I've tried that  and never had much success, must be something I'm doing 
wrong - I'll try the AllText patten

I should have been clearer.  I know about alternate-role-menu and use 
that when I compose.  However, when replying to a message from a mailing 
list, where there are usually multiple recipients, pine asks "Reply to 
all recipients?" and when I say yes, takes me straight into editing 
the message without a chance to say what role to use. (This message 
is an example, sent to you and to the list, where althought
alternate-role-menu is on, I wasn't given a chance anywhere to hit '#')
And yes, I know what I should be doing is hitting '#' and then selecting
reply, and then the role, but I so very often select 'r' instead of '#' 
since I'm *thinking* 'reply'.  If I was able to change role easily in 
the editing screen, it wouldn't matter.  Just like if I selected
'#'->reply->role->edit and then wanted to change the role because I'd 
changed my mind ;-)

Ok, if I understand that, (but don't want to mess about with
patches...).

James,

  You were clear from the start. I understood your problem. I was 
suggesting a work around. What you want is not really possible, you've 
already chosen a role (or none) when you are in the composer, and that can 
not be changed (it's like saying "I don't want to get wet" when you are 
already inside the pool). I think there are good reasons so that this can 
not be done at that stage. For example it's not possible to change your 
signature, and less do it if you use an alternate editor, etc.

  If you were willing to choose a role when you press "R" to reply to the 
message, I would suggest you a patch, but that does not seem to be what 
you want to do either, so I guess the answer is that it is not possible to 
do what you want.

I also would like to be able to change the role while in the
midst of composing. FYI, Mulbery, the other decent IMAP client,
can do this.

Yes, try setting this in your feature list:

  [X]  alternate-compose-menu

And then you'll get something like this when you type 'R' to
Reply:

  Use role "nm-public" for Reply?
   ? Help    Y [Yes]                     ^T To Select Alternate Role
  ^C Cancel  N No, use default settings


And you can type ^T to choose a role. There are some other
features that can be used to change the way the Reply prompts
work so you might need to experiment with a bunch of features
until you get a config you're happy with.

HTH,

Another feature that you might want to use is this:

  [ ]  confirm-role-even-for-default

I have this unset, but you might like it. I have some Tips for 
Role Playing here:

  <http://www.ii.com/internet/messaging/pine/changing_from/#roleTips>

which might give you more ideas for how to get a config you're 
happy with. I need to update that section so it discusses the 
4.61 features, e.g., using a role to bounce forward (B) a 
message.

Thanks to Nancy and Eduardo for their suggestions.  

I guess the reason it bothers me not to be able to change 
role once in composing and editing, is that when I 
go to send Pine prompts me with:
Send Message (as James.Cummings@ota.ahds.ac.uk)?  

Really, I guess it is at this point that an alarm bell 
goes off in my head and I say "No, I don't want to send 
it as that address....but oh, how can I change it now?"

Patching is probably the answer, Eduardo is right, I'm 
just too lazy to remember to repatch stuff when I upgrade, etc.

:) Yes, try setting this in your feature list:

:) And then you'll get something like this when you type 'R' to Reply:

This is not correct, this menu does not appear because of the feature 
alternate-compose-menu, this menu appears because the role is used with 
confirmation. The alternate-compose-menu setting has to do with what 
happens after you press "C" to compose, not after pressing "R", "F" or 
"#". I like it a lot.

I have information on this in my web page

http://www.math.washington.edu/~chappa/pine/pine-info/roles/#compose

Maybe one way in which James can get the prompt you suggest is if he edits 
all his roles to be used with confirmation for reply use, plus add a role 
at the end that matches everything that is still used with confirmation. 
It would be an ugly work around but it would work.

	I need this feature too! My case: I have different SMTP servers
for different roles. So, If I make a mistake in SMTP server name or
parameters in role, message will never be sent, because I can't change
role after I compose a message!

I don't use any of this role stuff, but from an outside perspective, being
able to change this on the fly seems useful.  Now, the steps necessary
in a theoretical implementation _might_ be almost as tedious as just
starting over.

But the main reason was the following..

I must be misunderstanding this..

###-- 
###top-posting: It's just a bad idea.

That's my signature (I added the ###s) in the message, and I can edit it
just fine.  I am using an alternate editor.  Now, if you mean you
can't change your signature permanently while editing the current

Thanks for the correction Eduardo. I have all my roles set up to 
to be used "With confirmation" on Reply, Forward, or Compose and 
it's been so long since I set them up that I forgot about that 
aspect of my config. This is another thing that I need to add to 
my "Tips for Role Playing."

Thanks,

How does pine sort subjects? It looks to me like it ignores "Re:" and
"[blah]" at the front of subjects. What other rules are there? Is there
any way to sort so that it doesn't ignore these?

Thanks,
David

Pine also ignores "(fwd)" and some ENGLISH variations of that string too, 
that's part of the algorithm used for sorting, and there's nothing you can 
do about it, unless you manually edit that header.

Do you mean you want it to not ignore "Re:" or some other possibly unknown
to you subject prefixes?

Basically, I don't want to limit someone's configurability (I think 
lots of settings/preferences are GOOD, though I do agree that very often they
can/should be separated into simple/advanced settings)...  but if it IS 
Re: you want to ignore, I am kind of curious why.

Though I guess with real thread sorting nowadays you wouldn't sort by
thread to sort of approximate threading.

I tag viruses and spam using [SPAM] and [VIRUS]. I'd like to deal with all
the spam first, then all the viruses. I think I can just use {SPAM} and
{VIRUS} instead and pine will sort them like I want--I'll test it out.

The real irritation of this feature comes when trying to sort mail from 
mailing lists which use [list] or [list:nnnn] at the beginning of the 
subject header.  You can't sort the items in order of the nnnn number 
because the stuff in brackets is ignored.  I know, normally date or 
arrival order should take care of this, but sometimes it doesn't.

Sorting square bracketed text in the Subject is not just a pine 
issue, but a genereal IMAP issue. I discuss this on my Reverse 
Spam Filtering page in this section:

  <http://www.ii.com/internet/messaging/spam/#implementationMine>


--- begin excerpt ---
One of the keys to my deflexion strategy is to have the spam 
score (_HITS_) inserted into the beginning of the Subject header. 
This makes it easy to order messages by score because I can 
simply do a sort-by-subject in my mail client. I recommend that 
you surround the Subject tag with braces (squiggly brackets) 
because 1) these tagged Subjects will then sort below almost all 
other Subjects when the Subjects are sorted using an ASCII sort 
(because { is charcter 123 out of 127); and 2) a popular 
alternative, square brackets, will not work in an IMAP sort 
because the IMAP sort and thread specification says to ignore 
text that is in square brackets during a sort. If you want to 
muck around with the format of the _HITS_ token, see Keith C. 
Ivey's message Re: adding SPAM hits score to headers in the SA 
mailing list.
--- end excerpt ---


The web page version of the above contains lots of links to 
relevant information. Another issue to be aware of is that Pine 
can display IMAP keywords in the MESSAGE INDEX screen and it 
surrounds those with squiggly brackets and prepends them to the 
Subject field. So you might want to use something other than 
squiggly brackets to distinguish your tags from IMAP keywords.
(Or you could just use IMAP keywords for all this!)

For now, I'm putting the spam score in the Cc: header and have 
set up my Pine index-format so it includes 'CC'. I just posted 
about this yesterday in the SpamAssassin list here:

<http://article.gmane.org/gmane.mail.spam.spamassassin.general/54089>

It's all quite bogus -- I hope there are standards for Spam and 
Virus headers soon!

For what it's worth, you can use patterns to set the scores of the email
in pine, then sort by score. Unfortunately, it's tedious without pattern
matching. Here's a bit from my .pinerc:

patterns-scores2=LIT:pattern="/NICK=Spam 10/ARBX-Spam-Status=hits=1.,hits=2.,hit
s=3.,hits=4.,hits=5.,hits=6.,hits=7.,hits=8.,hits=9./FLDTYPE=EMAIL" action="/ISS

         LIT:pattern="/NICK=Spam 20/ARBX-Spam-Status=hits=10.,hits=11.,hits=12.,h

Nancy:  Sorting square bracketed text in the Subject is not just a pine issue,

Nancy:  page in this section:

Sure it would be great to replace the square brackets with braces, but
ListServ does not do that (I assume this since I do not admin a ListServ
server).

It would be nice to have an option in Pine, multiple checkbox perhaps, to
consider [] in the beginning of the subject line.

It would help when sorting by Subject if a person is subscribed to
multiple ListServ lists, such as myself.



Thanks

This would imply that messages with score 100 would be (in this sort) 
before those whose score is 40 which are before than those whose score is 
7. Is this something that you ignore intentionally? (this is true even if 
you surround all scores with the same tag, like "{" and "}"). Do you 
ignore this because messages with these scores have to be spam?. 

If you want to have the sort by subject respect the sort by score then you 
need to add more stuff there.  The trick consists in making *all* scores 
have the same number of digits, so for example, if SA does not give scores 
bigger than 1000, then add 1000 to the score that SA gives you, so for 
example, a score of 7 in SA would be transformed to 1007, 100 would be 
transformed to 1100, and so on. Now all scores would be sorted correctly, 
and your trick of adding "{" to it would be more useful.

Yes, I /dev/null everything with a SpamAssassin score of 10 or 
more (so the ASCII sort works). If anyone is interested, I talk 
about this on my Procmail Quick Start in these sections:

  <http://www.ii.com/internet/robots/procmail/qs/#SA>
  <http://www.ii.com/internet/robots/procmail/qs/#delete>

And I talk about how to get the score in the Subject header here:

  <http://www.ii.com/internet/messaging/spam/#implementationMine>

And I talk about what I'm doing now, which is a complete hack, 
here:

<http://article.gmane.org/gmane.mail.spam.spamassassin.general/54153>

Feedback is welcome!

I like the idea that pine removes information enclosed between "[" and "]" 
before it sorts by subject since otherwise messages in the same thread 
could be miles away in the folder and for me it is more important to have 
messages in the same thread nearby when I sort by subject.

If what you are looking for is a way to group messages from the same 
mailing list (which you then can sort by subject), then you can do it in 
another way. Simply use the select command.

For example, to select messages from this mailing list I would use the 
command:

; T A "Sender: PINE-INFO"

You could also try to search for some other header, if the Sender header 
is not what identifies your mailing list.

You can not select messages by the content of an arbitrary header unless 
you patch Pine, you have to use the "All Text" option, but it should be 
fast in most storage systems.

Since I wrote this, I realized that the select command will not ignore the

and easier way to do this is simply

; T S "[List Tag]"

Once you have selected them, you can sort them in any way you want.

Here's what I do:

(M)ain (S)etup (C)onfig, display-filters

And add a filter for each charset you want. For iso-8859-1, I have:

    _CHARSET(iso-8859-1)_ /usr/bin/iconv -f iso-8859-1 -t utf-8

That says that when a message is in that charset, iconv will be invoked
to convert it to utf-8 (which is what my terminal is configured for).

You will probably want one for windows-1252 and others. Check iconv's
documentation to see if it supports that charset, and make sure that the
target charset is what your terminal is set to.

	But you will have troubles with such config. If you postpone
converted message, it will have original charset name in headers, but
characters in new charset. So, it will be converted twice, if you
continue editing it. (If you postpone it again, it will be converted
once more, and so on.)
	The only way (at least for me) to read such mail is to use
Bernhard Kaindl patch available from http://www.suse.de/~bk/pine/ .
There were many talkings on it in this list, you can look in archivs.

		Bye. Alex.
