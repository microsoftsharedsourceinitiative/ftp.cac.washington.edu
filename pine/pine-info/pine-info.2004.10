He ate his daily tablet, and after watching the red glow fade in the
western sky and the gray shadows of night settle around him he stretched
himself comfortably upon the grass and went to sleep. The events of the day

He stood up, rubbed the sleep from his eyes and decided he would like a
drink of water

thought it best to move away from them, since he was unable to rise to a

            {THIRTY SIX MILLION USD)
(RE: TRANSFER OF ($ 36,000,000.USD
{BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY/YOUR ASSISTANCE IS NEEDED}

My name is Mr.Mike Duck, and I work in the
International operation department in a Local Bank
here in South Africa. On a routine inspection I
discovered a dormant domiciliary account with a BAL.
Of 36,000,000 (Thirty Six Million USD) on further
discreet investigation, I also discovered that the
account holder has long since passed away (dead)
leaving no beneficiary to the account.

The bank will approve this money to any foreigner
because the former operator of the a/c is a foreigner
and from Iraq in particular and I am certainly sure
that he is dead, and nobody will come again for the
claim of this money A foreigner can only claim this
money with legal claims to the account Holder;
therefore I need your cooperation in this transaction.

I will provide the necessary information needed in
order to claim this money, But you will need to open
an account where this can be transferred.=20

If interested send your private Telephone No. And Fax
number including full details of the account to be
used for the Deposit I wish for utmost confidentiality
in handling this transaction as my job and the future
of my family would be jeopardized if it were breached.

The informations will be as follows.......

Bank Name.........
Bank Address........
A/C  Name.............
A/C  Number..............
Swift Code No..............
Routing Number................

E-mail Me Back Now in this {mikeduck20042003@yahoo.co.nz }

I want to assure you that the transaction is without
risk if due process is followed accordingly. Finally I
will give you 25% for your corporation.

I look forward to a favorable response from you.

Thank's for your maxinium co-operation and remain
blessed.

Best Regards,

Mr.Mike Duck

Subject: incoming folders vs tab completion of regular acct

I had turned on 'enable incoming folders' to see if there was an easier way
I could access my mac.com address.  I don't really *use* that account, 
but mostly to clean out stuff or read stuff once in a while would be
convenient.

What I noticed was that I could no longer tab-complete other folders (e.g.
sent-mail) because I guess it no longer had the concept of a "main account"
anymore.

Looking at the Incoming Folders list, I see that I can add folders there.
I guess I could technically replicate my whole folder hierarchy there (but
that would be a pain).

So I turned off the incoming folders feature and reran pine.  I still
have my collection set up for my mac.com account, but it doesn't have
my INBOX in that list.  Can I somehow make it so I can use my mac.com
address just through that collection (and see my INBOX there of course)
without Incoming folders?  It only shows a test folder I made long ago and
a sent items folder.

These issues aren't a big deal, I just wondered how I could get it all to
work best.

This is with pine 4.61.

This doesn't work unless the attachment is marked as a text file
(e.g., has extension ".txt").  Else, windows doesn't know either how
to open that file.  The easiest remedy would be to force pine to
display the attachment if the attachment is known (to the user) to be
a text file.

Dear Sir,

Re: PAYMENT SOLUTION

I am professor Chukwuemeka Charles Soludo, the newly appointed Governor of 
Central Bank of

Nigeria, CBN. My office monitors and controls the affairs of all other banks 
and financial

institutions in Nigeria. I am the final signatory to any transfer or 
remittance of huge funds

moving from bank to bank both local and international levels.

Now, I have before me funds which could not be transfered to some nominated 
accounts by some

individuals due to the fact that these bank accounts where ghost accounts, 
unclaimed deposits and

over-invoiced sum etc. As it is my duty to recommend the transfer of these 
supplus funds to the

Federal government treasury and reserve accounts as unclaim deposits, I have 
the opportunity to

write you.

I have in my computer list of Names of Contractors who have not received 
their payments due to

fraudulant activities by some officials of the bank  representatives who 
parade fake documents.
(as reported to me via strong evidences).

In view of the above, I write to have a deal with you as regards to your 
unpaid contract sum.
Your file is right here on my table.

Having received instructions 2 days ago from the Senate Committee on 
Contract Payments / Foreign

Debts to submit the end of the month reports of payments/expenditures and 
audited reports of

revenues. Hence this letter to you.

Among several others, I have decided to remit your contract sum in two parts 
following my idea

that we have a deal/agreement.

-1) That you will remit to my own account [which I will provide if you agree 
with this deal] the

sum of USD$5M, only if after you have confirmed the transfer of first half 
of your contract sum

into your
account by telegraphic Transfer (T/T), confirmable in 3 working days.

As soon as I receive my share (US$5M) in my accounts, I will remit your 2nd 
half to your contract

sum into your local account .

-2) This deal must be kept secret forver, and All correspondece is  strictly 
by email /

telephone, for security purposes.

-3) That you will assist me legally before the Senate Committee and the 
Court if the need arises.

If you AGREE with my DEAL, I will tell you what to do immediately and I will 
instruct the

transfer to

your account within 3 days of my action. I will proceed to fix your name on 
the Payment schedule

instantly facilitate the endorsement by the Seante exactly 3 days.

Waiting for your reply soon via my office email 
above(charles_soludo555@yahoo.com)

Congratulations!

PROFESSOR CHARLES CHUKWUEMEKA

SOLUDO


GOVERNOR, CBN

                    HIGHLY PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL 

ATTN:MANAGER/DIRECTOR/C.E.O 

DEAR,SIR/MADAM 

You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally. I RUN MOYO, the first son of USMAN MOYO who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I got your contact through network online hence decided to write you. 
Before the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US$20Million (Twenty Million United States Dollars), in one of the private security companies, as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This money was deposited in a box as germ stones to 
avoid much demurrage from the Security Company. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and establishment of a new farm in Swaziland. 
This land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe introduced a new Land Act reform which wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few black farmers.This resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In fact, a lot of people were killed because of this land reformed Act for which my father was one of the victims. 
It is against this background that, I and my family who are currently staying in South Africa decided to transfer my fathers money to a foreign country since the law of South Africa prohibits refugees open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction througout the teritorial zones of South Africa. As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred into without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything . All i seek for is an honest businessman, whom I can entrust my future and that of my family , I must also let you know that this transaction is 100%risk free. If you accept to assist me and my family all I want from you is for you to make arrangements and come to Johannesburg  South Africa, so that you can help me open a non-resident account in your name which will aid us in transferring the money into any account you will nominate overseas.!
  This
 money I intend to use for investmentand growth in your country. 
I have two options for you, firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction, Or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country. Whichever the option you want, feel free to notify me. I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses we might incure in the process of this transaction. If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 25% of the money while the remaining 70% will remain for me and my family.If you are realy capable and willing to assist me please contact me immediately with the above TeL or this e-mail address with which i have sent you this message.Finally, please treat this matter as urgent as possible, i'm in dire need to leave this country soonest.Thanks for your mutual co-operation, 
I expect your soonest response. 
Kind Regards, 
MR.RUN MOYO. 
(For the Family)

OTC Pink Sheets:  TIRR  today  announced  the  acquisition of a 100=
%
working interest in a 4 well oil field in Karnes County, Texas.  The
South  Texas  field, which has been shut in since the mid 1990s when
the price  of  oil  declined  to  less  than  $10.00  per barrel, is
situated on 260 acres. Tradestar will initially focus its efforts in
the Nobson  Field,  which  has  reserves  of  approximately  100,000
barrels.  The  company  also  has  options on adjoining acreage with
additional prospects. The  recompletion  project,  anticipated to be
completed and online by mid- November, is expected  to  yield  25-30
barrels of oil per day.


Oct  6,  2004  Tradestar  Corporation  (OTC Pink Sheets: TIRR) today
announced the acquisition of a  producing gas well and disposal well
in Erath  County,  Texas.  The  single  well  package  is  currently
producing  50 thousand cubic feet of natural gas per day and has one
offset drill location  that  could  push  daily production to better
than 200 thousand cubic  feet  per  day.  An  additional  300  acres
surrounding the wells are under option as well. The acquisition also
offers  Barnett  Shale  potential,  which Tradestar CEO Tom Feimster
called "strategic" in light  of  the company's current joint venture
with United Production and Exploration.

With oil and natural gas prices sitting near  10-year  highs,  North
American  oil  &  gas  companies are generating exceptionally strong
financial  results.   With  increased  consumption  and  reliance on
foreign imports driving the price of crude to nearly $50 per barrel,
the resulting US energy situation is the most serous domestic energy
crisis since the Arab oil embargo of the 1970=92s.  With more than 57=
%
of US oil coming from foreign  imports,  US  crude  inventories  are
likely  to  remain  at  low  levels  given  anemic  production  from
Venezuela  and Nigeria, continuing uncertainty over Iraqi wells, and
production  caps  from  OPEC.   On  the  natural  gas  front, supply
continues to remain  tight  to  increasing  demand,  with  shrinking
relative  US  production.   These  international  supply  issues are
increasingly driving a  renewed  trend  towards domestic exploration
and  production  operations,  New  developments  in  the   petroleum
industry  are  beginning  to  play  out in terms of discovery of new
reserves and more  efficient  production  of existing reserves, with
the increased use of technologies such as  3-D  seismic  making  new
exploration more affordable and effective, and with use of secondary
and  tertiary recovery processes to recover the more than 60% of oil
left in-ground with primary production techniques.

Tradestar Corporation is a rapidly  emerging independent oil and gas
company, engaged in the exploration, development,  and  exploitation
of  on-shore  oil  and natural gas opportunities in proven producing
areas  of  the  United   States,   including  Oklahoma,  Texas,  and
Louisiana.   The  Company  intends  to  utilize  advanced   oilfield
surveying  and extraction technologies, such as 3-D seismic, lateral
drilling, and  enhanced  oil  recovery,  to  identify,  acquire, and
exploit bypassed  and  overlooked  reserves  which  can  be  rapidly
exploited  without  significant  risk  and capital expenditure.  The
Company is capitalizing on both of  the major trends in domestic oil
and gas E&P operations, carefully screening and selecting properties
for  maximum  potential  of  overlooked  and   bypassed   production
opportunities,   and   using  advanced  production  technologies  to
minimize risks.  Under the guidance of a management team experienced
in oil and gas  exploration  and production, Tradestar has developed
critical strategic relationships with oil industry partners  and  is
beginning  an aggressive acquisition strategy, targeting a number of
highly promising opportunities throughout the United States.  With a
number of major  projects  in  the  acquisition pipeline, we believe
that TIRR presents a unique chance  to  invest   in   the   domestic
oil  &  gas  boom.  Aggressive  investors  looking for above-average
return potential on  a  portion  of  their investment capital should
give TIRR serious consideration.  Management of the Company,  headed
by  CEO Tom Feimster, are highly talented and experienced in the oil
& gas industry,  and  posses  a  wealth  of  technical expertise and
knowledge.  We believe that TIRR has developed a viable  and  highly
promising  acquisition strategy, backed by its commitment to the use
of  new  oilfield  technologies   and  focus  on  exploiting  proven
producing properties, which should enable  the  Company  to  rapidly
develop  significant  revenue streams.  Investors at current trading
levels may be rewarded  over  the  short  term  and beyond as TIRR=92s
business plan is executed.  TIRR is one of the  market=92s  best  kept
secrets,  and  we  expect  investors  to  give this issue increasing
attention over the coming months.


A  Few Reasons to Consider Adding TIRR to Your Investment Portfolio.

The  outlook  for oil & gas stocks is extremely positive with prices
at  historic  levels  and  continued  demand  stimulating additional
exploration and production efforts among domestic producers.   While
it  seems  unlikely that prices will remain at their current levels,
the  long  term  outlook  for  both  demand  and  higher  prices  is
unparalleled in  recent  history.   With  current market conditions,
domestic E&P companies are experiencing a huge run-up in  prices  as
they seek to exploit North America=92s significant oil and natural gas
resource   base   with   new  exploration  techniques  and  drilling
technologies.  Through its dual  positioning  in high-growth oil and
natural gas markets, we believe  that  TIRR  is  exceptionally  well
situated  to  benefit  from  these  favorable  market conditions and
stands to see significant appreciation  of  its share price over the
near term period.

With its operations in the exploration  and  production  of  natural
gas  properties, TIRR is ideally positioned at the forefront of a US
natural   gas   boom.     As    US   demand   for   natural  gas  is
increasing, domestic  production  is  becoming  strained  with  many
long-term prime producing areas reaching the point of depletion.  By
2020,  US  consumption  of  natural  gas, driven by the expansion of
gas-fired electric generation  facilities,  is  expected to reach 37
trillion cubic feet from approximately 23  Tcf  currently.   Natural
gas  prices  on the spot market have nearly doubled from less than 2
years ago, and  are  currently  testing  the  $6 per million British
thermal units (Btu) price threshold, with increases to  $8-9  levels
likely  over the winter months.  With US demand exceeding production
of roughly 18-19 Tcf per  year,  approximately 14% of US natural gas
needs are already being imported  from  Canada.   With  natural  gas
impossible  to  transport  across oceans (with the exception of LNG,
which  represents  a   small   fraction   of   overall  natural  gas
consumption), this  has  created  a  tremendous  future for domestic
E&P firms, including TIRR.

Tradestar is in the process of acquiring  a  balanced  portfolio  of
producing  oil  &  gas  properties  onshore  in  the  Gulf coast and
Oklahoma, which will significantly  improve its asset base, revenue,
and earnings outlook over the near term period.   TIRR  has  entered
into  a  letter  of  intent to acquire two properties in the heavily
producing Arkoma Basin region of  Oklahoma, one of the most prolific
natural gas producing areas in North America with estimated reserves
of 30 Tcf.  The Company has  also  proposed  a  JV  project  in  the
dynamic Barnett Shale natural gas play in Central Texas, the largest
producing gas field in Texas with estimated reserves of more than 10
Tcf.   TIRR  has additionally acquired a 260 acre property in Karnes
County,  Texas  a  mature  producing  area  which  can  provide  new
opportunities  due  to  improvements   in  drilling  technology  and
production  techniques.   With  these  properties,  and   additional
planned  acquisitions  in  the onshore Gulf Coast region, we believe
that Tradestar is admirably positioned as a Strong junior oil &  gas
investment.

TIRR has developed an innovative business model centered on  pursuit
of  a  balanced  development and exploration strategy and portfolio,
and the use of  advanced  oilfield survey and recovery technologies,
which will significantly  improve  production  efforts  at  acquired
properties.   Tradestar  seeks  to  acquire  bypassed and overlooked
reserves in proven producing areas, and to develop working interests
in undercapitalized and  under-producing  projects.  TIRR intends to
capitalize  and  maximize  on   already   developed   drilling   and
exploration  projects  with  lower cost initiatives that have a high
degree of success including  infield  drilling (drilling of multiple
wells  onto  an  existing  leasehold),  development  of  behind-pipe
reserves (development of shallower =93pay=94  zones  above  the  deepest
productive  zone  on  established wells), secondary and EOR recovery
techniques,  lateral  drilling,  and   the  use  of  other  advanced
completion and production techniques.   Tradestar  also  intends  to
aggressively   pursue  acquisition  opportunities  for  higher-risk,
higher reward E&P  prospects,  utilizing  advanced  data analysis to
reprocess older 2-D seismic data with 3-D  seismic  and  correlating
this  seismic,  gravity, geochemical and geologic data with existing
well  logs  to   significantly   mitigate   the   expense  and  risk
traditionally associated with new E&P projects.

FROM THE DESK OF: Dr. JACOB NELSON.

DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORT

 

 

ATTN: Sir,

 

I write to solicit for your assistance in a matter
that can be of mutual benefit to us. I only pray that
you read through carefully and respond as promptly as
possible. Precisely, in the year 2000, the Ministry of
Transport, South Africa where I work as a Director of
auditing and project Implementation, received
presidential irrevocable circular order requesting the
ministry to compile and forward the list of all past
foreign contractors, whose contract payments are
pending since the period of the immediate past regime
of Dr, Nelson Mandela and the present regime. 

 

The purpose of this exercise was for the present South
Africa elected government to pay foreign contractors
all debts owed, so as to maintain good relationship
with other foreign governments and non-governmental
financial agencies. In light of the above, my
colleagues and I decided to include a company's name
with a bill of {US$18.5Million} Eighteen million Five
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars} along side
other company's name and their respective bills for
payment impression that {Alliance Mining SA PTY} which
we Incorporated here for this exercise, also carried
out contractual works of supply to the Ministry as
well as others. 

 

With the cooperation of top senior colleagues of mine
we are confident that our claim of {US$18.5Million}
shall be granted being for contract work executed at
the Ministry of transport, we will have to file an
application letter for contact payment to the
Ministry, after which payment shall then be
transferred upon approval to a safe account as would
be provided by you in other words, if you accept to be
our partner then you shall be considered given the
pertinent documentations to certify that you had
bought over this company and the companys privileges
have been transferred to your companys name for which
your company shall be paid the sun of US$18.5Million .

 

Please be informed that with the South African

Looking To Revolutionize the Way Music is Promoted and Sampled
Sounds 24-7, Inc.(OTC:SDSS)
Current Price: $.05

Possibilty of Huge Day Tuesday as a Massive PR Campaign Launches This 3 Da=
y Weekend.

Imagine how well your portfolio would have done the last five weeks if you=
 had the scoop on the following Small Cap Stock:

(OTCBB-LENF)Closed September 1st at $.75. This SmallCap traded over $3.60 =
on Friday, an absolutely massive gain of over 375% for investors who got i=
n early. Face it, Some of these Small Stocks Really Move!!

Let's Look at Today's Featured Company, Sounds 24-7, Inc.(OTC-SDSS)

About The Company: CHANGING THE FACE OF THE MUSIC AND RECORDING INDUSTRY!

Sounds 24-7, Inc., is changing the way music from Major Labels, Independen=
t Labels and Artists are marketed, promoted and distributed to today's pro=
liferation of listening outlets. The numbers seem to be unmanageable:

85,000 traditional, internet, satellite, commercial, non-commercial and co=
llege radio stations, 8.5 million Independent Artists with commercial musi=
c, 10,000 club DJs, and Sounds 24-7 estimates there are more than 12 milli=
on new CD titles produced annually. Today, as in yesterday, music sales co=
ntinue to be driven by the Consumer first hearing the music as a prelude t=
o the purchase of music. The Consumer now supplements his/her Tradional Ra=
dio Listening with tens of thousands of other radio stations. Sounds 24-7 =
offers instant access to all stations, all music with the largest catalog =
of music anywhere that is building to the availability of multi-millions o=
f tracks of songs. Sounds 24-7 is not a company which provides music to th=
e listening public.

Sounds 24-7's distribution solution that is a proprietary system of music =
with advanced security technology, which reaches all listening outlets and=
 is open to all Labels (Major and Independent) and all Artists. The Major =
Labels are offered access to Sounds 24-7's distribution system at no cost,=
 without any changes to the "rules of usage" and only pay, if they so choo=
se, for playtime reporting. Radio stations and club DJs receive Sounds 24-=
7 at no cost. Independent Labels and Artists pay a nominal fee to be inclu=
ded in Sounds 24-7's Library.

In the weeks and months to come, Sounds 24-7 will be building revolutionar=
y and profitable relationships with the labels and artists as Sounds 24-7 =
build what will become the largest library of music available anywhere. At=
 the same time, credentials and passwords will be allotted to radio statio=
ns and club DJ's, but only after they are screened for legitimacy. All the=
se relationships will be carefully cultivated to result in maximum effecti=
veness for all concerned.

Hmm, I just added a new item to my address book and got scary messages
about
Address book changed
Rolling back address book

something like that..

I was able to successfully add it a second time, and going into my
address book, it all looks fine..  So the safeguards worked as designed..

But what could have happened to cause this?  I've never seen it before,
and I am not running multiple pines on the same machine or anything.

I figure since we have page up/page down, we could also make scrolling
mice work, too.

Is this possible?

the long pole is probably getting your terminal emulator to recognize the 
mouse wheel. once that's working, it should hopefully be straightforward 
to configure it to send up/down or pgup/pgdn, which would work with pine 
unmodified.

I know there's support in Pine for mice selection (I think; I don't use it)
in xterms; since I use Pine exclusively in xterms, I'd imagine this is
where the support would be added.

(RE: TRANSFER OF ($ 36,000,000.USD
{BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY/YOUR ASSISTANCE IS NEEDED}

My name is MrChrisfav UgoChukwu., and I work in the
International operation department in a Local Bank
here in South Africa. On a routine inspection I
discovered a dormant domiciliary account with a BAL.
Of 36,000,000 (Thirty Six Million USD) on further
discreet investigation, I also discovered that the
account holder has long since passed away (dead)
leaving no beneficiary to the account.

The bank will approve this money to any foreigner
because the former operator of the a/c is a foreigner
and from Iraq in particular and I am certainly sure
that he is dead, and nobody will come again for the
claim of this money A foreigner can only claim this
money with legal claims to the account Holder;
therefore I need your cooperation in this transaction.

I will provide the necessary information needed in
order to claim this money, But you will need to open
an account where this can be transferred. 

If interested send your private Telephone No. And Fax
number including full details of the account to be
used for the Deposit I wish for utmost confidentiality
in handling this transaction as my job and the future
of my family would be jeopardized if it were breached.

The informations will be as follows.......

Bank Name.........
Bank Address........
A/C  Name.............
A/C  Number..............
Swift Code No..............
Routing Number................

I want to assure you that the transaction is without
risk if due process is followed accordingly. Finally I
will give you 25% for your corporation.

I look forward to a favorable response from you.

Thank's for your maxinium co-operation and remain
blessed.

Best Regards,
Chrisfav UgoChukwu

The Wall Street Investor

An Oil Discovery That Will Put The Middle East Out Of Business.

One of the most exciting oil & gas investment plays  
that  we  have  seen over the past year,
A promising stock investment opportunities

Am-Tex  Oil  &  Gas.

REASON  Production and major news pending

With oil prices over   50  per  barrel,  and foreign imports looking
increasingly  unreliable,  this  is  a  boom  period  for   US   oil
exploration  companies.   Savvy-investors that have been buying AMTX
will reap the rewards very  shortly  due  to EPS and Major discovery
news in our opinion.

Morgan Stanley recently forecast that the price of oil  could  reach
as  high  as  80 per barrel by the end of the year!!  With more than
57%  of  US  oil   coming   from  foreign  imports,  and  increasing
international instability, the  industry  is  undergoing  a  renewed
trend  towards  domestic  exploration and production.  US demand for
natural gas  is  dramatically  increasing  with  overall consumption
expected to grow by more than 60% to 37 trillion cubic feet by 2020,
and natural gas prices on the spot market nearly doubling from  less
than two years ago.

With  this  in mind, we ask you to consider one of the most exciting
oil & gas investment plays  that  we  have  seen over the past year,
Am-Tex  Oil  &  Gas.   While  there  are  any  number  of  promising
investment opportunities in the oil &  gas  small  cap  segment,  we
almost  never  see  stock  opportunities  with the same pedigree and
certainty of AMTX.  Am-Tex  has  recently  entered into an agreement
with oil industry giant, Exxon-Mobil and Holifield Oil Company,  for
joint  production  of  a  928 acre property in the heavily producing
Giddings Field in Lee County, Texas.

With Holifield Oil  Company,  AMTX  has  been  able  to secure a 25=
%
working interest  in  this  project,  while  Exxon-Mobil  holds  the
remaining  75%  interest.   AMTX  recently  announced  that  it  has
commenced  drilling  operations  on  Edgmon-Cameron,  and expects to
begin production  of  commercially  viable  oil  over  the  next 3-4
months, with initial yield expectations of more than 600 barrels per
day.  Over the next several years, AMTX plans  to  bring  additional
wells  online,  and  projects annual income of more than  80 million
when the site has been fully developed by 2008!!!

Through this tremendous alliance  with  visionary oil wildcatter Ray
Holifield  and  Exxon-Mobil,  we  believe  that  Am-Tex  Oil  &  Gas
represents the single most exciting investment opportunity  we  have
seen  in  the  past  two years.  At trading levels of only $0.25 per
share, this is a true  undiscovered gem.  When commercial production
begins over the next several months, this stock  will  explode.   We
urge you to consider investing in Am-Tex Oil & Gas now, and see your
investment explode by 300-500% over the next 3-4 months!!!

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
1.   The  outlook  for  US  oil  and gas stocks has rarely been more
optimistic  in   recent   years,   with   skyrocketing  consumption,
decreasing domestic production,  and  foreign  supply  uncertainties
contributing to historical price levels for oil and natural gas.  In
2004,  the  US  will  consumer  7.5  billion  barrels  of oil, while
domestic oil production is declining  by  2%  annually and is at its
lowest levels since the 1950=92s,  with  more  than  57%  of  domestic
consumption coming from imports.  With crude oil now trading at more
than  $50 per barrel, Morgan Stanley has recently predicted that oil
could reach $80 by the  end  of  the  year!!!   At the same time, US
demand for natural gas is increasing at an  exponential  rate,  with
consumption expected to increase at a rate of 60-65% to more than 37
trillion  cubic  feet  (currently  23  Tcf)  by 2020.  With domestic
production of  roughly  18-19  Tcf  per  year,  this  has  created a
tremendous supply shortage, and  is  likely  to  drive  natural  gas
prices  well  above  current  levels of $5-6 per BTU.  Many analysts
predict that natural gas prices  on  the  spot market could reach as
high as $9 by winter!!!

2.  In partnership with oil industry giant Exxon-Mobil and Holifield
Oil Company, AMTX has acquired a 25% working interest in a 928  acre
property,  located  at the Giddings Field, in the Austin Chalk Trend
of Lee County, Texas.   The  Giddings  Field was first discovered in
the 1930=92s and has been responsible  for  cumulative  production  of
more  than 380 million barrels of oil and 2.1 trillion cubic feet of
natural gas.  Most of this production was undertaken with antiquated
vertical drilling techniques, leaving a  huge  amount of oil and gas
reserves un-recovered in the ground- engineering  estimates  suggest
that  there is over  1 billion in oil and gas reserves waiting to be
recovered in the Giddings Field!!!  Using advanced seismic analysis,
horizontal drilling, and proprietary  recovery technologies, AMTX is
aggressively re-entering the Giddings Field, and  expects  to  begin
substantial  production  from  the  property  over  the next several
months.

3.  Ray Holifield,  responsible  for  AMTX  exploration and drilling
operations, is a legend in the oil & gas industry, who  has  drilled
over  2,000  wells  in  this  same  formation  over the past quarter
century.  His wells in the Giddings  Field have produced more than 3
to 4 times the oil of other wells in the same area,  and  the  total
oil  revenues  from his wells exceeds $5 billion with an ROI of 5:1,
simply unheard of  compared  to  industry  standards  of 2.  What is
more, Ray Holifield has undertaken an extensive geological  analysis
and survey of the area, at a cost of more than  10 million, which he
can  use  to accurately pinpoint and exploit reserves.  When he used
these techniques and surveys in  Lee County, Texas, the results were
astonishing.  Of 647  vertical  wells  drilled,  initial  production
average  more  than  a  thousand  barrels  of oil per day, and total
production averaged 147,900 BOE, results more than 4.5 times greater
than other operators in the same  area!  Simply put, in the Giddings
Field, there is no better man to oversee production,  who  has  more
experience and a proven track record of success, that Ray Holifield.

4.   AMTX  is  ready  to  begin production now in the Giddings Field
property, and expects to generate  initial production of 600 barrels
per day, with oil and  gas  income  of   80  million  projected  for
2008!!!  AMTX has selected 20 sites for new wells or re-entries, and
expects  to  be  producing  600  barrels  a  day within the next few
months- generating income for  the Company of approximately  110,000
in the first quarter of 2005.  AMTX will bring one well online every
quarter in the early stages, and then  plans  to  use  cash-flow  to
start-up  two wells per quarter.  By the first quarter of 2008, AMTX
projects that it will  be  earning  income  of  over $20 million, an
annualized rate of more  than   80  million!!!   Based  on  earnings
projections  of  $80 million for 2008, and applying the industry P/E
of 16x, this suggests a valuation  for  AMTX of  14.00 per share- an
increase of more than 5100% to current trading levels!!!

5.  At its current trading range of around  $0.25  per  share,  AMTX
represents  a  tremendous  opportunity  to  see  huge profits.  With
production slated to begin  over  the  next several months, we think
that the stock will see major share price increases once  the  wells
begin production- with early investors seeing gains of 300-500=
% over
the  next  3-4  months!!   Historically,  oil  and  gas  exploration
companies  see  their  stock price increase upwards of 100-200=
% with
major milestones, such as indicated resources, increased production,
and the successful completion or  start-up of wells.  FCGCF exploded
from  the  low  $1  range  to  nearly  $8  when  it  hit  its  first
commercially viable oil in September of 2002, a gain  of  more  than
700%,  while  OILXF  skyrocketed  428% from $1.00 to $2.64 from July
2003 to January 2004, when they  struck  oil in the North Sea.  With
commercial production from the Giddings Field,  helmed  by  industry
pioneer Ray Holifield, we think that AMTX will dwarf the price gains
of these players, and make early investors rich in the process!!

Morgan Stanley recently forecast that the price of oil  could  reach
as  high  as  80 per barrel by the end of the year!!  With more than
57%  of  US  oil   coming   from  foreign  imports,  and  increasing
international instability, the  industry  is  undergoing  a  renewed
trend  towards  domestic  exploration and production.  US demand for
natural gas  is  dramatically  increasing  with  overall consumption
expected to grow by more than 60% to 37 trillion cubic feet by 2020,
and natural gas prices on the spot market nearly doubling from  less
than two years ago.

With  this  in mind, we ask you to consider one of the most exciting
oil & gas investment plays  that  we  have  seen over the past year,
Am-Tex  Oil  &  Gas.   While  there  are  any  number  of  promising
investment opportunities in the oil &  gas  small  cap  segment,  we
almost  never  see  stock  opportunities  with the same pedigree and
certainty of AMTX.  Am-Tex  has  recently  entered into an agreement
with oil industry giant, Exxon-Mobil and Holifield Oil Company,  for
joint  production  of  a  928 acre property in the heavily producing
Giddings Field in Lee County, Texas.

With Holifield Oil  Company,  AMTX  has  been  able  to secure a 25=
%
working interest  in  this  project,  while  Exxon-Mobil  holds  the
remaining  75%  interest.   AMTX  recently  announced  that  it  has
commenced  drilling  operations  on  Edgmon-Cameron,  and expects to
begin production  of  commercially  viable  oil  over  the  next 3-4
months, with initial yield expectations of more than 600 barrels per
day.  Over the next several years, AMTX plans  to  bring  additional
wells  online,  and  projects annual income of more than  80 million
when the site has been fully developed by 2008!!!

Through this tremendous alliance  with  visionary oil wildcatter Ray
Holifield  and  Exxon-Mobil,  we  believe  that  Am-Tex  Oil  &  Gas
represents the single most exciting investment opportunity  we  have
seen  in  the  past  two years.  At trading levels of only $0.25 per
share, this is a true  undiscovered gem.  When commercial production
begins over the next several months, this stock  will  explode.   We
urge you to consider investing in Am-Tex Oil & Gas now, and see your
investment explode by 300-500% over the next 3-4 months!!!

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
1.   The  outlook  for  US  oil  and gas stocks has rarely been more
optimistic  in   recent   years,   with   skyrocketing  consumption,
decreasing domestic production,  and  foreign  supply  uncertainties
contributing to historical price levels for oil and natural gas.  In
2004,  the  US  will  consumer  7.5  billion  barrels  of oil, while
domestic oil production is declining  by  2%  annually and is at its
lowest levels since the 1950=92s,  with  more  than  57%  of  domestic
consumption coming from imports.  With crude oil now trading at more
than  $50 per barrel, Morgan Stanley has recently predicted that oil
could reach $80 by the  end  of  the  year!!!   At the same time, US
demand for natural gas is increasing at an  exponential  rate,  with
consumption expected to increase at a rate of 60-65% to more than 37
trillion  cubic  feet  (currently  23  Tcf)  by 2020.  With domestic
production of  roughly  18-19  Tcf  per  year,  this  has  created a
tremendous supply shortage, and  is  likely  to  drive  natural  gas
prices  well  above  current  levels of $5-6 per BTU.  Many analysts
predict that natural gas prices  on  the  spot market could reach as
high as $9 by winter!!!

2.  In partnership with oil industry giant Exxon-Mobil and Holifield
Oil Company, AMTX has acquired a 25% working interest in a 928  acre
property,  located  at the Giddings Field, in the Austin Chalk Trend
of Lee County, Texas.   The  Giddings  Field was first discovered in
the 1930=92s and has been responsible  for  cumulative  production  of
more  than 380 million barrels of oil and 2.1 trillion cubic feet of
natural gas.  Most of this production was undertaken with antiquated
vertical drilling techniques, leaving a  huge  amount of oil and gas
reserves un-recovered in the ground- engineering  estimates  suggest
that  there is over  1 billion in oil and gas reserves waiting to be
recovered in the Giddings Field!!!  Using advanced seismic analysis,
horizontal drilling, and proprietary  recovery technologies, AMTX is
aggressively re-entering the Giddings Field, and  expects  to  begin
substantial  production  from  the  property  over  the next several
months.

3.  Ray Holifield,  responsible  for  AMTX  exploration and drilling
operations, is a legend in the oil & gas industry, who  has  drilled
over  2,000  wells  in  this  same  formation  over the past quarter
century.  His wells in the Giddings  Field have produced more than 3
to 4 times the oil of other wells in the same area,  and  the  total
oil  revenues  from his wells exceeds $5 billion with an ROI of 5:1,
simply unheard of  compared  to  industry  standards  of 2.  What is
more, Ray Holifield has undertaken an extensive geological  analysis
and survey of the area, at a cost of more than  10 million, which he
can  use  to accurately pinpoint and exploit reserves.  When he used
these techniques and surveys in  Lee County, Texas, the results were
astonishing.  Of 647  vertical  wells  drilled,  initial  production
average  more  than  a  thousand  barrels  of oil per day, and total
production averaged 147,900 BOE, results more than 4.5 times greater
than other operators in the same  area!  Simply put, in the Giddings
Field, there is no better man to oversee production,  who  has  more
experience and a proven track record of success, that Ray Holifield.

4.   AMTX  is  ready  to  begin production now in the Giddings Field
property, and expects to generate  initial production of 600 barrels
per day, with oil and  gas  income  of   80  million  projected  for
2008!!!  AMTX has selected 20 sites for new wells or re-entries, and
expects  to  be  producing  600  barrels  a  day within the next few
months- generating income for  the Company of approximately  110,000
in the first quarter of 2005.  AMTX will bring one well online every
quarter in the early stages, and then  plans  to  use  cash-flow  to
start-up  two wells per quarter.  By the first quarter of 2008, AMTX
projects that it will  be  earning  income  of  over $20 million, an
annualized rate of more  than   80  million!!!   Based  on  earnings
projections  of  $80 million for 2008, and applying the industry P/E
of 16x, this suggests a valuation  for  AMTX of  14.00 per share- an
increase of more than 5100% to current trading levels!!!

5.  At its current trading range of around  $0.25  per  share,  AMTX
represents  a  tremendous  opportunity  to  see  huge profits.  With
production slated to begin  over  the  next several months, we think
that the stock will see major share price increases once  the  wells
begin production- with early investors seeing gains of 300-500=
% over
the  next  3-4  months!!   Historically,  oil  and  gas  exploration
companies  see  their  stock price increase upwards of 100-200=
% with
major milestones, such as indicated resources, increased production,
and the successful completion or  start-up of wells.  FCGCF exploded
from  the  low  $1  range  to  nearly  $8  when  it  hit  its  first
commercially viable oil in September of 2002, a gain  of  more  than
700%,  while  OILXF  skyrocketed  428% from $1.00 to $2.64 from July
2003 to January 2004, when they  struck  oil in the North Sea.  With
commercial production from the Giddings Field,  helmed  by  industry
pioneer Ray Holifield, we think that AMTX will dwarf the price gains
of these players, and make early investors rich in the process!!

Hi,

I have some weird problems with PC-Pine.
For some reason, not all emails are listed correctly in the inbox.
Some appears without "sender" and without the subject.
Others are correct.
I can't find anything on that matter in the FAQ or anywhere else.

Someone can help ?

Thanks,

Have you looked at the actual headers of the message?  They could be

Actually, I've made multiple tests and depending on where it's coming from,
like "Outlook Express" or "Outlook", when you display the content of the

present initially)

Were those fields populated with data?

Try opening up the INBOX with NotePad (or WordPad).  I suspect those

> The headers are there, just not showing in the INBOX.

There must not be any empty line in the header section. The first empty 
line marks the border between header and body. Sometime I see mail 
messages where there is an empty line sneaked in.


Example 1 -- correct mail:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
To: lisa@example.se
From: nisse@namn.se
Subject: First example

Blah blah blah
Blah blah blah
Blah blah blah
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


Example 2 -- incorrect mail:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
To: lisa@example.se

From: nisse@namn.se
Subject: First example

Blah blah blah
Blah blah blah
Blah blah blah
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


When the second example is presented in pine, there will be no sender and 
no subject.

Watches, clocks and alarm clocks manufactured in Switzerland bear the desi=
gnation -Swiss made- (or its abbreviation "Swiss") as well as the logo of =
the producer or distributor. This label enjoys a solid reputation througho=
ut the world. 

What lies behind this reputation
What does a label like this mean for the consumer

"Swiss made" embodies a concept of quality that has been forged over the y=
ears. It includes the technical quality of watches (accuracy, reliability,=
 water-resistance and shock-resistance), as well as their aesthetic qualit=
y (elegance and originality of design). It covers both traditional manufac=
turing and new technologies (micro-electronics).

The Swiss are not the only watchmakers to manufacture high-quality timepie=
ces and are consequently faced with strong competition. However, thanks to=
 their unique infrastructure and to their know-how and spirit of innovatio=
n, they have succeeded in maintaining their leading position.

The intrinsic value of the "Swiss made" label, therefore, is the result of=
 considerable efforts on the part of watchmaking companies, who are ultima=
tely responsible for maintaining its reputation.

sincerely,

Ila Grimes
Sales Manager

FROM THE DESK OF:
MR.CHEUNG PUI
HANG SENG BANK LTD.
DES VOEUX RD.BRANCH
CENTRAL HONG KONG
HONG KONG.

Dear Friend,

I am Mr.Cheung Pui, credit officer of Hang Seng Bank Ltd, Hong Kong. I 
have an urgent and  very confidential business proposition for you.

On october 6, 1999, an American consultant/contractor with  the Chinese
Solid  Minerals Corporation,Mr. Smith Lawrence made a (Fixed) Deposit for=

twelve calendar months, valued at US$68,000,000.00 (six-eight Million  Do=
llars
only) in my branch.
Upon maturity,I sent a routine  notification to his forwarding address bu=
t
got no reply. After a month, we  sent a reminder and finally we discovere=
d
from his contract employers, the  Hong Kong Solid Minerals Corporation th=
at
Mr. Smith Lawrence died from an  automobile accident. On further investig=
ation,I
found out that he died  without making  a will, and all attempts to trace=

his next of kin was  fruitless.

I therefore made further investigation and discovered that  Mr. Smith Law=
rence
did not declare any kin or relations in all his  official documents, incl=
uding
his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$68,000,000.00 is st=
ill
sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the princip=
al
sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come
forward to claim it.

According to the Hong Kong Law,under china's foreign and defense affairs,=
at
the expiration of 5 (five) years,such funds will revert to the ownership
of the chinese Government for financing military operations,such as purch=
asing
of arms
and ammunitions for the military.


In order to avert this negative development,i will like to seek for your
permission as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Mr. Smith Lawren=
ce
so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not be use for financing
weapons which will further enhance the courses of war in the world in gen=
eral.


The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of
60% for me and 30% for you and 10% for Expenses Incurred in the course of=

the transaction.There is no risk at all as all the paperwork  for this tr=
ansaction
will be done by my attorney and with my position as the credit officer gu=
arantees
the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested,pleas=
e
reply immediately.

Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more  details and that
will help you understand the transaction.


You should observe utmost confidentiality,and rest assured  that this  tr=
ansaction
would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assi=
stance
to invest my share in your country.

Awaiting your urgent reply.

Thanks and regards.

Mr.Cheung Pui.

HouseRaising Inc. OTCBB: HRAI

Net Assets of over 7,000,000

1,100,000 in Homebuilding and Renovation Sales Under Construction.

(Source: News Announcement 9/14/04)

Current Price. 0.48


A massive PR  campaign  is  being  launched  this Weekend and Monday
could be a huge day in the Stock.

Imagine How Well You Would Have Done If You Knew About the Following
Stocks.

OTCBB:LENF: Exploded from .75 on  September  1st  to   6.28  October
14th. Up over 700%.

OTCBB:AZGS:  Closed  at .50 on September 1st. This bad boy closed at
2.00 on October 7th, Up 300%.

These are  the  types  of  gains  you  can  find  with small unknown
companies. You may agree it is hard to get these types of gains from
large cap stocks. The question you need to answer  for  yourself  is
Will HRAI be next to power higher?


About HouseRaising Inc.

HouseRaising  was  formed in 1999 to utilize experiences gained from
40 years in the design/build  business  to combine the advantages of
today's   technology    with    local    homebuilding    operations.
HouseRaising's  focus  is its management system and business process
that allows the duplication of a time-tested and successful regional
homebuilding operation in 150 locations simultaneously.

HouseRaising  does  not  own  land,   nor  does  the  company  build
speculative homes.  HouseRaising  is  a  design/build  company  that
markets  its  products and services to homebuyers and small builders
who have customers desiring  to  build a unique home. HouseRaising's
regional operations are staffed with local  employees  and  builders
that  utilize  an  electronic management process to pre-sell, design
and build quality  residences  on  a  lot  owned  by the homebuyers.
HouseRaising pre-arranges financing  for  projects  secured  in  the
names of the buyers.

HRI   owns   an   Internet   based   management   process   that  is
revolutionizing the way  custom  homes  are  designed and built. The
company receives  revenues  from  royalties  and  from  net pro fits
realized    from    regional    design/build    operations.   Though
HouseRaising's intellectual  property  and  franchise  is unique and
sophisticated, our business is easy to understand and follow.


HRI    functions    through    two    wholly-owned     subsidiaries,
HouseRaisingUSA, LLC and HouseRaisingAcademy, LLC.


HouseRaisingUSA is.

HouseRaisingUSA,  LLC  (HR-USA)  will  establish  12  zones  and 150
regional  design/build  and  renovation  companies.  These  regional
companies function as  design/build  and  renovation operations that
each sells, designs and builds 50 custom  homes  and  50  renovation
projects  annually.  HouseRaisingUSA  is  the  people  side  of  the
business,  linking  homebuyers,  homebuilders  to affiliated vendors
essential to create quality homes.


HouseRaisingAcademy is.

HouseRaisingAcademy,  LLC  (HRA)   is   an  Internet  based  process
management and training operation, providing electronic support  and
training for design/build and renovation franchisees.

The  Academy  identifies  the who, what, how, when, where and why of
3,400 tasks conducted  on  each  project  thereby  ensuring that the
tasks are completed successfully each time and every time.

HRA  will make online seminars and training available to homebuyers,
homebuilders  and  vendors.   The  Academy  also  provides  national
marketing for  affiliated  builders  and  vendors.  (Source: Company

About The Company

The primary objective of HPNG is to participate in specialty finance
within  the  public  and  private markets.  Hampden has partnerships
with finance and in  surance  companies to provide collateral backed
high yield short-term financing.

Hampden is a unique  finance  company  that uses new technologies to
help  track  and  protect  loan  portfolio  assets.   The   use   of
sophisticated  tracking  technology significantly lowers the risk of
high yield lending and  allows  the  company  to benefit from unique
situations and under serviced investments.  In addition to  physical
asset  backed  lending, Hampden Grp. will  also actively participate
in  structured  financial  contracts  with  small  public  companies
through  PIPE  (private   investment  public  entity)  transactions.
Hampden plans to service private and small publicly traded companies
that have a need for short-term working capital  and  cannot  obtain
traditional financing.

Hampden's  business  plan  provides  collateralized   financing   to
its  customers with annualized rates of return greater than 25=
%. The
company's valuation, financial  ratios, executive compensation, exit
strategy, and other management decisions are  driven  directly  from
the business plan.

(Source: News Announcement 10/15/04)

Will  HPNG explode higher as more and more investors become aware of
the stock? If you think so, you may not want to wait until it is too
late. Remember, timing your trade  is  critical. Good Luck and Happy
Trading.

Attention.

I am ALHAJI usman latif , Retired Colonel and ADC
(Military Assistant) to UNITA Leader, Jonas Savimbi
(DECEASED); Angola's Jonas Savimbi, legendary
guerrilla leader of UNITA (the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola), who was
killed by communist MPLA (Popular Movement for the
Liberation of Angola) forces in combat February 2002
.please see some Angola gold and Diamond related
websites:-

http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/africa/newsid_1839000/1839252.stm
http://www.the-idler.com/IDLER-02/3-16.html
http://www.globalpolicy.org/socecon/tncs/angola.htm
http://www.un.org/peace/africa/Diamond.html
http://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/afrec/subjindx/144diam.htm
http://www.idrc.ca/reports/read_article_english.cfm?article_num=1069
http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/issues/diamond/

In addition to my official job, I was also in charge
of the consolidated budget and personal finances of
the late leader; these include Gifts, anonymous
donations from individuals and Countries; Also
revenues from Crude Oil gold sales and
Diamond/Precious Stones etc. When UNITA fortunes and
conditions began to deteriorate rapidly, I took the
precaution of
converting ALL money and liquid ASSETS INTO CUT
DIAMONDS and GOLD The estimated Value of the Diamonds
which have full GIA (Gemmological Institute of
America) certification is 75USD million. ( calculated
at current average market price of $5,200 per kilo).


Graded from GIA scale D to M ;Emerald, Heart,
Marquise, Oval, Pear, Princess, Radiant and Triangle
(Trillion) shapes; The Diamonds are in small carats
which are very easy to brokerUnfortunately for me,
after Jonas Savimbi's death, my personal safety and
life came under threat by Government Security Agents,
who promptly seized my International Passport, and
froze my Bank Accounts. I eventually made away with my
diamond cash worth about Seventy five million dollar
to COTE D'IVOIRE, another country in Africa where I
kept it in a security company, for safe keeping I
believe the time is now ripe to remove the diamonds
and gold to safety abroad, and I need your help and
assistance.

I have consequently arranged to ship out the
consignment of Diamonds and gold through a Shipping
company in ABIDJAN THE CAPITAL CITY OF COTE D'IVOIRE,
and I need a willing partner to Receive» the
Consignment on my behalf. The consignment will be
shipped to you (as African art ) not as gold and
diamond for security reason and you will collect the
consignment on my behalf and keep it in safe custody.

 At this stage, You have to contact  Diamond and gold
Vendor in your area to purchase the diamondsIf you
agree to help me, then your share will be 30% in
diamonds and gold or $22.500.000 minimum net, after
the diamonds and gold are sold. There is no risk in
this venture; and because the Diamonds and gold are
fully certified, you will not be breaking your
Countrys or international law! The Consignment will
arrive your end by Air cargo, and fully insured

If you are interested, please send me immediately the
following information:
(1) Your complete name
(2) Your Full address ( this will be the consignee
address through which you will receive the Diamond
cargo consignment)
(3) Your Telephone and Fax numbers.

I will arrange the shipment of the Diamond and gold
consignment to you; and advise you accordingly. I am
looking forward to doing business with you and I also
appeal to you to observe the highest level of
confidentiality even if you decline to help me!

Sincerely,
 
ALHAJI USMAN LATIF

Is there some way to have the default-fcc folder not appear right after 
your inbox, but be sorted asciibetically with the rest of the folders in 
the collection? I'm trying to group my most-used folders at the top, and 
this is not one of them :-).

I am contacting you based on the official letter I just received from his bankers reminding me that Senegalese law states that at the expiration of 5 =28five=29 years the money will revert to the ownership of the Senegalese Government=2EIf I do not confirm the next of kin to claim the fund=2E 

Consequently=2C my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kinto Mr=2E Daniel Thorp so that the fruits of this old man=92s labor will not go into the hands of some corrupt government officials=2E Note that this transaction is simple and risk free because I will provide expert legal services that will guarantee the successful 
execution of this deal=2E

I wish to point out that after the claims=2C I would want 20% of this money to be shared among charity organizations=2C while the remaining 80% is 
shared equally between us=2E Most importantly=2C I would also require your assistance towards investing my share in your country or anywhere as 
you may advice=2E 

If you are interested=2C please contact me via my email address =3Adavidclovis=5Fesq=40fsmail=2EnetUpon your response=2C I shall provide you with more details and how we shall proceed with the claims=2E I expect you to observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be profitable for both of us=2E

Awaiting your urgent reply via my email=2E

Thanks & Regards

Dr=2EDavid Clovis =28Esq=2E=29

Hi! My laptop crashed while using PINE,
and now the POSTPOND message folder is corrupt:

    Invalid UID 00001682 in message 452, rebuilding UIDs
    Unable to find CRLF at 11143508 in 64 bytes, text:

    No folder opened

I have read the really old archived message in the
pine-info listserv, but I am not a programmer and
cannot understand how to fix my POSTPOND folder.

Your assistance is appreciated!

(!@$ list server thought my message was a command..)

View by thread is showing me two messages out of order:

+   4267 Oct 21   Tony Sanchez      (4836) Re: Texas Hold'em Poker Tournament   
+ A 4268 Oct 21   Tony Sanchez      (3267) Texas Hold'em Poker Tournament       

I responded to the second one and got the reply.

I think this is because the Dates in the messages are wrong..
the second one has:
Date: Thu, 21 Oct 2004 18:27:57 -0700

the reply has:
Date: Thu, 21 Oct 2004 14:40:34 -0700 (PDT)

I don't know exactly how the first message supposedly came out at 6:30 tonight..

But don't the message-IDs have the proper 'message/response' order implicitly
in them?

change the subject to start a new topic -- it messes up threaded email viewing.

Hi

This patch was sent to me over email, and was apparently submitted to the
pine developers as well.  It still applies cleanly against 4.61.  Sorry I
don't have the original authors name, but I still have the patch. :-)

To use it after compilation, edit your .pinerc file and modify your
ldap-servers configuration item.   Add the following modifiers at the
end of the line, like the bogus example here:

/binddn=cn=othermark,cn=Users,dc=pine,dc=uwashington,dc=edu/bindpw=p4tchm3n0w

in other words to the end of a directory entry:

/binddn=<binddn>/bindpw=<password>

The 'patch-be' file can be dropped seamlessly into the 'files' sub-directory
in your freebsd ports directory for pine 4.61.  Simply 'make clean' &&
'make WITH_LDAP=yo'

Enjoy,

Fortunately, this doesn't happen often.  Unlike mailbox files on UNIX, it 
isn't often that PC-Pine mailbox files are corrupted.

The instructions in
 	http://www.washington.edu/imap/IMAP-FAQs/index.html#7.15
will explain how to fix this file manually.  But if you aren't skilled 
with programming, those instructions may not be helpful to you.

The easiest recovery procedure is to delete the POSTPOND file; but I 
notice that it seems to be at least 11MB so maybe there's valuable data in 
there.

As a special favor, I'm willing to repair the file for you.  If you like, 
rename the file to something else.  Send the file under its new name to me 
as a MIME attachment.  I will repair it, and then send the repaired 
version back to you.

Please send it just to me, and not to all of pine-info.

Engr.Evans Sipe

E-mail: evanssipe@netscape.net


FOR YOUR KIND ATTENTION.

It is my great pleasure to write you this letter on behalf of my colleagu=
es.
I got your information from a personal search in the internet business in=
dex.
I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in execution
of a deal hereunder for the benefit of all parties, and hope you will kee=
p
it confidential because of the nature of this business.

Within the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources where I work as a Dir=
ector
of Project Implementation, and with co-operation of four other top offici=
als,
we have in our possession, an overdue payment in US funds. The said funds=

represent certain percentage of the contract value executed on behalf of
my Ministry by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-in=
voiced
to the amount of US$14,600,000.00 (Fourteen Million, Six Hundred Thousand=

United States Dollars). Though the actual contract cost has been paid to
the original contractor, leaving the excess balance unclaimed.

Since the present elected Government is determined to pay foreign contrac=
tors
all debts owed, so as to maintain good relations with foreign governments=

and non-governmental financial agencies. As a result we included ours bil=
ls
for approvals with the co-operation of some officials at the Department
of Finance and the Reserve Bank of South Africa (RBSA). We are seeking yo=
ur
assistance as the beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we are not al=
lowed
to operate a foreign account.

I have the authority of my colleagues involved to propose that,should you=

be willing to assist us in this transaction your share as compensation wi=
ll
be 25% while my colleagues and I receive 70%, and the balance of 5% for
taxes and miscellaneous expenses incurred.

It does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects of
the nature described here. The assumption is that your company won the ma=
jor
contract and subcontracted it to other companies. More often than not, bi=
g
trading companies and firms of unrelated fields wins major contracts and
subcontract to more specialized firms for execution.

I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint=

me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my above stated e-mail add=
ress
above,to indicate whether or not you are interested in this deal. 
I want to assure you that my partners and myself are in a position
to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a ver=
y
strong assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured.It is impor=
tant
that you treat this matter with utmost CONFIDENTIALITY as any form of exp=
osure
will negatively affect us since we are still in active Government Service=
.


Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful exe=
cution
of this transaction.I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you=

will not disappoint us.

Kindly notify me by email for further details, upon your acceptance of th=
is
proposal.

Regards,

Evans Sipe.

NB; PLS REPLY TO THIS EMAIL ADDRESS (evanssipe@netscape.net). Thanks

Huh? Is it common on UNIX that mailbox files are corrupted?

Can't say I have noticed, guess I'm lucky :)

It isn't UNIX per se, but rather personal computer vs. timesharing 
systems.

Anything that abnormally aborts whatever program is updating the mailbox 
can potentially corrupt it.  Timesharing systems have many more 
opportunities to abort programs; they are just naturally more hostile than 
personal computers.

UNIX Pine running on a non-timeshared UNIX system (e.g. a Linux PC with 
only one user who uses the console) is more or less the same circumstance 
as PC Pine.  I certainly would not say that you should replace Linux with 
Windows! :-)

Of course, Pine and imapd always try hard not to abort, and try hard to 
catch external conditions which would make them abort.

I hope this proposal will not come to you as a surprise as you do not kno=
w
who I am please kindly treat as urgent and confidential.

Following the sudden death of my husband General Sani Abacha the late for=
mer
head of state of Nigeria in June (1998), I have been thrown into a state
of utter confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the present civilian
administration, I have been subjected to physical and psychological tortu=
re
by the security agents in the country. 

My son was only recently released from detention due to health related re=
ason,
he was initiallydetained for an offence he did not commit, he is still be=
ing
arraigned before the federal high  court of Nigeria till date. As a widow=

that is so traumatizing for me,I have lost confidence with anybody within=

the country. You must have heard over the media reports and the Internet
on the recovery of various huge sums of money deposited by my husband in
different security firms abroad, some companies willingly give up their
secrets and disclosed our money confidently lodged there or many outright=

blackmail. In fact, the total sumdiscovered by the Government so far is
in the tune of ($700) Million dollars. 

Moreover, they are not relenting to make me poor for life. I got your con=
tacts
through my personal research, and out of desperation decided to reach you=

through this medium. I will give  you more information as to this regard
as soon as you reply. I repose great confidence in you  hence my approach=

to you due to security network placed on my day to day affairs I cannot
afford  to visit the embassy so that is why I decided to contact you and
I hope you will not betray my confidence in you.

I have deposited the sum of ($15) million dollars with a security firm ab=
road
whose name is  withheld for now until we open communication. I shall be
grateful if you could receive this fund  into your account for safekeepin=
g.
You and my son Mustapha Abba Abacha alone know this  arrangement, so my
son will deal directly with you as security is up my whole being. I am se=
riously
considering to settle down abroad in a friendly atmosphere like yours as
soon as this fund get into your account so that I can start all over agai=
n
if only you wish, but if it is  impossible, just help me in diverting thi=
s
fund into your account which will accrue you (30%) of this fund. Please
honesty is the watchword in this transaction. I will require your telepho=
ne
and fax numbers so that we can commence communication immediately and I
will give you a more detailed picture of things. In case you do not accep=
t,
please do not let me out to the security as I am giving you this informat=

in total trust and confidence .I will greatly appreciate if you accept my=

proposal in good faith. Please expedite action. you can indicate so by yo=

Alexey,

I put my sent-mail folder inside a subdirectory of mail (so I actually 
have a sent-mail folder whose full path is 
"~/mail/2004/sent-mail-oct-2004"). In this case, the 2004 directory is 
listed alphabetically, not as the first element in the list.

<DIV>
<DIV><BR>URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP<BR>I am Alhaji Mohammed Abacha, the son of the late Nigerian Head of State<BR>who died on the 8th of June 1998 while in active services. Following the sudden death of my father, General Sani Abacha, the present Civilian Government has thrown my family and I into a state of utter confusion,frustration,and hopelessness. I have been subjected to inhuman physical and physiological torture,incarceration by the security Agents in my country. I was only recently released from detention after been arraigned before<BR>the Federal High Court of Nigeria for an offence committed by my late father.</DIV>
<DIV>The incumbent civilian administration of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo has intensified his probe into my late father's activities while in the office and he has frozen all our<BR>local and foreign accounts together with other assets of my family as a retaliation for what my late father did to him when he was alive as the Head of the Military regime in Nigeria. As a matter of fact, we have been declared bankrupt and they are not relenting to make us poor for life. As a man that is so traumatized, I have lost confidence with within my country as all those who benefited immensely during the regime of my late father&nbsp; have openly abandoned all my family. MY REASONS FOR CONTACTING YOU. <BR>I got your contacts through my personal research and out of desperation decided <BR>to reach you through this medium. You must have heard over the media reports and the Internet on the recovery of various huge sums of money deposited by my late father in different Banks and security firms ab!
road. Some of these banks and<BR>security firms willingly gave-up/divulge their banking secrets and disclosed to the present civilian administration of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, all my family's cash&nbsp; lodgement and<BR>monetary transactions with them. Please my dear, I repose great confidence in you and I hope you will not betray my confidence in you. I have secretly deposited the sum of $20,000,000.00 with a security firm abroad whose name is withheld for now until we open communications.

	Does Pine Version 4 ask to omit attachments?
	Pine 3.95 that I'm using on a shared system without direct ability
to install software TELLS me that it will omit attachments, then it omits
the headers, too, IFF a multipart message is composed entirely of
attachments.

	This is something that PINE won't send, so it's probably a no-no
for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, but spammers START with the
intention of violating protocol, so is Version four more robust in this
respect? IOW, will it at least send the headers?

	This forced me recently to forward some spam (to the abuse account
at the offending site) as a MIME digest, which is also breaking protocol
for administrative newbies that at abuse accounts that can't accept
any attachments.

	Still, when forwarding messages, it would be nice if I could pick
and choose which attachments I relay. Like, I can do a cursory inspection
of attachments, looking for text like "helo world.ca", but often the
question is whether to send duplications.

In order to prevent a repetition of this sally the Tatars at once invested
the gates, so that if the Turks should open them they were as likely to let
their foes in as to oppose them. While the tents were being moved up Rob had
an opportunity to search the battlefield for the bodies of the three Turks
who had robbed him, but they were not among the fallen
Those fellows were too cowardly to take part in a fair fight, declared the
boy; but he was much disappointed, nevertheless, as he felt very helpless

FROM THE DESK OF OKOFOR DAVID
Branch Accounts Manager,
Prudent Bank Nigeria Limited,
Falomo Office Complex,
Ikoyo, Lagos.
Nigeria.

DEAR FRIEND, 
 
On SUNDAY, February 2, 2003, a bomb blast explosion took place on the Lag=
os
Island, right inside My bank; So far a total lost of about US$20.5 millio=
n
has been recorded, this includes both cash and property of the bank. Plea=
se
View the Link below:
 
http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/02/03/lagos.explosion/index.html

However as the Accounts Manager of the BANK,I discovered Most of our Data=

on accounts has been lost as well, as there has not been anyback up or ne=
twork
trace even from the HEADQUARTERS;therefore all losses would be artributed=

to the! Explosion. The lagos State Government has taken charges to pay fo=
r
all losses. 
 
I found out i still have Data's of foreign Customers who are contractors
in Nigeria and who own accounts with the Branch, Particularly that of an
American oil contractor Hsu Ben, who was reported Dead in a plane crash[K=
orean
Air Flight 801] with the whole passengers  aboard on August  6,1997.And
for your  perusal you can view this website:

http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9708/06/guam.passenger.list/

who's contract payments has been Made and would be tranfered to his forei=
gn
accounts from the CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA, upon our confirmation of his
foreign designated account as well as a beneficiary to his funds and paym=
ents.

 
Mr Hsu Ben, while our customer never left a trace of his next of kin, and=

His contract Payment which is about US$15M, would be made to no one as we=
(
the bank) has! none of his Data/next of kin's contact. 
 
My proposal is that I will like you as a foriegner to stand in as the nex=
t
of kin to Mr Hsu Ben,  so that the fruits of this old man's labor will no=
t
get into the hands of some corrupt government officials, Besides the Bank=

which i work in has been blown up, i have no Job for now, i have to make
a living and only me knows the information so far about this.

This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names an=
d
address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and aff=
idavits
which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the servi=
ce
of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain th=
e
necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favour
for the transfer. 
 
A bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will then
facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of
kin. The money will be paid into your account as payment for his Contract=

by t! he CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA upon my submission of the Contract infor=
mation
and your application as his next of kin for us to share in the ratio of
70% for me, 20% for you and 10% will be use to cover all the expensives
that will come-up in the course of this transaction.
  
There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be=

done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Accounts Manager guara=
ntees
the successful execution of this transaction.
 
Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and releva=
nt
documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe
utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be
most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to=

invest my share in your country.
 
Your phone and fax number are need for easy communication.
   
Awaiting your urgent response.
Your Faithfully.
MR. OKOFOR DAVID

Dear Sir,

My name is Mr Koffi Ansah,I work in executive capacity with TRUST 
SECURITY
COMPANY (ltd) Accra Ghana.
I joined the services of this company in 1991.
I got the information concerning you and your company
from our Chamber of Commerce here and after due
consultation, I decided to contact you believing that
by the grace of God that you will be my
partner in this business.
I have worked with this company for over 12 years,
within this period of time I watched with meticulous
precision onhow African Head of State and government
functionaries have been moving huge sums of money
(Dollars, PoundSterling, French Franc, Cash)with the
aid of their foreign partners abroad.
They bring in these consignment of money cash and
secretly declare the content as jewelries, Gold,
Precious Stones, Family Treasure, Documents,etc.
Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, Fodey Sankoy of Sierra
Leone, Felix Houphet Buigny of Ivory Coast, Konnan
Bede of Ivory Coast, etc.
These people have at one time or the other
deposited consignments with us and their foreign
partners, relatives and Next of Kin are Claiming most
of these consignment and a lot more are laying here
unclaimed for as much as 7 years, as no available
information to anybody except the depositors, and most of them are 
dead.
Since the inception of the year 2003, TRUST SECURITY COMPANY LTD 
Management changed the procedure of claiming of consignments.
As soon as you are able to produce all the secret information as containe=
d
in the secret file of the
company as regard the consignment, it will be released to you upon 
demand.
From our records, more than 10 consignments belonging to these people 
has been claimed in the past six months and this is why I am seeking for

your co-operation and assistance.
Mr. Martin Greenberg  was an American,he worked with
one of the top ministers of President Robert Mugabe
who was in charge of the campaigning for re-electing
Mr. Mugabe into office in their last election. He
deposited this consignment containing 35.5 million
United State Dollars ($35.5m USD)early in 1999, this
money according to him was to be used for further
political programmes.
He died in the plane crash of 31 October 1999 with the Wife[on the 
Egyptian 990] with reports on CNN as you can verify via the CNN website
as 
stated 
below:
http://www.cnn.com/us/9911/02/egyptair990.list/index.html,He died 
alongside with other passengers aboard without leaving any relations as
his wife 
died as well in the same plane crash.
Since his death, no one knows about this transaction
with TRUST SECURITY COMPANY ltd except me who acted
as company attorney when he deposited the consignment.
I have finished every arrangement for you to come and
claim the consignment as the next of Kin to Mr. Martin Greenberg
 The procedure is very simple: - Apply officially to the Director of oper=
ation
Trust 
security company Ltd Accra - Ghana, for the release of consignment 
No.TSC/15031964.
They will demand for some documents and the security
code of the consignment, you will call on me to supply you with every 
detailed Information as regard the consignment.
As soon as they have confirmed it to be correct, the
company will invite you for the collection.
Nobody will ever know that I am involved in the deal
, I suggest upon conclusion, we share it on the Ratio
of 50%-40%and 10% will go for humanitarian service ie
motherless babies home, more also you will make an
arrangement on investments that I will invest my money
in your country.
I assure you that this business is very secure and
risk free.
Please, if you are interested on this proposal,
kindly let me know.
Thanks
Mr Koffi Ansah

   Hey,

   I'm in the process of switching to console only -- doing away 
with X, & while I've got images working in w3m & fbi (a 
framebuffer image viewer), pine suspends fine when I open a url in 
pine, but won't do so for fbi.  So, I don't get to look at the 
images.

   How would I get pine to let me look at an image attached to an 
e-mail in console?

   Meph
